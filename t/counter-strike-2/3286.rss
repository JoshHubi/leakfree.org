<h2>Out of wikipedia (I know, it’s not perfectly reliable, but these are quotes):</h2>
<p>Source distantly originates from the GoldSrc engine, itself a heavily modified version of the QuakeWorld  iteration of John D. Carmack’s Quake engine, as is explained by Valve employee Erik Johnson on the Valve Developer Community:[30]</p>
<pre><code>"When we were getting very close to releasing Half-Life (less than a week or so), we found there were already some projects that we needed to start working on, but we couldn't risk checking in code to the shipping version of the game. At that point we forked off the code in VSS to be both $/Goldsrc and /$Src. Over the next few years, we used these terms internally as "Goldsource" and "Source". At least initially, the Goldsrc branch of code referred to the codebase that was currently released, and Src referred to the next set of more risky technology that we were working on. When it came down to show Half-Life 2 for the first time at E3, it was part of our internal communication to refer to the "Source" engine vs. the "Goldsource" engine, and the name stuck."
</code></pre>
<p>Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve’s internal projects[31] and explaining in part the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve’s development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed middleware (Havok Physics, albeit heavily modified, and MP3 playback) and in-house-developed code.</p>
<h2>John Carmack commented on his blog in 2004 that “there are still bits of early Quake code in Half-Life 2”</h2>
<p>Everything there implies that source branched off from goldsrc.</p>

<p>Well, you CAN spray if you know how to adjust for recoil properly. If the guy’s around 10 or 20 feet away, I find that aiming to the left of his feet after a few shots usually gets me a headshot with the AK. With an MP5 all you have to do is crouch and aim for the head, while moving it down slightly.</p>
<p>All the weapons have different types of recoil. Learn how to compensate for them, and you can spray much more effectively. Just pointing at the guy and holding the mouse button down isn’t going to do anything but waste ammo.</p>

<p>No, not every gun can get one-hit kills (another reason why it’s not noob-friendly, shit can get confusing). Only the snipers, the AK, the shotgun, and the deagle will always kill someone with a shot to the head at 100% health (even if they’re wearing a helmet). Lighter guns like the M4 can kill with a single shot, but not if they’re wearing a helmet. Sure, it’ll take out most of their health, and they’re pretty much screwed, but they can still shoot back.</p>
<p>Also, spraying is a pretty poor technique unless you have a SMG and/or you’re at close range. At distance the recoil makes anything more than a small burst really impractical.</p>

Also, when I’m not playing with friends I’m using the chatbox, and since usually the idiots flood that with stupid “omg AWP n00b” it’s hard to communicate. And yes that stuff is aimed at me. I sniped alot when I was still playing it and I mostly hit the enemies in the head with the AWP and just used it for the mobility and bad lag compensated bodyshots that where supposed to be headshots so I could get the kill anyway. And still they called me a n00b. Also hackers: Usually not that much of a problem but it’s annoying when my team can’t deal with them.</p>

            <p>people are assholes, a fact of life. luckily Steam makes it easy to stack your team with friends, combine that with Ventrillo, googletalk or Skype and your all set to have a good time.</p>

<p>CS is good though, it’s really not that bad, and was the best multi-player experience for a while IMO. i think it got worse with each release though, the game was at first intended to be a tactical team based game, it quickly evolved into a arcade team deathmatch shooter though, thank god for mods spicing the game up though, that’s what added so many years to it’s lifespan.</p>
<p>Tactical Insertion is what the creator would have done with CS2, perhaps, if it’s good, Valve will make another Counter-Strike.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is kinda good. If it just wasn’t for almost every multiplayer having an extremely shitty community I’d love them.</p>

<p>Weapon customization doesn’t make a game a good game <em>points at MW2</em>. If CS 2 comes out I expect a complete overhaul to make it less shitty.</p>
