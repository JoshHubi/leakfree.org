    <description>Anyone playing this ARMA2 mod? Been getting reeeeally interested in this. Looks like a very cool and challenging game. And since Steam is having their summer sale, ARMA2 combine ops is $24 USD. 

Anyway, read a few articles on just how brutal this mod can be.</description>

            <p>I am also waiting for the standalone version. I have Arma 2, but not Operation Arrowhead, and actually don’t want to spend 15 euro on it. Well, depends on what the standalone version is going to cost.</p>

<p>It’s not like it has to be complete for it to go standalone. They’re going to follow the Minecraft model, in that they will update it as time goes on and prices will be adjusted as it enters Beta as well as into the final version.</p>

<p>lol. You’re not the only one. Let me know if you get your hands on a copy. The game is unplayable solo, as you need someone else to do blood transfusion. Its also awfully buggy in its current state. I keep getting insane graphical artifacts when walking into Cherno. Bugs aside, the concept is pretty darn epic.</p>

            <p>You sound like J.R.R Tolkien.</p>
<p>But yeah, I know that feel bro; we had a quadbike and it flipped when it hit a bridge road, it went flying miles. We lived but lost our loot, there was a lot of loot. The second time with another quadbike, it randomly burst into flames, no tree and I died. Luckily he waited for me to run from the beach and collect my loot.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Riding down the blissful country side with my friends, reminiscing on all the adventures we have had together, I happen to notice a downed helicopter. It was sitting there, all lonely, beckoning my presence. So I relay to my fellows of the chopper’s whereabouts and we park our van under a nice shady tree along side the road. We hop out and proceed to form our regular perimeters as two of my buddies make their way to the lonesome chopper.</p>
<p>What a plethora of finds! There was a medical box filled to the brim, AS50 and camo for all! We must be lucky, we had all thought, as we made our way back to the van. As we all took our sits, the tree let appear a grin. As we hit the gas and made our way forward the tree let out a NOPE.avi. A ball of flame consumed my visage and our van was flipped in the air. Our spoils were gone and our bodies to ashes. Thank you mister tree.</p>

            <p>DayZ is fuckhard. It can be an awesome game at times but at other times it’s just a general pain in the ass. You run around and suddenly a zombie that is 3 times faster then you bursts out and chases you with the use of crappy animations. But when you finally find a decent gun and stuff it is a very rewarding game. Just make sure that you have someone you can play with because you can heal each other  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, after a little more research I found out he was a dev for Bohemia. Most likely they are giving him the green light to make a standalone using the engine. An updated version of the engine I hope.</p>

            <p>Apparently from what I can tell from the forums. He will be stopping development on the ‘mod’ and focusing on the actual standalone game. Not sure what tech he’s going to be using.</p>

            <p>Hm, kinda confusing. Is he saying that when it goes standalone in September, ARMA2 will no longer be required to play the game? Did he license the game engine or something? because I gotta think if he puts out a game based on ARMA2 and is going to charge for it, that there would be a whole slew of licensing issues.</p>
<p>But yeah, looks like I am going to be waiting until September.</p>

            <p>I played it at a pals house and loved it. That being said, I’m holding off on buying ARMA II because of <a href="https://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a392296/day-z-going-standalone-in-september-adopting-minecraft-model.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this article.</a></p>

            <p>Anyone playing this ARMA2 mod? Been getting reeeeally interested in this. Looks like a very cool and challenging game. And since Steam is having their summer sale, ARMA2 combine ops is $24 USD.</p>
<p>Anyway, read a few articles on just how brutal this mod can be.</p>
