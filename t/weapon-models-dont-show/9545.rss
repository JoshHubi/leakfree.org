    <title>Weapon models don&#39;t show</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/weapon-models-dont-show/9545</link>
    <description>The first person weapon models don&#39;t show / render for me. I see this with the crowbar and pistol, as that is how far I&#39;ve progressed in the game. To further test the glitch, I used the sv_cheats 1 and impulse 101 commands to attain all weapons, and the others don&#39;t to display a model either. Also, certain weapon sounds do not play, such as the reload sfx for the pistol. 

I&#39;m playing the game in Windows XP running via bootcamp on a late 2009 iMac.</description>

            <p>Hey guys. I was having the same issue, and no amount of verifying and reinstalling (from two diff downloads) helped.</p>
<p>In the end I managed to solve it though by simply restarting the game at beginning of Unforseen Consequences and blitzing through to where the crowbar is (didn’t pick anything up - that could be key!) - Now everything works as it should  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Awesome game!</p>

            <p>I SOLVED that problem by redownloading the mod from an official mirror (the first time it was not an official one) and reinstalling it. The problem is gone !</p>

            <p>Having the same problem here too. I can shoot, I can hit stuff with the crowbar, but the weapons are invisible. Also I cannot seem to manually reload with the gun.</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bits, Intel Core i5 3570K, nVidia GeForce GTX 680 with latest drivers.</p>
