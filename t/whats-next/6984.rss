    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/whats-next/6984</link>
    <description>Guys, I&#39;m a newbie to this amazing world of Halflife. I have recently completed HL1 and I&#39;m about half done with HL2...

I have passed Portal too.

And now I&#39;m thinking, do they plan to make one final game, not only Half Life not only Portal but to maybe merge these two epic games, to bring back Adrian, and to finally let us know more about Gman and his &quot;employers&quot;? What are your theories?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Valve ‘Probably’ Done With Single-Player Games<br>
Kotaku<br>
The makers of such acclaimed single-player video games as Portal and Half-Life 2 want all of their future games to support connected, non-solo gaming, in some way, at all levels.</p>
<p>That assertion first appeared in the Final Hours of Portal 2, journalist Geoff Keighley’s recent behind-the-scenes chronicle about Valve’s newest game. It’s an assertion he told me he heard directly from Valve founder Gabe Newell and the company’s project manager Erik Johnson.</p>
<p>“Portal 2 will probably be Valve’s last game with an isolated single-player experience,” Keighley wrote in Final Hours, “What this all means is something Newell is still trying to figure out.”</p>
<p>Keighley told me that he considered the comment “curious,” noting that the quality of the solo-only main campaign of Portal 2 was a fantastic piece of work. (I’ve checked with Valve on this, but they didn’t reply by press time.) The signs that solo-only modes are on their way are there, not just from within Valve but all around the pioneering games company.</p>
<p>Valve’s Portal 2 introduced multiplayer to the Portal games through a two-player co-op mode. The company’s recent 2008 and 2009 Left4Dead games were presented as a primarily-multiplayer experience, even on consoles where such an animal is about as rare as a Nintendo-made Halo game. Valve has also continued to aggressively support its multiplayer Team Fortress 2, a game launched alongside Portal in 2007.</p>
<p>Keighley: “Portal 2 will probably be Valve’s last game with an isolated single-player experience.”</p>
<p>The company’s primary vehicle for single-player-only experiences has been the one that the public hasn’t seen anything new of since 2007. The campaign portions of Half-Life put players in control of hero Gordon Freeman; other players haven’t been able to join the game’s main adventure. While Valve has used its Half-Life games to present a more lively, less lonely first-person-shooter campaign, it has done so strictly through improving the artificial intelligence and acting of Freeman’s computer-controlled allies, namely Alyx Vance (pictured with our hero above).</p>
<p>Outside of Valve single-player-only games have been vanishing. After a long stretch as leading single-player franchise, Super Mario games on consoles now include second-player support. Series that launch as solo-only such as Uncharted or BioShock add multiplayer for their second installment. Hold-outs like God of War seem destined to add support for multiple players, somehow, some way. A company like Capcom doesn’t just make millions with its four-player series Monster Hunter, but it’s slowly but surely been pushing its formerly single-player-only series, Resident Evil, into a vehicle for multiplayer console Resident Evil games (the upcoming co-op and competitive Operation Raccoon City) and multiplayer portable ones (the co-op Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D). Even Capcom’s Dragon’s Dogma, though single-player, simulates a multiplayer experience by giving the main player a host of computer-controlled allies who behave as joining Monster Hunter gamers might.</p>
<p>The comment from Valve is striking, though, in that it doesn’t sound like Newell and Johnson said they’d probably never ship a game that didn’t have a multiplayer mode somewhere in it. Rather, they told Keighley they “probably” wouldn’t make a game “with an isolated single-player experience.” That would mean no more modes that couldn’t connect in some fashion to other people. Would, say, letting a second player control Alyx in Half Life 3 do the trick? Or could Valve be cooking up something less expected?</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, I didn’t even bother reading your post once I saw the blue text. I guess I’m biased that way. If I did copy what you said ‘word for word’ it must have been subconsciously. I’d apologize for it too, if you didn’t needlessly erase any evidence there of.</p>

<p>Don’t really understand what you’re asking. Blue Shift was a mini game in the Dreamcast version of Half-life that was later canceled. That is why it has no new features – hope I helped…</p>

<p>Actually, if I would have known that someone was going to literally repeat me, then I wouldn’t have wasted my time answering the guy. I wasn’t confused about his answering him, just at the fact that he said what I said nearly word for word.<br>
So yes, it WAS a waste of my time. I don’t know if I ninja’d him, or if he meant to do it. Fact is, he wasted my time intentionally or not.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed opposing force, but don’t read too much into it. It’s just a fun add on for half life, no greater significance  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Hopefully episode 3 will answer all your questions. Of course, the one about Shephard will not be answered for reasons stated above.</p>
<p>Now, I’m thinking that Half Life 3 may delve deeper into the story of the G-man. We’ll find out a bit more about him in Episode 3, sure, but I really think HL3 is where he’ll play a more major role.</p>

            <p>I don’t know why you thought it was a good idea to not only re-answer his question, but to literally say the exact same thing as me in a less fashionable manner.</p>
<p>You literally just wasted my time.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]Welcome to the forums.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Now about your questions</span>;</p>
<p>You should probably finish Half-life 2. Then finish Episode 1 and Episode 2 before going on about that, but the truth is, no one really knows.</p>
<p>You can count on the fact that Adrian Shepard isn’t coming back seeing as how he was made by Gearbox and not Valve. Gearbox created Blue shift and Opposing Force by the way.<br>
We ironically just went over this in a sub-thread.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">About Portal and Half-life merging</span>;</p>
<p>They’re only partially related to the extent that Aperture Science is the competing science facility to Black Mesa.</p>
<p>You will learn more about that in Half-life 2 Episode 2 along with the Gman.</p>
<p>Portal 2 was just released, and it seems that they are striving to pull away from the fact that Half-life is involved. I’m guessing this is due to Portal’s unsuspected success, leading Valve to not want the Half-life Universe to tie down any possible plot modifications. This is probably because not everyone that plays Portal plays Half-life. That would be my guess as to why, but no one is sure.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Half-life :lambda:<br>
