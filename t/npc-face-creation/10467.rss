    <title>NPC Face creation</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/npc-face-creation/10467</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this counts as a question, but does face creation seem to be not in full effect for anybody else? I tried doing &quot;npc_create&quot; earlier and it looked like an army of clones, and even without that I&#39;ve bumped into a lot of &#39;twins&#39; throughout the mod so far. Is there something I need to put in console or are the differences really just that small?</description>
