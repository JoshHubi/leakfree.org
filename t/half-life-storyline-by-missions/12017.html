          <p>I have always been rather interested in how the Half-Life plot is presented, especially in HL1 and its remake. It is so subtle that it leads many to think that there is no purpose-driven plot for most of the game, but the missions that different people give you are actually incredibly logical, consistent and intuitive. When I was a kid and played Half-Life for the first time, I really only got the “get to the test chamber” and “kill nihilanth” parts of the plot; the beginning and the end. But I was a kid. Now, after years of playing and replaying Half-Life and now Black Mesa, I’ve become a nerd -the kind of nerd that gets stupidly excited at the sight of charts. So I made one all about it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to make a point other than how much of a bunch of geniuses Valve were. I know most Half-Life and Black Mesa fans will know all of this by heart. I just think it’d be fun to lay it out in such a way; I’m not making the point that the game would be better off with traditional game mission levels, but quite the opposite; Valve was one of the first to elegantly fit logical and instinctive missions throughout a continuous game. Some developers today could still learn from this narrative style.</p>
<p>That was the point of its critical acclaim; obviously many games already had a story (some really good ones too, mostly in adventure games and RPGs), but Valve made a totally linear game feel organic. How did they do it? By refining storytelling itself for an interactive medium; by having people in the game give you missions that are simple enough and make sense but, at the same time, move the plot along quite nicely; or better yet, they make YOU actually move the plot along. Things happen all around you, but you are the one who actually advances the plot; and you may not even notice it because your actions just make so goddamn sense in a very straightforward way. In other words, you can only do one thing; but it is what you would probably do anyway, so the world feels much greater than it actually is.</p>
<p>So, not only do they achieve this without the book-y medium of exposition, but they mostly dispense of the “show and don’t tell” film mantra: they use your intuitive interaction through the game to tell a story. Still, there is a big part of “show”, but it is in subtle scripted sequences and semi-hidden texts; they are there if YOU look for them, which adds interaction, instead of shoving them in your face. There is literally no necessary exposition. The sequels screw this up a little, but still excel at it overall.</p>
<p>In this chart, plot-centric chapters (e.g. Questionable Ethics), puzzle-centric chapters (e.g. Blast Pit) and boss-centric chapters (e.g. Gonarch’s Lair) do not constitute as missions themselves since none are explicitly given; if the game wasn’t linear, they could conceivably be ignored. From a mission-centric point of view, these are just obstacles in the way of the actual objective. However, plot-crucial sub-missions (On A Rail) are not ignored, since the completion of the main mission hinges directly on these. I’m including the ending too, although we don’t have it yet for Black Mesa.</p>

<p>If I get this OCD anytime soon, I might have to calm my nerves again by trying the same thing with Half-Life 2 and episodes, although I suspect they will actually be much shorter, especially in the episodes. In Episode One, you basically have two main missions: the core stabilization and the escape from the city. Maybe the ending escort mission can be considered a plot-vital sub-mission, but that’s a stretch. And, even though it is larger and feels more complex, there is also two main missions in Episode Two; reaching White Forest and defending the base, with the sub-missions of saving Alyx.</p>
<p>I hope that, maybe, this has helped some fans realize certain details on the structure and cohesion of the game that they might not have realized otherwise. But, honestly, most of all, I hope that really obsessive people find this kind of narrative layout as oddly soothing as I do.</p>

          <p>You preserve the vehicle because if you don’t you get a Game Over, but it is just transport. The vehicle levels are not actually connected to the mission of rescuing Eli Vance; you could’ve conceivably do the whole thing walking. I wouldn’t call it an actual sub-mission inside the mission of the rescue. It takes you closer to Eli, but as a plot device it does not enable his rescue in any particular way, as opposed to the havock you wreck in Nova Prospekt, which sparks the revolution (although there is no explicit mission given to do so).</p>
<p>It’s much closer in spirit to those puzzle/boss-centric chapters; an obstacle, but instead of a wall or Tentacles or a boss, the obstacle is just the length of the road. You are there because you are going to rescue Eli Vance; the mode of transport is “just” gameplay. The same goes for your Father Gregory sub-mission, really: that’s a gameplay objective; necessary in-game, but not really plot-centric. In a way, he’s really the one making his ‘plot objective’ by escorting you, but that’s beside the point.</p>
<p>The sequels are not as ‘pure’ in this approach, certainly, but I think those sub-missions do not apply. Why? Although, from a gameplay point of view, you can’t progress without fulfilling them (like the Tentacles in Blast Pit or the whole thing in Power Up), they aren’t more than obstacles; these mini-objectives don’t further the main missions from a plot-centric point of view.</p>
<p>The rocket launch activation ENABLED the plot to happen; it was literally necessary for the main “Get to Lambda and fix it” mission to happen: for the “fix it” part to become a reality, first the Lambda team have to try and fail to close the portal with the satellite (that you launch), thus realizing that Nihilanth is maintaining it, which in turn gives you the “fix”: kill Nihilanth. The rocket sub-mission CAUSES the main mission by which it is encompassed to be possible directly from the narrative itself, thereby enabling the existence of the following missions (kill the Nihilanth, accept the job, and the whole sequel plots). It is not just a roadblock, although it may be just that from a gameplay perspective.</p>

          <p>Yeah, that was my point. That’s why I myself did. I already knew the storyline, but seeing it organized is still great. It puts it front and center, while in-game you are not constantly reminded of your mission.</p>
<p>Sorry anout that “wreack” thing. This is my second language after all. Errors like that slip through easily. However, hopefully you won’t see me confuse “their” with “there’re” and similar atrocities, because I learnt the language academically. I have a ridiculously terrible accent, though.</p>

          <p>I really like this  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you’re just playing Half Life/BMS as a shooter, you won’t really notice anything. It’s just shoot and progress gameplay. But once you pay attention properly and really immerse yourself you see the game has a story/plot and that it really all does lead up to things.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I like that fact or not. All I know is that I liked it more in Half Life 2 where they kind of ‘told’ you what was happening. Call me small minded but it’s nice to have an obvious goal WITH story once in a while.</p>

<p>Mission 4.2 - Capture Mossman<br>
'Cos everyone hates backstabbers.<br>
Chapters: Nova Prospekt, Entanglement<br>
Given by Alyx during Entanglement<br>
Fulfilled/Reactivated at the end of Entanglement when Mossman is first captured, then escapes with Eli via Combine Teleporter.</p>
<p>Mission 4.3 - Escape from Nova Prospekt<br>
'Cos you better be like “POOF, GORDON BE GONE!”<br>
Chapters: Entanglement<br>
Given by Alyx at the moment Eli is rescued<br>
Fulfilled at the end of Entanglement.</p>
<p>Mission 5 - Uprising!<br>
'Cos everyone loves Stalingrad-esque CQB fighting!<br>
Given at the start of Anticitizen One by Dr. Kleiner<br>
Chapters: Anticitizen One, “Follow Freeman!”<br>
Fulfilled at the end of “Follow Freeman!”</p>
<p>Mission 5.1 - Reach the Citadel<br>

Given by Dr. Kleiner at the start of Anticitizen One<br>
Chapters: Anticitizen One, “Follow Freeman!”<br>
Fulfilled at the end of “Follow Freeman!”</p>
<p>Mission 6 - Infiltrate the Citadel<br>
Flashlight, yellow hazard suit, creeping up on you, guess who it is… too late! Whacked with the crowbar!<br>
Chapters: Our Benefactors<br>
Given by DOG at the end of “Follow Freeman!” (or Gordon, because DOG obviously shows you Alyx and Eli are there)<br>
Fulfilled at the end of Our Benefactors</p>
<p>Mission 7 - Showdown.<br>

<p>Mission 8 - “NOOO, ALYYYYYX!”<br>
Try to convince G-Man to save Alyx, because she’s going to die…<br>
But you fail! Damn G-Man muted you (even if you can talk during the rest of the games) so you couldn’t stand up for Alyx! She’s going to die, rest in peace.</p>
<p>Mission 9 - Wake up call!<br>
You have no idea what happened. Last thing you remember is G-Man talking to you, then something about Vortigaunts… Where the hell are you? Oh, wait, that building looks familiar…<br>
<em>Episode 1 starts</em></p>
<p>Feel free to fill in the X.1/2/3 missions for me…</p>
<p>I just love this. I blame the fact I didn’t play so long on Poison breed.</p>
<p>The first HL was genial by the fact the facility was pretty much the only real storyteller, IMHO. The second HL couldn’t afford so, but the environment still does a pretty good job at tellin the story all by itself.</p>
