    <title>Any Differences Between Opposing Force Retail Version and Steam?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-differences-between-opposing-force-retail-version-and-steam/13044</link>
    <description>I was curious since I have access to the retail version.  I realize the retail disc requires the original Half-Life to play but were there any differences between the two, even in minor details - for example, &quot;Gina&#39;s&quot; corpse in Xen or the music?</description>
