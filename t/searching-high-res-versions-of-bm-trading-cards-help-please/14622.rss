    <description>Greeting BM-Community,
I love awesome gaming wallpapers and especially steam trading cards and profile backgrounds are an awesome source for good-looking wallpapers. I have a huge folder with lots of pictures changing every few minutes.
That said, a few Black Mesa trading cards (especially the three linked below) would make awesome wallpapers, but sadly have a low resolution/bad compression. Has any Dev or user a higher quality version of these pictures that they could provide? I would really appreciate it.

The Trading cards im especially talking about, although It would be awesome, if there were high-res version of any trading card and steam profile wallpaper:

I also noticed, that two of these are actually edits of media pictures from the BM-Site. These unedited pictures have a significantly higer quality, so there could be high-res versions of the edited ones as well...?

Also if anyone is interested, an (outdated) collection of my wallpapers (most of them HL-related): [url]https://imgur.com/a/LyUpP[/url]</description>

            <p>Sorry man, I dunno how much more you can get out of those exact images. They’re already in 1080p, and the compression doesn’t seem all that bad on my end.</p>
