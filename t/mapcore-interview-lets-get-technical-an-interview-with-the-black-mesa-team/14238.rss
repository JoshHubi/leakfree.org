    <title>MapCore interview - &quot;Lets get Technical&quot;  - An interview with the Black Mesa Team</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mapcore-interview-lets-get-technical-an-interview-with-the-black-mesa-team/14238</link>
    <description>Hey guys!

So we&#39;ve been working with MapCore on this interview, and I thought that I would post it on the forums. It&#39;s got some info about some upcoming stuff that we might not have touched on too much yet, and generally just kind of cool if you&#39;re into the technical side of stuff.

You can read the interview [url=&#39;https://www.mapcore.org/articles/interviews/black-mesa-lets-get-technical-r63/&#39;]here.[/url]

Enjoy and let us know what you think!

            <p>Oh, no specifics, of course, but did you ever have a team member who just never seemed to be up to speed with <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span>? I’ve had a few of those and it’s so freakin’ annoying when they haven’t been MIA, but still are somehow unaware of even recent topics.</p>

            <p>I felt your pain regarding the SVN part. I’ve been part of student projects where people didn’t want to use SVN (or similar), and it was <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> those people who caused troubles down the line. No, Dropbox is NOT a valid alternative for code. ;_;</p>
<p>Also, those comparison shots are sweet. I just finished the Steam version yesterday, and while I did frequently stop to look at how pretty the view was (no, seriously), these comparison shots really show just how much it all improved since the mod version.</p>
<p>Overall, nice interview =3</p>

<p>Fairly intersting read and hearing what you went through in terms of problems should make every naysayer who doesn’t want to pay for the mod consider re-thinking their position. It’s admirable. I’m kinda sad to read that some of you are so burned out that you don’t want to play any part in game development any more, but I guess that’s what to be expected when everything takes a different path than imagined further into development.</p>
<p>Also cool that you talked about your communication and the team responsibilites and hierarchy (or rather lack thereof), so my planned “Interview” becomes kinda obsolete. May I ask if I’m allowed to use the interview for my studies ?</p>

<p>I don’t see why not since it’s public domain. Just make sure to credit the source to MapCore and the author, since it is their article.</p>
<p>Yea, some are burned, others are still doing stuff. A few of us (myself included) are part of other projects or companies in the industry. It’s tough, but you can learn how to get through it.</p>

<p>Working remotely with other people is not easy, I won’t sugar coat that. But it has a lot of perks.</p>
<p>Competitions and Junk are some of my specialties… But there’s more than just that.</p>
