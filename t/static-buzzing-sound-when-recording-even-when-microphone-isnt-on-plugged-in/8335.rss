    <title>Static buzzing sound when recording, even when microphone isn&#39;t on/plugged in.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/static-buzzing-sound-when-recording-even-when-microphone-isnt-on-plugged-in/8335</link>
    <description>So I get this really weird problem where all that I try to record is absolutelly drenched in static. Combined with that, the microphone isn&#39;t nearly loud enough to what it should be, so quieter sounds are almost inaudible, and using noise removal is almost completely ineffectual as it removes the sound I want to keep as well.

I can&#39;t recall the exact name of the sound card, but it&#39;s a Creative Sound Blaster, something along the lines of X-Fi Crystalizer.

The microphone I have no idea, though I figure it&#39;s probably not important as the problem persists through all such, but it&#39;s a proffesional song mic.

Following is a sample of how it sounds, I can manage to make it a little better or worse fucking about with some settings, and this is probably the best yet:

            <p>I tried using the on board plug, and the buzz is gone. The volume, however, is still low, almost inaudible if I don’t talk just a few millimeters from the mic. The quallity as also a bit odd as all bass seems to disappear.</p>
<p>I’m gonna see to it if I can put the card in a different slot later, and then report.</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I looked into it, and it seems the only other slot isn’t accesible as my graphics card is sitting right in the way, so all I managed to do was plug it out and put it back in again. Now the volume of the microphone is just as low on the sound card as on the on board, and it feels like I’ve seriously broken something, which seems almost impossible the way I’ve handled it all.</p>
<p>Another edit: I tried plugging in my old microphone again and surprisingly it works  really good now, despite having the same problems as the other one the last time I tried. There is still buzzing with it, but it doesn’t bother as the volume is still TOO good anyway and it isn’t noticable when I pull it down.</p>
<p>I’ve concluded that there must be something wrong with the microphone after all, because how could this suposedly proffesional microphone be worse than the one I bought for like 20 kronor at the low-budget home appliance store? I’m gonna try and return it for a new one, but thank you all for trying to help me, it’s much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Try plugging out the soundcard and using the onboard one instead.<br>
That will at least narrow down the problem.</p>

            <p>Move the card to another slot in the PC (if you have another of the same type available). If not, do you have access to another PC you could try the card in?</p>
<p>Also try unplugging anything else in the power strip except the PC and monitor to make sure it’s not electrical interference. If you have 2 prong plugs in your room and you’re using grounded plug adapters (assuming you’re in the US), then it’s probably a grounding issue.</p>

            <p>Tried all suggestions, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I don’t get anything with other applications or appliances, and there is nothing wrong with the microphone, as all microphones react the same, and do not in other computers. I thought I had made that clear in the opening post, but I guess I didn’t put it down very well.</p>
<p>I think I’m just gonna contact the retailer for the sound card and see if it might have been broke when I got it.</p>
<p>But if any other suggestions are welcome.</p>

            <p>I had this recently (like couple of months ago)<br>
My setup includes the Logitech G51 surround system and a realtek soundcard, the one from Gigabyte Z68X-UD7-B3 motherboard.<br>
I have some 5$ microphone I use for skype. Well in my case the buzzing would stop once I plugged out the microphone. Also the mic wasn’t loud enough.<br>
How I solved it:<br>
I went to control panel&gt;sound and enabled Line in, I made sure all the other stuff was also enabled (line in was for some reason disabled),<br>
I also enabled something called Stereo Mix ,and I reduced the sound quality (realtek control panel) from studio to dvd, everything worked OK after that -no buzzing.<br>
Also try reinstalling sound drivers.<br>
Maybe the mics cable insulation is not grounded properly (bad cable or not plugged in properly), which causes interference (buzzing)</p>

            <p>What acade365 said, check to see if other devices do this. If it turns out to just be the the mic, then, depending on how new it is, you can turn it back in for a refund and get a another, free mic, or just buy a new one and throw this one away.</p>
