    <title>Periodic Table</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/periodic-table/9596</link>
    <description>Hi, this is a _very_ minor thing but maybe it&#39;s something you want to fix nevertheless for consistency. 

The periodic tables at several walls feature the elements Darmstadtium (110 Ds) and Röntgenium (111 Rg). 
Those elements have been named only very recently in 2003 and 2004. 
Prior to this, they got the interim names Ununnilium (Uun) and Unununium (Uuu).
According to this timeline [url]https://www.members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/timeline.htm[/url], HL1 takes place in 2000. 
Not sure how correct this page is though.

P.S. The game is even surpassing my very high expectations.
Thank you, it was definitely worth the wait every single year!  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>You’re right, I missed that part on that timeline webpage.</p>
<p>OTOH, then we actually know exactly when the Black Mesa incident takes place.<br>
The calenders on different walls show December, starting with Friday 1st.<br>
Between 2000 and 2009 only the year 2000 and 2006 complies with this calendar sheet.<br>
And since 2000 is out of way (periodic table), we now know Black Mesa takes place on December 2006.</p>

            <p>Not really. That timeline is an estimate. There is never any proof that Half-Life 1 took place in the year 2000. The only proof we have is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://images.wikia.com/half-life/en/images/7/7a/Gordon_letter_PS2.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://images.wikia.com/half-life/en/images/7/7a/Gordon_letter_PS2.jpg</a></p>
<p>I remember that letter being in the game’s booklet back in 1998. The year is seen as 200- so it can be anywhere between 2000 and 2009.</p>
<p>The top of the link you posted even says it:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“The HL1 manual indicates that the Black Mesa incident occurred on May 5, 200-, implying by the “-” that the incident could take place during any year during the decade. For simplicity’s sake, I assumed it happened in the year 2000 and went from there.”</span></p>
<p>So the periodic table in the game works either way.</p>
<p>Another argument could ask why all the computers in the game use Windows 98 instead of XP. But without a specific date, anything goes.</p>
