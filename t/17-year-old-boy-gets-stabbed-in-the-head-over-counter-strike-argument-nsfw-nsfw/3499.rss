Accused Game Cheater Gets Knife Through Head and Survives
Mar 22, 2010 10:00 AM

An argument between Counter-Strike players at a Chinese net café over suspected use of a &#39;wallhack&#39; cheat led to a 17-year-old boy being stabbed through the head with a foot-long knife - and living to tell the tale. (Graphic Photo)

Counter-Strike players in the Jilin province of China take cheating extremely seriously, as evidenced by the grievous wound suffered by one suspected cheater on March 16. The 17-year-old victim was suspected of using a hack that allowed him to see through walls, giving him an obvious benefit in the computerized game of hide and go kill each other.

A fight broke out outside the net café regarding the hack, and one assailant decided to do a little hacking of his own, stabbing large knife into the side of the cheater&#39;s head, the tip of the blade barely protruding from the other side.

Speaking for everyone reading this, ouch.

The boy, miraculously still conscious, was rushed to a nearby hospital. After around 10 hours of surgery, the knife was successful removed. The boy survived, but is under observation in case bits of rust - did we mention the blade was rusty? - flaked off inside his brain.

So how does someone survive a foot-long knife through the skull? According to doctors, the blade missed major arteries, which kept him from hemorrhaging, and managed to somehow avoid affecting motor skills even though the blade passed through areas that handle those functions.

The net café where the incident occurred was popular with local youths because it didn&#39;t require ID, a fact I&#39;m sure some will consider to be a factor in the incident, but I&#39;ve always believed that being an lalalalalalala with a knife is an ageless thing.

I&#39;m not sure how the law works in China regarding stabbings, but somewhere there&#39;s a Counter-Strike player just as relieved that the victim didn&#39;t die as the victim himself.

Physician Yan Shi-jun, who operated on the young man, said that the chances of surviving such a wound were one in ten thousand. Those are pretty steep odds.

I bet he cheated.

            <p>Hey guys, if you wanna have a serious debate over the validity of gaming infecting real life, then hows about someone make that thread over in the debate area.  I have seen some great discussions on this and I wouldnt mind seeing it again.</p>
<p>But to be honest, I am not sure why I left this particular thread open and now I see it degenerated (is that a word?) into a thread to post the most disturbing examples of human depravity only to make fun of it. I just want to remind you guys that this IS serious business.  Teen angst with guns is not a laughing matter.  Lets not make it one.  (Says the gal who lives 15 minutes from Columbine)</p>
<p>Forgive me. I am closing this.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The principle is pretty simple: Computer games provide fun upon mouse-clicking. Almost every time you click the mouse, something cool is supposed to happen. You fire a gun, open a treasure chest, roam the fields of Azeroth, talk to a hot woman you’d never even dare to get too close to in real life, or solve a puzzle. All by simply pushing a button.</p>
<p>So basically, every time you push the button, your brain provides “reward” experience by giving out serotonine, dopamine or enorphine (whatever the stuff is called). The more you play games, the more you get used to “getting your shot quickly and conveniently”. It’s like drug addiction, only that the stuff you get addicted to comes from your own brain. You simply stimulate it to give it to you. Like mental masturbation, actually.</p>
<p>In time, you grow more and more unable to handle frustration, grow more and more impatient. Everything you want, you want NOW. In the instant of a moment. Everything that takes longer than a moment isn’t worth doing it, because it takes you too long to “get your shot”. Prepare a meal? Too much frickin time. If there’s no food, someone’s gotta get me something. If noone’s gonna get me something, I won’t eat. I’ve got more urgent things to do - on the screen, trying to get to my next “shot”.</p>
<p>People become unable to handle the real life, because it is more complicated and frustrating than gaming. In the real world, you have to do more than mouseclicking. And the real world doesn’t look as awesome as my favourite fantasy world. So why should I spend any more time than absolutely necessary in this “real” world? People get easily frustrated by the easiest tasks. Because they’d be much easier in a game.</p>
<p>If frustration, however, finally even dominates your favourite gaming experience, because somebody who outperforms you appears and ruins it for you, your whole world is about to collapse. The game was the best thing in your life. It was the ONLY thing in your life giving you “happiness” and “pride”, and now someone humiliates you IN THE GAME. So the game becomes reality, the place where you are NOT SOMEONE SPECIAL, not one of the best, just a sucker who is inferior to others. That should not be. That MUST NOT BE.</p>
<p>You have thrown your whole life away to master this game, and then someone comes along and beats you at it? Even a relatively stable person would have difficulty taking that kind of humiliation. A nerdy pro-gamer with no life whatsoever will obviously freak out and go postal. Or at least do something very stupid and dangerous.</p>
<p>Not hard to understand. Gaming is like doing drugs. Only the drugs come from your own body. Maybe I simplified it a bit, but that’s how I see it. If you are addicted to something, and someone forces you to go cold turkey, you’d better be a strong-minded person, cause this will fucking SUCK. And yes, you CAN go cold turkey on your own body’s “reward hormones”. I think that’s why unhappy love hurts so much. It’s going cold turkey after having been pumped to the max with “happy stuff” for a while. No wonder some people talk about “being in love” calling it “being intoxicated”. It’s true.</p>
<p>Well, at least that’s my two cents on this story.</p>

<p>I don’t agree that the situation should be mocked, however I agree 100% that the person who did this should be ridiculed and shamed.  So we are, for the most part, in agreement. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>However, you apparently have not read the thread before replying though, because then you would’ve known that that’s not what’s happening here.  People in here are mocking the victim and what happened to him.  I have hardly seen anyone mock or ridicule the person who did this yet.</p>

<p>No, it’s perfectly reasonable to mock this situation. The idiot who takes a GAME seriously enough to do something like this should be mocked, scorned, and laughed at by his fellow gamers without even the slightest shred of respect for his actions. What he has done is in no way deserving of ANY KIND of elevated status, good or bad, and anything other than complete ridicule would do just that.</p>
<p>As for the person who was stabbed, he survived what are essentially miraculous odds, and the only reasonable response to that is to downplay the severity of the situation with humor. There’s no point in being paralyzed by someone’s completely retarded actions.</p>

<p>I don’t know what’s more unnerving.  The fact that this actually happened, or the fact that some of you guys here are actually <span class="bbcode-i">making jokes about it</span>.</p>
<p>I would suggest many young gamers these days aren’t living in the real world anymore.  In their world there is no difference between a computer game and real life.  When somebody annoys you in Team Fortress 2 you stick a knife up their back, so why not do the same when someone annoys you in real life?</p>
<p>I don’t believe it’s a problem of computer games though. I think it’s a cultural problem; a problem with our society evolving and our educational system standing still.  Many children aren’t taught anymore to think for themselves, or to think about what concequences their actions have.  Yet these children do live in the real world, where their actions have real concequences.  Most of them don’t even realize this once they are hauled off to jail.</p>
<p>We don’t spend enough time educating children.  And I don’t mean educate them to have lots of knowledge, I mean educate them to be <span class="bbcode-i">smart</span>.  We live in a society where young children are confronted with an enormous amount of sexually explicit and violent material.  Therefor, we need to educate children on <span class="bbcode-i">how to deal with these influences</span>.  If we don’t, it overtakes them.</p>
<p>I think it’s extremely scary to read news like this and even more distressing to read the responses some of you post on here.</p>

<p>I guess he’s got one hell of a splitting headache<br>
Seems he didn’t make the cut.<br>
Looks like he got the point<br>
Looks like he couldn’t counter that strike<br>
Looks like he was not cut out to play fairly.<br>
guess he didn’t have sharp enough senses<br>
Looks like the assailant wasn’t too sharp<br>
Counter-strike players really are on the cutting edge.<br>
Looks like the assailant liked hacking after all<br>
I guess cheating wasn’t such a sharp idea after all.<br>
Looks like the assailant did a hack job<br>
You can say that all his dreams were shattered.<br>
I bet he wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed.<br>
Gonna take a stab in the dark and say he’s going to be alright</p>
