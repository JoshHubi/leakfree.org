    <title>Pistons in Residue Processing are extremely glitched</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pistons-in-residue-processing-are-extremely-glitched/10298</link>
    <description>Everything was going good up until the pistons. It took me well over 100 attempts to get past the pistons, 12 of them are recorded in the following youtube video.

The first set was bypassed easily, the second set, however, is extremely glitched. Whatever triggers that kill you are extremely out of sync and made it IMPOSSIBLE to pass, but the catch is, it goes out of sync over time. If you pull the level and spend a lot of time wandering around before going into the conveyor and approaching the pistons, the kill triggers go out of sync. After 100 or so failures (yes, literally), I decided to load back to the autosave. I pulled the lever and rushed through both sets, first attempt, with no problem. It only appears to be the second set that does this.

            <p>In my case, the problem I had with the first set of pistons, there was no way parssar them. I read on these forums that could be solved by loading the gaurds device, but I did not use. I loaded in a previous chapter and repeat until I return here, but I again encountered the same problem. I already gave up when I decided to try one last time: I load the saved device, activate the lever and I went straight to the piston, and this time I pass the two series with no impediments. Maybe it should be done immediately, without entertainment.</p>
<p>Sorry for my bad English. If a case take the blame Mr. Google Translate (above makes me please!). Enclosed is the original Catalan:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">En el meu cas, el problema el vaig tenir amb la primera sèrie de pistons, no hi havia forma de parssar-los. Vaig llegir en aquests fòrums que es podia solucionar carregant el gaurdat automàtic, però no em va servir. Vaig carregar en un capítol anterior i el vaig repetir fins tornar en aquest punt, però em vaig tornar a trobar amb el mateix problema. Ja em donava per vençut quan vaig decidir intentar-ho una última vegada: vaig carregar el guardat automàtic, vaig activar la palanca i vaig anar directament cap als pistons, i aquesta vegada vaig pasar les dues sèries sense cap entrebanc. Potser és que s’ha de fer de seguida, sense entretenir-se.</span></p>
