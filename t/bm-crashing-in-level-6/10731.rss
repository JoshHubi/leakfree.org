    <title>bm crashing in level 6</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-crashing-in-level-6/10731</link>
    <description>hey guys, 
first of all i want to congratulate you on this awesome project, it must have been a lot of work but the result is truely amazing! until now, i&#39;ve had a lot of fun with bm  :slight_smile:  
unfortunately, it keeps crashing in level 6 always at the same spot. it&#39;s where you have to turn on the huge fan in order to get into a small air pit. i activate the fan and it starts turning faster and faster for about 5 secs or so and then the game sends me back to windows with the notification that hl2.exe isn&#39;t responding anymore.
i use an intel i3-370M with an intel HD Graphics (pretty lame i know  :stuck_out_tongue: ). the game is installed in the proper direction and i tried it with the lowest possisble graphic settings but it keeps crashing  :frowning:  hope u can help me...

            <p>Make sure all the wooden crates and other physics objects are out of that room before you start the fan, some computers can’t handle the physics.</p>
<p>I think changing steam.inf APPID=109 might also fix this, but I am not sure.</p>
