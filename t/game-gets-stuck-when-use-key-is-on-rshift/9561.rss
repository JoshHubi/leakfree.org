    <title>Game gets stuck when Use Key is on RShift</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-gets-stuck-when-use-key-is-on-rshift/9561</link>
    <description>Hi,

after using the second &quot;manual override&quot;, with Use bound to RShift, I could not use any keys on my keyboard anymore. On any key I only heard a klicking sound and nothing else happened. Not even Ctrl + Alt + Del worked anymore at this point, so that I had to reset my computer. I was however able to use the mouse and kill myself with a grenade. After respawning i still could not use the keyboard.

After this happened the second time after reboot, I figgured this might have something to do with my key assignment. I set them to default and used the manual override, everything worked ok. I then loaded the previous savegame, switched only the use key to RShift, used the manual override and again the Game was stuck and I had to reset my computer.

I have a german keyboard layout.

PS: Though my first post is a bug report, still want to say how impressed I am by the amazing quality of this mod.</description>

            <p>I am sorry, that wasn’t a bug, that was a “feature”. After reinstalling windows 7 recently, I forgot to disable the annoying Filter Keys Feature.</p>
<p>It seems I did not hold down RShift for eight seconds while using the first valve, maybe I let go of the key for a moment an then pressed it again. This made me think the problem was something related to that second valve.</p>
<p>I am not sure if you can do something about this, this seems to be windows fault. I have disabled this piece of crap feature and am now able to use the second manual override. Case closed.</p>
