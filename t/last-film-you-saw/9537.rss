    <title>Last Film You Saw</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/last-film-you-saw/9537</link>
    <description>I saw [i]The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo[/i] (2011) last night. Surprisingly, it caught my attention more than a marathon of [i]Frasier[/i] reruns.

Given some of its raunchier scenes, holy smokes am I glad I saw it alone. But it was a riveting and enjoyable movie with a few interesting characters (okay, mostly that one titular girl). It was long, but well-paced and engaging, and the ending was tidy.

I&#39;m still not used to him being a blonde James Bond, but Daniel Craig seemed at home with this role.</description>

            <p>Not a huge Bruce Willis fan as a lot of his films are hit and miss, lets be honest here, he’s no Nic Cage.  However, I just got done watching Death Wish, the Eli Roth remake with ol Bruce.  Even though the critics hated it… this movie was from start to finish AWESOME.</p>

            <p>Some stuff to watch if you’re bored over the Holidays.<br>
“At First Light” - Despite the mediocre reviews I enjoyed it. Decent sci-fi.<br>
“Searching” - had me guessing<br>
“The Captain (Der Hauptmann)” - Germany at the end of WW2 was not all sauerkraut and schnitzel<br>
" The Domestics" - apocalyptic pR0n</p>
<p>on the tube<br>
Bodyguard<br>
The Sinner<br>
Homecoming</p>

            <p>The Shape of Water. Very much a Guillermo Del Toro  film, and possibly his best (fighting with Pan’s Labyrinth). Fantastic film ery much worth a watch, as long as some nudity and a small but potent amount of violence and gore don’t put you off.</p>

            <p>A Star is born. Can’t get enough of the soundtrack. I thought I was gonna go goo goo for gaga’s songs, but I am pleasantly surprised at Bradley Cooper’s Rock Country voice and guitar work.</p>

            <p>The Professionals - 9/10</p>
<p>1968 western with Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster, Woody Strode, and Jack Palance playing a Mexican. One of my favorite westerns ever. Unfortunately it is a mostly forgotten classic. More people need to go back and see this one.</p>

<p>Escape Plan 2: Hades is a piece of garbage. 3/10. No good acting, everyone with any talent is wasted, the fight choreography is poor, the cinematography is bad, the special effects suck (I’ve seen better in amateur YouTube videos), the editing is worthless, the story is stupid, it doesn’t even feel connected to the original movie even with the returning cast.

            <p>Solo was okay. Better than I expected at least, that Alden guy wasn’t a bad Han to be fair to him. Pacing/editing was weird and dull at times though, which sucks cos there are some great sequences/shots in there</p>

            <p>Avengers: Infinity War</p>
<p>[spoiler]Having read the actual comics on which it is based I was anxious to see whether Thanos would actually be allowed to eliminate half the life in the universe, and figured there were about 50-50 odds of that element being cut entirely.</p>
<p>I was <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> expecting that to be the end of the entire movie.</p>
<p>I’m pretty impressed.[/spoiler]</p>

            <p>Solo: A Star Wars Story</p>
<p>Not bad, but nothing special. It’s the movie that no one asked for and doesn’t really stray outside of safe.</p>

            <p>I’m rewatching Valerian. It’s a stupid movie with miscast leads with no chemistry, and a solid 30 minutes that should be excised, but it sure is beautiful to look at.</p>

            <p>I have heard that Annihilation had the opposite release strategy that it should have. Americans don’t care about most artistic movies so it should have been released on Netflix here and in theaters in Europe where they do care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>I just don’t care for most horror movies so it could be a while before I see that one.</p>

            <p>Saw <span class="bbcode-i">Annihilation</span> yesterday.<br>
To my total surprise the film went straight to netflix - at least outside of the US. It’s a bit of a shame because a film with such amazing visuals needs to be on a big screen, imo.<br>
I liked it a good deal. Garland managed to create this amazing and strange world that is the shimmer. And with it come some truly unnerving horror scenes, although I think the film could have used some more of that. The strange fauna in the shimmer also could have used some more variety as well. I think the expedition only encounters three diffrent animals, which I found a bit scarce within the otherwise seemingly lush environment.<br>
The ideas within this film reminded me a lot of Stanislav Lem’s <span class="bbcode-i">Solaris</span>, and I’m pretty sure there must have been some inspiration from his material.</p>
<p>Other than that the acting is pretty good throughout. Pretty good sci-fi that dares to be diffrent. Definitely makes me wanna read the books.<br>
Recommended!</p>

<p>Spider-Man Homecoming.</p>
<p>Really liked it. As a fan of Ultimate Marvel, it really hit that sweet spot.</p>
<p>The villain stuff was great for a change too.</p>

<p>Bowling for Columbine. Michael Moore does a decent job to explain the point of views of many people and does a great job at explaining why the Columbine incident occurred. 6/10.</p>

<p>I haven’t seen the film but I may be interested in taking a look at what the outside folk think what happened. I work 5 minutes from the school and when it happened, I knew people that had kids that went to the school. I also had a coworker was best friends with one of the killer’s mom. In short, the kids were tired of the bullying.</p>
