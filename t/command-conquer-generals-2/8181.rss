            <p>People need to make a game where China is good guy and American is bad guy.</p>
<p>Anyway, this game look great to me. Although the only C&amp;C I enjoyed is RA2.</p>

            <p>Well, America did try the isolationist approach for both World Wars, but when the rest of the world just won’t leave you be, it kinda shakes your beliefs that such a system would work.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s the hard line approach to foreign issues which screws America over.  All the great Empires ended up screwing themselves over by being huge dicks to the rest of the world.  America has been a complete and utter dick to everyone for the past 100 years, so it’s inevitable that they’ll get some backlash from it.</p>
<p>Look at the British Empire.  It ruled 1/4 of the entire world’s population at it’s peak and was seemingly invincible.  It had the military and the cash to do whatever it wanted.<br>
But because they were the biggest assholes in the world for such a long time everyone else said “FUCK YOU, we don’t want to play anymore” and that was the end of the Empire.</p>
<p>China are now going to be the biggest assholes in the world.</p>
<p>America just needs to get used to the idea that from now on they’ll be China’s bitch.  Just like how the UK is now America’s bitch.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Korea does probably have a mostly fair tax system but I was trying to make a point about tax loopholes where incredibly wealthy people send their money through someone else.<br>
Similar pay for most jobs would lower the gap between the poorer and wealthier sides of society. Creating less tension and resentment.<br>
The equal social status would mean every one has the same rights, unlike some states in the US where gay couples can’t get married.</p>
<p>That post was a joke, most of the time when I see some show from the US talking about some kind of non-extremely-capitalist thing they’re all like “herp derp don’t wanna be communist”, and how Obama is the most socialist guy in the world and how it will ruin everything if every one is a little more equal.</p>

<p>A question to you Americans.  Would you nerd rage and get seriously butt hurt if you had to play NATO / EU instead of playing as the US?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If it made sense then I wouldn’t care. Like in the canonical events of Zero Hour, the Americans all got buttraped by the GLA and retreated back to the homeland, which made for slightly amusing story (although let’s be honest, Generals never had any real story to begin with anyway).</p>
<p>So if the US doesn’t appear as a major player in Gens 2 then it would be reasonable.</p>
<p>That said, I do like when the USA is a part of the game, but I also like variety, especially since the whole “US = World Police” thing is becoming overused.</p>

            <p>To really get something like that to work, you’d have to have a very grey on grey ambiguous morality setting. Think of the two seasons of “Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex” for example. The American Empire more or less works to serve it’s own ends no matter what. First season, they help out. Second season, they hinder. Something like that.</p>
<p>Oh, and “Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker” featured Big Boss as head of a PMC fighting against mercs in the employ of “La CIA.”</p>

<p>A question to you Americans.  Would you nerd rage and get seriously butt hurt if you had to play NATO / EU instead of playing as the US?<br>
I assume this is what devs believe when they put the US in EVERY SINGLE GAME EVER even if it makes no sense for them to be there.</p>
<p>Personally I believe that Americans are somewhat more intelligent than that and wont boycott a game just because they can’t listen to some Texan accent talk about killing middle eastern people as they gun down Arabs.</p>
<p>Also, with EU being a faction I would hope to control the EUs most powerful unit.  MERKOZY. The monstrous being that is a combination of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy.  Saviours of the Euro and all round dictators of Europe.<br>
Special attacks would include being able to fire Bratwurst cannons and to cause your enemies army to go on strike.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m actually annoyed as well that Americans are included in pretty much every game ever even if they don’t fit. So yeah, I wouldn’t mind at all if games were to start including NATO or some other faction instead of America.</p>

<p>I don’t care who I play as. Although, I would prefer to play as America… Except in Axis &amp; Allies. I can NEVER win as America in that damned game! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>

            <p>A question to you Americans.  Would you nerd rage and get seriously butt hurt if you had to play NATO / EU instead of playing as the US?<br>
I assume this is what devs believe when they put the US in EVERY SINGLE GAME EVER even if it makes no sense for them to be there.</p>
<p>Personally I believe that Americans are somewhat more intelligent than that and wont boycott a game just because they can’t listen to some Texan accent talk about killing middle eastern people as they gun down Arabs.</p>
<p>Also, with EU being a faction I would hope to control the EUs most powerful unit.  MERKOZY. The monstrous being that is a combination of Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy.  Saviours of the Euro and all round dictators of Europe.<br>
Special attacks would include being able to fire Bratwurst cannons and to cause your enemies army to go on strike.</p>

<p>Surely it would be China, USA and GLA like the first one.<br>
I’d be totally up for NATO replacing USA though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>After the events of Zero Hour, the USA retreated to North America to defend the homeland. If they stay that way then I’m not sure how much of a major player they would be.</p>
<p><a href="https://i385.photobucket.com/albums/oo294/dkytehkingdu/Capture.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The tank in the trailer has “EU” painted on it</a>, which confirms the EU as a potential faction. <a href="https://i385.photobucket.com/albums/oo294/dkytehkingdu/Capture-1.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Quad cannon trucks have “GLA” painted on them</a> which confirms GLA as a faction.</p>
<p>The question is, what would the third faction be? With a Western and a Terrorist faction, the only remaining faction would be an Eastern faction. I would guess that it would logically be China because they were the canonical victors of Zero Hour.</p>
