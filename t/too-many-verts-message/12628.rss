    <title>&quot;Too many verts ...&quot; message</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/too-many-verts-message/12628</link>
    <description>By the time i wrote this, the game has crashed 3 times on totally different areas but only when i have several minutes playing it and not always. I mean, is not normal the game crash so i can&#39;t complain. 

I must say that a message appear only once, the other 2 times game has crashes there wasn&#39;t a message on the screen, the image just freeze and the sound keep on a loop. The time i get the message was the only time an &quot;mdmp&quot; file appear on the source sdk base 2007 patch and sound doesn&#39;t keep on loop. And yes, game is proper installed on Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS.

The message says:

&quot;Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (38197&gt;32768) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE&quot;

[b]EDIT:[/b] Game crash again, but now saying &quot;hl.exe has encounter an error an stop working&quot;. Second mdmp attached.

            <p>It’s not your PC, it’s a simple engine error.</p>
<p>“Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (38197&gt;32768) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE”</p>
<p>Dynamic vertex buffer is a method that the game (Source Engine) uses to render things in the world, dynamically. The vertexes are basically any world surface/entity/particle/model. “Too many verts” means that what you saw exceeded the limit for a dynamic vertex buffer. (38197&gt;32768) is the numerical reason why you got the error. The limit is 32768, a power of two. This is probably the hard-set limit for the Source Engine. You’ve exceeded your verts (38197) which is more than the limit above. The only way to fix this error is to ACTUALLY “Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE”. Ideally, something like 65536, which is a power of two.</p>
<p>I also get this problem. Whatever the BMS developers put in the game, exceed the vertex buffer size, so a programmer needs to raise it so we don’t get these errors anymore. :B</p>

            <p>It seems to be random, as i return to the same area after game crash, and it doesn’t crash again on the same place. I am on the very early stages, start the game yesterday. I only have discover 4 weapons: Two pistols (9mm and .315), grenades and the mighty crow. So, i am not very far from the begging.</p>
<p>The most important tip here is that the game only crash after several minutes of play; maybe 1 or 2 of continued hours of very good play.</p>

            <p>What chapters/maps/landmarks did this happen in (“It happens when I get to the lowest level next to the blocked door next to the tentacle monsters in Blast pit” or “it happens whenever I approach radioactive sludge” or “approach a crate”)?  Were you doing anything specific or does it seem totally random?</p>
