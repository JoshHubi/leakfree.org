    <title>Optical illusion? Are you familiar with this?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/optical-illusion-are-you-familiar-with-this/1192</link>
    <description>On at least three occasions I have witnessed a visual anomaly, most commonly after being awake for more than twenty four hours. It is somewhat short-lived, but very clear, very definitive, and seemingly too complex to have constructed in my mind. I hope to relate my observations to find this is a normal occurrence, or to find out what could cause it.

I have observed it outside on a bright and cloudy day, with glasses on, as well as under a single incandescent bulb, with concave-lensed glasses off, so it does not seem environmental. On none of the occasions did I actively feel exhausted.


The illusion is vaguely like snow. Many different iridescent points fall slightly and drift very randomly. These points resemble transparent sparks of an indefinite hue, like the shine of a soap bubble. Their linear speed does not exceed two feet per second, as they swoop gently but unpredictably.

Their movement appears wholly three-dimensional, but in the moving cloud it can be difficult to tell if parallax holds true. I get the sensation that these particles are only visible within about 4 feet. Looking around feels like normal head rotation - - they have definite positions and do not follow the motion of the eyes or retinas.


Outdoors, with dirty glasses, they were slightly less clear to the eye. Indoors, in a more confined space without concave lenses, they may have been somewhat clearer and more precisely defined. In that most recent observation, I was going to attempt to see if the particles reacted to fluid motion of the air (caused by my breath), but the sighting ceased too quickly to sample... it was only ten or fifteen seconds long. The first sighting, however, had lasted at least one minute.</description>

<p>dude,it was a joke.but as far as I can tell morphine has the same effect on me.I know because I had on time a cutting wound on my leg of 'bout 3 inches deep and the doctor put a little bit morphine in my blood to keep it clean.</p>

</aside>
<p>It isn’t - not to keep flogging a dead horse, but people refuse to stop speculating. You’re seeing white blood cells tracing paths of capillaries in your eyeball. If you observe carefully you’ll realize that the motion of the “fireflies” coincides with your pulse. Try looking up at a clear sky for a minute or so, its quite reproducible. If not, you might want to get a doctor to check for other symptoms of a detached retina.</p>
<p>As an aside, the capacity of the brain to alter visible perception in ways much more complicated than a “particle simulation” is well documented. Besides the more topical example of the brain ‘editing out’ visible veins in the eyes (except where white blood cells cause ‘gaps’), there is the example of the blind spot approximately 6 inches in front of the center of your eyes, the invisible contents of which are ‘interpolated’ by the brain to give you the illusion of a seamless field of vision. And this leaves aside the various experiences of hallucinogenic altered states in which entire alternate realities, perfectly convincing, are constructed by the mind.</p>

<p>Checking insurance for twelve hours and idling overnight in a slow chatroom come to mind :zip:</p>
<p>I didn’t believe it to be a hallucination at first, because I’ve never actually hallucinated anything outside of going into sedation. The rest of the scene was clear as normal, and the details of this effect were too… too elegant in their curves (yet erratic compared to oneanother) to have been artificially generated. I know the brain is complex, but I do not expect it to be able to run a completely foreign particle simulation.</p>
<p>I suppose it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span>, however, possible… The preceding sensory deprivation may give some credit. Despite this, I wouldn’t give hallucination any more credit than the BFEP.</p>
<p>Interesting thing about the caves, though… I wonder if that inspired art in the first place.</p>

            <p>Lack of sleep can easily cause hallucinations, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this was the case.</p>
<p>However, it would be interesting to know where you spent those 24 hours. Lack of activity or sensory input can also cause strange things to occur in your vision. People locked in dark rooms for more than 24 hours often report seeing things.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is also being used to explain cave drawings. People would enter caves for weeks at a time, before hallucinating. In an attempt to “pin them down” so to speak, they would paint them on the walls.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, an overload of input can cause this effect as well. Experiments have been performed where a test subject has put on special goggles with LEDs. The sunject closes their eyes and the LEDs are flashed in timed sequences. After a while subjects report seeing things in their vision, even with their eyes closed. The images they describe are often uncannily similar to many cave drawings.</p>
<p>Spooky, in’it?</p>

<p>First, you’ll ruin your eyes doing that too often, so watch out.</p>
<p>Second, that’s perfectly normal, considering your smushing your eye itself, as well as the blood vessels and nerve endings within.  After a while, everything goes crazy.</p>

<p>I think you may be the winner, for coming up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_field_entoptic_phenomenon" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">a solid answer</a> - - and concisely! Good work!<br>
If I ever witness this again, I will attempt to verify the dots are following fixed courses with oneanother. It does leave some question, as to why the phenomenon has been so temporary in my observation of it.<br>
The Wikipedia page for “Blue Field Entoptic Phenomenon” agrees that it’s easiest to see on plain surfaces giving off plenty of blue light. Peculiar that I’ve only noticed it under clouded skies and a single lightbulb.(And while daydreaming, maybe a little bit.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re welcome.<br>
The temporal irregularity of the entopic phenomenon in my opinion is caused by a combination of two factors - 1)situations which increase blood flow to the capilaries in the eyes, causing a concurrent increase in white blood cell count in that area over the average and therefore a greater frequency of vision artifacts, and/or 2) situations where the nervous system’s self-censorship of the visible capilaries is weakened or overridden by certain mental states such as mindfulness or ‘daydreaming’ likewise causing an increase in perceptible artifacts.</p>
