    <title>Backtracking plus autosaves = missing decals.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/backtracking-plus-autosaves-missing-decals/15122</link>
    <description>If the player transitions from one map to another, then returns to the map they had previously played, then goes back to the &quot;new&quot; map, that map will lose (almost?) all of its decals. Not overlays, mind you, just decals.

This seems to be related to the autosave-on-transition functionality, as disabling sv_autosave will prevent the issue from manifesting.</description>

            <p>I wonder if this is related to the problem I am having. I cannot load the next map at all. Every time it tries the game reverts back my last saved checkpoint.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I’ve noticed the same issue, but hadn’t pinned down a culprit. I assumed it was some obscure engine bug since some testers didn’t seem to have the issue.</p>
