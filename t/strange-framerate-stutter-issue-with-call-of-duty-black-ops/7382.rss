    <title>Strange framerate/stutter issue with Call of duty: black ops</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-framerate-stutter-issue-with-call-of-duty-black-ops/7382</link>
    <description>Hey, wondering if this is an issue with my hardware or is it due to the fact that black ops is terribly optimized for pc&#39;s due to it being an xbox port. 
Every time I load up the game (even in the menu&#39;s) I get a stutter every few seconds alongside a terrible framerate of as low as 20fps despite graphics setting or resolution.

My specs are:
Intel core 2 duo,
Nvidia GTX470 1280MB,
and 4gigs of RAM
and i&#39;m running on windows 7 ultimate 32bit

i&#39;m also going to note that I can run Crysis 2 at full with an average of 45-50fps so I highly doubt that my hardware is the problem</description>

            <p>I know that Black Ops was unplayable with a dual-core processor earlier, but I heard that they fixed it. Crysis 2 was actually a better optimized port than Black Ops, and I can; with my OC:d GTX 460 play Crysis 2 at max settings with around 40-50 FPS. Black Ops however, gives me weird FPS drops every now and then.<br>
It is probably your CPU.<br>
Oh, and if you can, use windows 7 x64, the allocated RAM is way under 3GB as you have 1,3GB of VRAM and a bunch of other stuff.<br>
The used RAM should be about 4GB-256MB-1280MB=2,5GB out of 4GB.</p>
