    <title>Loading zone not working in Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/loading-zone-not-working-in-surface-tension/13246</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played through most of the Surface Tension level, but after the fight against the ATV I got stuck. After some dicking around without finding a way to go, I looked it up on the internet and appearently there is supposed to be a loading zone just infront of the large gate that doesn&#39;t trigger for me... Is there any way to &quot;force&quot; the loading zone?

            <p>It doesn’t trigger on its own. In that location there’s a room on the left. There’s a hole in one of the windows. You go in and press the button on the wall.</p>
