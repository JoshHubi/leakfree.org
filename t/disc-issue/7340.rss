    <title>Disc issue?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/disc-issue/7340</link>
    <description>Most people don&#39;t play it anymore, but i&#39;m not most people.

I was playing a game on my Wii. I had to get a drink, so I stood up and walked. I was using a gc controller at the time and tripped over it. That second, my Wii took a nosedive and abruptly deactivated itself. When I cut it back on, the game I was playing was disabled. In a panic, I tested all of my other discs to ensure that the console could still read. Sure enough, every disc ran successfully except for the one that was being played during the time of the fall. Could the disc possibly be scrambled or something? I cannot afford another copy of that game. It&#39;s almost the same price as launched.

Thank you. All supportive answers are appreciated.</description>

<p>Sorry, I’m not a Wii owner so I can’t be sure, but it’s possible. I was just making a guess.</p>
<p>As for scratch removal, that might just do the trick as the scratches are in the transparent protective plastic layer of the disc. The data is stored on a metallic layer behind the plastic giving the disc it’s opaque shiny look.</p>

            <p>OP do you have any local electronic pawn shop type stores?  There is one in my area that has a disc scratch remover they charge like $5 and it removes pretty much any surface scratches and can even make a game playable with big ass scratches.  You could alternatively buy a scratch remover but seems unnecessary if this doesn’t happen often.</p>

            <p>I think simply changing the axis of a 360 while the disc is spinning will shatter the disc inside the drive and void the warranty.</p>

</aside>
<p>and sersoft, as for the spinning thing, I thought that the Wii used some type of rotating laser to read discs. At least that’s what I assumed after looking at the way the Wii loads discs.</p>

            <p>I´m leaning towards what sykopat said, not sure how wii works, but to give an example on xbox, you go in to your profile and delete all files related to that game, if it don´t work, just contact nintendo tech support.</p>

            <p>It’s terribly detrimental to tip over any disc drive while it is spinning.  You may have scratched the disc in concentric circles.  Small scratches you probably can’t see but when it circles the disc it can really fuck it up.</p>

            <p>I don’t know how the Wii works, but even  the consoles that you don’t install the game on, but who runs directly from the disk have to install something…settings, saves etc. These files were probably in use when your console hit the floor and have been corrupted or something causing the error. I have no idea if this is the case, I’m just guessing here, but is there perhaps a was to uninstall/reset these files? Any Wii owner should probably have a better idea.</p>

            <p>It won’t even go to the introduction screen. I figured that there was something wrong with the data. “An error occurred. Hit the eject button, remove the game disc, and consult the Wii Operations Manual” is the message that continues to reappear.</p>
