    <description>In the original Half-Life, the Marines had normal PASGT standard helmets, which went good with their uniform, and backpacks which carried their necessities. In Black Mesa, however, the developers decided to completely change the helmet, and completely remove the backpack. The new helmet looks weird, and doesn&#39;t look practical or fitting at all, and they got rid of the backpack. Sure, it was big, but if you were a marine on a mission, you probably have a lot of stuff to carry. It&#39;s just kinda off to me. And nowhere in the deepest depths of the internet can I find a mod or skin that changes the helmet or even adds a backpack,which is rather unfortunate. If I were a developer who knew how to model, I would edit the model and give the marines their old helmet and backpack.
This is just a suggestion, but I felt it needed to be addressed.![helmet_kevlar_700.jpg|504x321](upload://tVVEMybFoZ0Np7Mp3iLAfMpHiQH.jpeg)![maxresdefault.jpg|690x500](upload://oiCqtV56j5nTZGazU3uJRpDkwCl.jpeg)![hqdefault.jpg|480x360](upload://tj4kiFodMvN11rnTMwoCZOEElki.jpeg)</description>

            <p>In this iteration of Half Life their backpacks have been swapped out for temporary bases after long and intensive research found marines were 30% more effective at killing aliens  if they had a place to set their stuff rather than turtling it around on their backs for two days straight.</p>

            <p>The US Marines currently use the LWH, which is very similar to the PASGT but with some minor changes that are mostly invisible to someone who isn’t actively looking for a difference. They don’t use MICH, that’s Army stuff. (Although this is the HECU, who sports urban camo which is used by no branch of the US military, and an MP5 with a grenade launcher which is used by nobody, so you could make an argument that it doesn’t matter all that much).</p>
<p>I think you’re thinking about the large ammo pouches, which were cut because gestures kept clipping through them. The rucksack was… never addressed? I think? I’m actually not sure.</p>

            <p>IIRC the helmets used in BM are modeled to resemble the MICH line of helmets, minus the camouflage cover which a good chunk of the US Military currently uses.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the aesthetics of the PASGT helmet, but they decided to modernize the equipment the marines use in the game.</p>
<p>As for the rucksack, I think one was planned at one point, but they found that it didn’t work very well with the animation set. I could be remembering that wrong, though, it’s been a while since (I think) I read it.</p>
