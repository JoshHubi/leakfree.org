    <title>HL, OF and BS rebuilt and playable in Minecraft</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl-of-and-bs-rebuilt-and-playable-in-minecraft/13647</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working with a guy on this Minecraft map, and it&#39;s finally finished: [url]https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/maps/1549373-black-mesa-in-minecraft-with-mobs[/url]

It features HL (except Xen chapters), Opposing Force, Blue Shift and Decay fully rebuilt in Minecraft. He was the builder and texture/sound pack artist, I was the main redstoner. I think that considering it&#39;s built on Minecraft&#39;s engine, it&#39;s on par in terms of quality to our Black Mesa.

Give it a try!</description>

            <p>Yeah, I’m definitely impressed, but not really too interested in playing it for myself.</p>

            <p>This seems like a really cool project and a labour of love. However I don’t own (or have any interest in playing) Minecraft.</p>

            <p>Oh, and I forgot to mention one more thing about the map. This may not be realized during gameplay, but the places that are visited in multiple games (parts of BM Inbound, Lambda Core’s main teleportation room, Surface Tension’s dam etc.) are actually THE SAME location, properly weaved between the games. So while playing for example Opposing Force, the dam in Foxtrot Uniform is actually next to the Questionable Ethics lab from another game.</p>

            <p>Please guys, this map is getting WAY too little recognition than it deserves. Decay is already functional, so now there are 4 fully playable games built in Minecraft. I’m not bragging because it was not me who built it (I only did most of redstone) but once, my shitty map got featured on multiple big gaming sites, and also was visible on Steam news feed: <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rise-and-mine-mr-freeman-early-half-life-levels-recreated-in-minecraft/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pcgamer.com/rise-and-mine-mr-freeman-early-half-life-levels-recreated-in-minecraft/</a> (Xannot is my alternate username). This is utter shit compared to THIS thread’s work, and, so if there are any Minecraft players please at least comment on that.</p>
<p>Here’s a let’s play by someone not connected with the project: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGQC6AJ5RlE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGQC6AJ5RlE</a></p>

<p>Huh. Maybe if I could ever figure out how to use mods in Minecraft without breaking everything I’ll give it a look.</p>

<p>This map doesn’t require any mods, only the newest version and ability to put .zip file of a resource pack into a proper folder</p>
