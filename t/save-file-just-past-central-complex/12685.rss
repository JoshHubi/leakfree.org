I&#39;m at the part where i ran for Big Blue.
Then climbed up the square thingy.

Now that i&#39;m ontop i can&#39;t manage to do /ANYTHING/ on the panel.
The red marker isn&#39;t appearing.
I rammed all my keys, LMB/RMB and it shot a lucky shot and killed Big Blue.
Now i read that i need to hit the electricity pole and two walls more aswell.

Now that i can&#39;t aim for at all, how am i going to proceed?
Could anyone give me a save file from the next part?
It&#39;s at the Central Complex.
Couldn&#39;t didn&#39;t gave me any.

Please help me.
