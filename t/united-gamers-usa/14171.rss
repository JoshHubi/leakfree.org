            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for the compliments, we do indeed take performance extremely serious on all our servers &amp; pride ourselves on having the best (or very close) servers available as far as pure performance goes.</p>
<p>There are no plans to open up a server in USA at this time unfortunately, i am sorry.</p>
<p>However, things may change in the future if more people will request this, nothing is written in stone.</p>
<p>Feel free to join our Steam group <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeAreUnitedGamers" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeAreUnitedGamers</a> for future discussions &amp; general news about our servers.</p>
<p>Good luck !</p>
