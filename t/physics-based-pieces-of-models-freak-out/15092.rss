    <title>Physics-based pieces of models freak out.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physics-based-pieces-of-models-freak-out/15092</link>
    <description>Thank you very much for reading this!

I&#39;ve heard others say that the ties of the scientists freak out if you have low fps. This happens to me too, but I think it&#39;s actually got something to do with the physics-based parts of the models.
Both the scientists&#39; ties and the lower jaws of the zombie guards at first slowly start vibrating and jiggling back and forth very quickly, but after a few seconds those parts are stretched all across a remote corner of the map.

As hilarious as it is, it&#39;s very immersion-breaking

As a temporary fix, can&#39;t you add an option to disable physics-based parts of certain models that have them?

Love you~~  &lt;3</description>
