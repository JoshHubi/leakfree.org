    <title>Xen (Open Beta) - Trailer | Robert Culp</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-open-beta-trailer-robert-culp/62356</link>
    <description>It was getting near Robert Culp&#39;s birthday again and I had recently wrapped the first draft of a Half Life movie I was making, so I figured I&#39;d do something special since I appreciate the guy so much. He really did change voice acting for me personally: I think he&#39;s the best there ever was. 

Since Xen just came out in open-beta, I thought I&#39;d throw this together since it was close enough.
