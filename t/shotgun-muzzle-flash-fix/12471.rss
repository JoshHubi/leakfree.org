    <title>Shotgun Muzzle flash fix?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/shotgun-muzzle-flash-fix/12471</link>
    <description>Hello, 

Recently, I decided to to a little remaster on BMS by adding customs skins, sounds and tweaking a few scripts. This has been going pretty well so far, as I am quite familiar with both scripting and texturing from previous projects.

One thing I am absolutely stumped on though is the absence of a muzzle flash from the shotgun once you apply custom texture to it. I have spent no small portion of time trying to fix the issue with no avail.

Has anyone had any success in fixing this problem?</description>
