<p>I remember playing a multiplayer FPS game once (on PC), which had large outdoor maps with vehicles such as boats and probably land and air vehicles as well.

I vaguely remeber the name had either special operations or spec ops or something like that (not spec ops the line though). I also remeber the map I played on was a small island.<br>
