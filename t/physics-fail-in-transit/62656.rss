    <title>Physics Fail in Transit</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physics-fail-in-transit/62656</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new to this forum so I don&#39;t know if this has been reported before but in Black Mesa Inbound, while riding in the train, when I jump the train keeps moving but I don&#39;t, so I move towards the back of the train. This isn&#39;t how it ought to be and it suggests a flaw in the physics engine.

I hope this observation is helpful.</description>

            <p>Ha, yeah, I spotted this too. Gordon Freeman may have a PhD in theoretical physics from MIT but he still obeys pre-Newtonian physics.</p>

            <p>Actually that is how things work in a game like this. The original was like that too.</p>
