<p>Yeah, but that’s a personal thing…most (young) people don’t care about this anymore…we are the 2nd or 3nd generation that is born after the war and some have no connection to it, some already lost the grandparents. I don’t think it had much to do with WW2 itself rather than something else…</p>

            <p>I understand. Well, I kinda feel like your friends about it then. I have grown tired of WWII games, because there were just too many of them in the recent years. The theme has been worn out.<br>
Also, most of our history lessons in school are about WWII and its consequences for Germany. And they usually bore the shit out of pupils, while at the same time making them feel bad because their grandparents might very likely have committed one of the many Nazi crimes. Though no grandparent in Germany would ever admit it - they all have their own stories of the war, depicting them as innocent victims of a cruel regime. It just seems as if all the real Nazis have just faded away. All the NSDAP party supporters, all the Hitler youth leaders… for all I know, my own grandfather (may he rest in peace) might have killed Jews. I was told a different story, but so was every child in Germany.</p>
<p>Your teacher was maybe Austrian, and I know not how Austrians differ from us in using “Danke” and “Dankeschön”. In Germany, however, you can use both for the same thing. I hope you have not let yourself be confused too much by it.</p>

            <p>Danke and Dankeschön are the same thing. You might have pronounced it badly so it created confusion, maybe. And German gamers usually love games where they can kill Nazis. It’s called “compensating”. Because all of us would love to eradicate the past of our culture and the guilt that comes with it.</p>
<p>When playing games such as COD, no German gamer realizes for a moment that he is virtually shooting at the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of his generation. It just feels good to kill Nazis. Pretty much like it felt for Nazis to kill Jews. Sometimes it’s rather puzzling how similar Nazis and Nazi-haters have become.</p>

<p>Hmmm…kinda proves the point. Why not talking about CoD? I like to kill nazis too. We are no nazis, y’know. Sorry, but this sounds…stupid. And there is no difference between Danke and Dankeschön.

<p>But it’s not the USK Faults directly…the USK alone is a good system, very competent and accurate, but everything around it from laws over the beforementioned BPJM to our politicians is thinking the controls aren’t strict enough…especially since the elections are close many politicians are crying about “Killerspiele” and how the should be forbidden and such. But fact is: The USK-ratings have to be enforced by stores by law, so no need reject a rating. (Except maybe Games clearly against our laws (NS-Material for example)).</p>

            <p>Once we had exchange students from Radcliffe, USA, visit my hometown, and one of them thought it would be funny to greet our class with an enthusiastic “Heil Hitler”. He was chided for it by our teacher and taken to the principal, but some of the boys in class still felt so offended that they teamed up on him after school and made him regret ever having mentioned that name. I was not with them, but sometimes, in my darker moments, I wish I had been.</p>
<p>My grandparents and all people of their age that I have ever known had their personal stories of suffering to tell from the war, and all of them had to endure so much pain, fear and loss because of that war mongering Austrian pig and his Bavarian friends. Nazis today are hated in Germany just as Jews were hated in 1940. Some people I know have ernestly claimed we should reopen the concentration camps and put all our “Neo-Nazis” in there.</p>
<p>This is not a good climate for democracy. Under the guise of so-called “anti-fascist” movements, fascists have already tried to gain power in the governments of several federal counties. Good thing that people are not yet dumb enough to repeat that same old mistake. Not yet.</p>

<p>btw:wer das versteht kann deutsch</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re so wrong. The USK doesn’t censor games, developers do. And they do it prematurey these times around I’m afraid. It’s like this: If the USK rates the game a 18+, everythings fine and nothing can happen to the game i.e. nothing has to be censored. If the USK does not approve even for a 18+ rating (nazi references or other things like that), the game could come on the index, if the BPJM (Bundesprüfstelle für Jugendgefährende Medien, Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons) decides to. If that happens, the game must not be advertised or even sold openly in a store. So naturally, developers censor the game, to avoid getting on the index. But most games don’t even get to the USK, because it costs a fee to let them be rated. So they censor the shit out of their games to not have them be rated again. And I think most of the games wouldn’t have to worry about their rating, developers are just afraid. Dead Space is completly uncensored in germany.</p>
<p>So, enough about that.</p>
