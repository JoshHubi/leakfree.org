    <title>Ragdolls glitching out</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ragdolls-glitching-out/14522</link>
    <description>This has kinda been a thing since the mod release (for me at least O.o), but every time an NPC ragdolls after a death animation, it glitches out and bounces strangely. Possible cause is the limbs somehow clipping with eachother and suddenly releasing them causes them to jump like that.
Examples: The guard dying when reaching for a first aid station in Unforeseen Consequences,
The scientist who warns you about the tentacles in blast pit,
The scientist who falls down the elevator shaft in Office Complex (This one wasn&#39;t in the mod release though)

there might be more, but none come up in my head at the moment.</description>
