            <p>Eh… I’m a little weary of this.  I’d like to know what they would base those prices on.  If it’s user reviews then I think it’s a really stupid idea.  But I can’t see them doing this any other way.  For the time being I’m staying neutral just to see what they do with this, but I’m a little on the against side if I had to choose one.</p>

            <p>Why I think this Idea should not be done: 5 months ago, my Steam account was hacked. When I recovered it I found this: Banned from 5 servers, obscene images in my account AND the biggest part of my friends of my friendslist blocked me until I could explain what happened to them.</p>
<p>If this happens to me again, I won’t be able to pay for any game.</p>

            <p>^lol. There is no fucking plan how it works. It’s just an idea. And people are already like “LOL, Fuck Valve, they have no idea what they do, they are just a bunch of unexperienced people”. When I read stuff like your post, I believe that people think that Valve is just a bunch of stupid kids. There are people at Valve with over more than 20 years of experience in this industry.</p>
<p>If Valve is gonna make this, Im sure it will work. Valve listens to the community. They will do it right. Valve is not stupid.</p>

<p>Valve is not that stupid! They have lot of information and date based on players and games. They know how to handle it. (And i think they are not going to do it at all.)</p>

<p>Let me just phrase the question correctly. If, by some magic, it were literally IMPOSSIBLE to game the system; so that positive players ARE rewarded, and dicks ARE punished, and no mistakes are made as to who is who, would you support the system?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Does “dicks” include people who are legitimately bad at multiplayer? I LOVE to play l4d2, cs :s , etc. online, but I often end up with people who have FAR more time to actually get good at the game. By comparison, they might as well be playing with a rabid howler monkey as with me. And they let me know it. I’m not a greifer or running my mic constantly, I just dont play much.<br>
If this would get people docked, I definitely would not go for it.</p>

<p>Gabe calls the current pricing system a bug and wants a pay system based on how well you play with others. Will it work? Discuss</p>

<p>Not a good idea.  That is so damned exploitable in so many ways.<br>
if we actually lived in an honest society sure implement it.<br>
But no this is not an honest society.  The day in age we live in is called the internet.  I could just go in and give some trash talking jackass who t-bagged me a lot of bad ratings.  So on and so on.  Plus I wouldn’t accept this if people would rate or do it because of shitty teamwork.  Thats just bullshit.</p>
<p>I’ll give you an example Age of Conan.  That games pvp was destroyed from beggining.  But then they went in and added an anti pvp incentive.  If you kill someone whos level is lower then yours dependent on how variably lower their level was and how many times you killed them dictated how fast you were going to become criminal which then allowed others to kill you for the prize of looting money off of you.</p>
<p>That was exploitable.  Me and buddies thought it would be a good idea to prove a point and make some permanently low characters go out and smack a lot of higher level players get them to kill us then get on our high toons.  Go out and farm our exploit.  Just to prove a point.  If this comes out I Am definitely going to PROVE A POINT.</p>

            <p>Because they can?</p>
<p>They even spent 700.000 $ from the itemshop for Japan.</p>
<p>I never understand these negative comments about Valve being cash-hungry. They give great free support to their games, many free DLCs, they give mod tools to make more content for the games, but I still see people complain about them, they would be like Activision. (Not here, but on other sites.)</p>

            <p>If I remember in one of the interviews, part of this plan is already in action.<br>
The people who made the items in the Polycount TF2 Update, they’ve been paid about $400,000.<br>
That means to them, the cost of TF2 is a bit less than $-400,000.<br>
That’s one way of ‘reducing’ the cost to those who contribute.</p>
