    <title>Headcrab Zombies...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/headcrab-zombies/8342</link>
    <description>I was reading through the original Prima Guide for Half-Life and I noticed something rather interesting.  It seems that the zombie is called a &quot;Mawman&quot;.  I googled this thinking that &quot;Mawman&quot; meant another word for a zombie.  But the results only showed the Half-Life Gonarch and the Zombie.  Can anyone clarify where this name came from?  Was it a nickname given by Prima?  Did Valve originally intend for the zombies to be called a Mawman?</description>

<p>Took me a while to get that. Regardless though everyone DOES think lowly of his followers.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Ontopic: The Vorts in HL1 were simply known commonly as alien slaves. The fact one of their entity names is monstervortigaunt or something goes to show Valve had their name sorted since creation.</p>
<p>I imagine the fact their other entity name is alienslave was simply for programming and making the game, as it is much simpler to remember and type.</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe it´s because of the story…originally they were always vortigaunts, before Xen was enslaved… slaves had no names, their race was unknown (and not necessary to know), they were just “slaves” …when Freeman freed the Xen, their race was known again. …just a theory  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Interesting…  So would most of the terms be considered outdated?</p>
<p>I’ve never heard the term “Xen Master” used.  But I think it sounds a lot cooler than “Alien Controller”.  They’re pretty much slaves of the Nihilanth as the Vortigaunts are.</p>
<p>And I believe I read some place that Valve’s original intent was for the Vortigaunts to be officially called “Alien Slaves”.  But I think “Vortigaunt” was a nickname for them.  But obviously one was preferred much more over the other.</p>

            <p>I imagine hearing it shouted in major panic with hundreds running at you would make it seem less strange and much more terror inducing.</p>

            <p>They’re called mawmen because they’re less like zombies, and more like ghoulish men with maws.<br>
It’s just a cool nickname that nobody ever uses.<br>
I don’t know how official the term is, but I personally prefer it over “zombie”</p>
<p>The ultimate faggot test: Does this person <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> care about some dumb nickname enough to worry about it’s official canonocity?</p>
