<p>Exactly that is my biggest doubt about BMDM… Without perfect jumping- and movement- behaviour BMDM won’t be the same… I doubt i’d like to play a HL remake with noob console-style combat. Imo HLDM is all about dodging and tricking… also about spawnkilling and controlling the maps most important items and spots… and it’s much more exciting with bhop.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yeah couldn’t agree more with what has been said.</p>
<ul>
<li>normal jump to be enough units high to get on the small crates like in hl1. and Longjump to get on the bigger normal crates.<br>
although these are just measurements the feel is important.</li>
<li>Bunnyhop, oh where to go about that one.<br>
in my opinion it is easy.</li>
</ul>
<p>the casual players and steam are used to no bunnyhop.<br>
within the idea to keep the learning curve simple.<br>
this makes it easier over a mass for people to enjoy your game.<br>
but where is the challenge? <span class="bbcode-i">(most companies today forget about this, stone old games was all about the challenge)</span></p>
<p>Then theres the many players that showed love &amp; dedication to this age old game.<br>
players that are still playing today who love bunnyhop for skill, the feel of movement half-life is all about.</p>
<p>The Answer, do both.<br>
allow when creating a multiplayer server to enable/disable bunnyhoping.<br>
show the server adjustable settings to the clients as they enter.<br>
if this doesn’t appeal to you, there is another way to do both.<br>
simply allow a different gamemode that is for more adrenaline, more action.</p>
<p>with this alone you would merge people under the black mesa roof.<br>
you would have both remake sensations and not split like it is today under hl1.<br>
if you want to see where you can get a good source engine bunnyhop I would advice you on that aspect alone to take a look here: <a href="https://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Adrenaline Gamer 2</a></p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Just wanted to inform you guys that there are quite many active HLDM players out there waiting exitedly for the MP part of Black Mesa. They actually don’t play the default HL 1, but a modification called “Adrenaline Gamer”, which is almost the same as HLDM. It just got nice extra features, like a voting system for mapchange, starting the match, changing gamemod etc. However, there is still a league going on with 14 clans participating. The majority of those players are thinking of continueing their playing in BM rather than in AG, but of course they got some prospect of the mod. E.g.: Strafe Jump.</p>
<p>My first question is: Will it be possible to strafejump, which means that if you are doing a “perfect 90 degrees strafe jump” you’ll jump further than doing it normal (if anyone wants a more accurate description, just PM me)</p>
<p>Secondly, I’ve heard bhop won’t be enabled. Ok, I can understand that the majority of casual players doesnt want to have that feature enabled by several reasons (e.g.laziness of practising). But as far as my opinion is concerned (and I am sure I’m talking for the majority of active HL players) there should be at least a gamemod, where bhop is enabled. I think that wont be hard to achieve and would solve all those discussions about bunnyhopping.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>I really hope that a singlejump will be high enough to get on 32x32x32 crates and Longjump will “feel” the same as in the original Half-Life.</li>
</ol>
