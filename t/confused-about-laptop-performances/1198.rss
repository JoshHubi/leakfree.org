    <title>Confused about laptop performances</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/confused-about-laptop-performances/1198</link>
    <description>hey i recently got this 

[url]https://www.engadget.com/2009/03/10/msi-announces-the-vx600-15-4-inch-notebook/[/url]
[the 3 gb ram edition]

and i am really confused about it&#39;s performance, some people have been telling me i&#39;m supposed to run prototype in high , crysys in med-high n shit , but i finished prototype in low settings , crysys in very low settings , and even COD4 moves laggy , i got ultimate vista x86 [ like x32 or something ] on it , does it run slower then it should? , the games i install autoset themselves in very high settings , but they run very laggy if i don&#39;t tweak it , also , asssasins creed works laggy in med settings with alot of things disabled , hl2ep2 works 30-20 fps with everything on high 
[fallout 3 was laggy too , sometimes , in some settings , but the settiings didn&#39;t matter much , devil may cry 4 works in 50-60 fps only in very low settings , stalker works good in mid-low , crimes of war in low-med combination ]
does it work slower then it should?

also , is ATI3410 HD a good card? [512]</description>

            <p>Anyway to clarify it’s most certainly the graphics card, the pentium dual core is a core 2 duo with less l2 cache so there’s no performance loss in games, but that graphics card pretty much sucks, you should have got a laptop with a HD4xxx series card or a nvidia 8xxx</p>

            <p>Assassins creed it a pretty intense game, your processor probably has quite a lot to do with it, but it’s also a poorly optimized game. I was trying to run it on my old 8600 (in a laptop actually), and it went on low-mid settings, and that was when the card and the game were fairly new.</p>

            <p>Well my laptop runs Episode 2 at medium to high, no AA, at the same frame rate, 20-30. In closed areas, it can jump to 40.<br>
I can’t say I’ve tried any of the other mentioned games tho. It’s a fairly similar graphics card, cpu and ram.</p>

            <p>you could always try a program called mobility modder, it lets you use the desktop ATI drivers on laptop cards. I was skeptical at first, but there don’t seem to be any detrimental effects, gives a few extra frames in some situations.</p>
<p>But that’s only a small thing, can’t boost your performance as much as you want.<br>
