    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-can-i-replace-the-current-shotgun-sounds-with-the-hl2-ones/14527</link>
    <description>I love the new shotgun model, but i still don&#39;t like the shotgun sounds, neither did i like the ones in HL1.
So how do i replace the current shotgun sounds with the ones from HL2?

            <p>That last tip worked!<br>
Thx man, i’ll be happy blasting the shit out of everything that has a beat with this modified weapon!</p>
<p>Ouh, and by “super crazy” you mean that “that” way of modding the game isn’t safe?</p>

            <p>ok if u want to go super crazy subscribe to a mod on the workshop which replaces the shotgun sounds. Then find the .vpk file which belongs to that mod in the addons folder. Then name my .vpk to the same name as that .vpk and replace mine with that. And dont forget to restart your game if it doesnt work.</p>

            <p>Hmm.<br>
Now i have the folders, and i added Gun Nut ammunition box to the workshop.<br>
Now when i copied your .vpk file inside and start the game, the sound did not change.<br>
After i quit the game, i checked the folder, your .vpk was deleted.</p>

            <p>trying making an addons folder yourself, inside that a “workshop” folder. Maybe that will work.</p>
<p>I think the new publishing tool also has a new system for workshop content, maybe thats why you dont get the addons folder? I dont know.</p>

            <p>okay. I found a way to manually replace the shotgun sounds.</p>
<p>Add the .vpk which you can find as an attachment to this post to the following folder:</p>
<p>Black Mesa -&gt; bms -&gt; addons -&gt; workshop -&gt; HERE</p>
<p>When you are ingame it may not work immediately, try restarting the game if it doesnt work.</p>
<p>For the name of that file I just chose a name of another vpk which was in that folder which replaced the shotgun sound, I dont know if the name is important.<br>

<p>For some reason my “mod” doesnt work. I tried lots of things, maybe the new tools are broken?</p>

<p>Thank you soo much! Finally someone gets it.<br>
The problem with the old sound is that it doesn’t fit the BM anymore.Back when it started the mod was more focused to be like the old game,<br>
now they are making the game more like a brand new experience.So the old sound for me has got to go.<br>
To bring back the old new sound, lol.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I asked this exact same question in the steam discussions. I am currently trying to make a mod and upload it to the workshop which does exactly this, but for some reason it doesn`t work.<br>
When I get it to work I will post a link to the submission here.</p>
