    <title>Is the Borderlands DLC worth it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-the-borderlands-dlc-worth-it/5150</link>
    <description>For those that don&#39;t know, Borderlands is $10 on Steam right now, and the DLC packs are $3 each. It&#39;s a good price for the DLC in any case but I&#39;m just wondering if the DLC is worthwhile or not. 

So my questions really are:

Are the Borderlands DLC packs any good? Are they worth it at full price? Are they worth it at this price?</description>

<p>I only liked the 3rd dlc, general knox’s armory. Raises level cap, new vehicles, guns, and has the most new quests from the dlcs, tough they all take place after the main storyline.</p>
<p>If you are into zombie games, then Ned’s zombie dlc is decent sized and quality as well. Personally I hated it tough, horror theme doesn’t work with Borderlands’ dark cartoony humor.</p>
<p>Mad Moxy’s ain’t worth it. Just a couple of arenas and that’s it. Only get it if it’s in a bundle.</p>

</aside>
<p>basically ^this</p>
<p>Mad Moxy’s is only worth it if you have friends to play with, there’s no EXP, and the enemies are always at a level around yours</p>
<p>Zombie Island and Secret Armory were both really fun, basically if you liked borderlands, yes to those two</p>
