    <title>SDK on Mac now, Black Mesa in future, too?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sdk-on-mac-now-black-mesa-in-future-too/12792</link>
    <description>As the title says I found out Source SDK Base 2006, 2007 and 2013 Singleplayer all are now aviable on Mac so I wanted to ask if BM now will be released for Mac, too.
At the moment i have to turn off my MacBook and change the hdd every time I want to play BM, that&#39;s no long-time solution in my opinion...</description>

            <p>they’ve said they won’t do a mac or linux port but will make the source code available so the community can do it<br>
although i think that was before the steam announcement so i guess it’s all up in the air</p>

            <p>Last time I asked this question, one of the moderators deleted my post and threatened me, because he didn’t read my question I guess. I asked if there would be a mac version, now that the SDK is out, and I don’t know if he didn’t read it, or just doesn’t like macs, or what. The Dev’s haven’t said anything about the mac version, they are probably working on the steam version now. I think they should make the steam version mac and linux exclusive just to annoy the substantial amount of haters on this forum  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
and then they should make the windows version just before the fan’s heads explode.</p>

</aside>
<p>Your Opinion is wrong at worst and grossly misinformed at best. It using the source engine makes it a source game. that is what a source game is. source games don’t use the UT3 or Cry2 engine, they use the source engine. The fact that valve pushed this engine upgrade on the dev team, combined with the push into nerdix and the announcement of steamOS and the steambox makes my speculation highly probable</p>

<p>well black mesa isn’t a valve game, Crowbar Collective is thier own development team, not related to valve.</p>
<p>and they only went to that special engine to sell the game, because they needed a commercial licence to sell it</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It isn’t a Valve game, but it is a Source Game. And valve has repeatedly stated it’s push for releases of source games over all three supported PC operating systems. They could sell the game as is using the same old engine as a microshaft exclusive. There would be no reason to force a switch unless the engine had specific qualities that valve wants on release. Since all the code for BM is M-shaft specific, it would make sense to do an engine switch if it would add those capabilities under the unix-esque OS’s</p>

            <p>IIRC, they’ve confirmed opensourcing their code, and that the community will be able to ports to Linux/mac.</p>

            <p>The Dev Team have internally ported BM to the 2013 version of source, which will support Mac and Linux.  But they have stated that they don’t plan to create a Mac or Linux version of Black Mesa.  In order to get a Mac/Linux version, I think they would have to release the source code so that community members could port and recompile it.  The Devs have said they want to open-source some of their assets, but haven’t revealed which.</p>
<p>The retail version, on the other hand, is still pretty under-wraps.  I don’t think they’ve said at all whether it will support platforms beside Windows.</p>
