    <title>Jumping height issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/jumping-height-issue/10659</link>
    <description>This is my first time playing Half Life so I am not familiar with the story or the mechanics. I saw the message about getting the in-game info for where you found the glitch but it takes a while to load on my computer so hopefully you can work it out. 

[b]ISSUE[/b]: I am unable to gain the correct height when jumping. I am stuck in an area somewhat close to the beginning just before you travel down the lift and get mobbed by head-crabs. You jump onto two boxes and crawl into the vent to access the security room. Problem is I cannot make the first box. 

Hopefully it&#39;s just rookie error. I&#39;m not sure if I need more suit power? I tried using other objects (barrels) to bridge the gap or getting a quick run up but to no great effect. Sorry if someone else has already discussed this, I did have a brief look but couldn&#39;t see anything relating to it.

---
Also, if any one working on this game reads this - a big thank you to all your hard work. It looks amazing and I am very happy to finally play this game in such an atmospheric and detailed way. Kudos.</description>

<p>Also, in BM it seems you have to crouch-jump almost <em>everything</em>. It’s kind of ridiculous. I think gordon’s normal jump height should be increased, and the crouch-jump only used for maybe 10% of the required manouvers.</p>

<p>I think devs should make real testings to make the jumphight as close to what it was like in GoldSrc HL1.</p>

<p>You’re 100% right. Sorry about the misleading topic. I had tried that move after hearing about it but crouched then jumped so I kind of just hopped instead. I think that could have been explained better, or perhaps I missed the message on screen.</p>

<p>IMO it’s something that had been lost with the removal of the “Hazard course” that had been used as a tutorial in the original game. There you had to pass through the set of obstacles on your way with an audio guide telling you how to use your controls. You could check what it were like here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhricSYjcYU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhricSYjcYU</a></p>
<p>In BM there’s no such course and thus newcomers who hadn’t played original HL and its wonderful expansions before seems to be left a bit in the dark concerning this important in-game mechanics.</p>

            <p>I don’t know exactly where you are in the level, but you probably just need to crouch jump, meaning that you have to press the duck button while being airborne, so directly after pressing the jump button. This is the usual procedure in Black Mesa as well as in many situations in the original game, so no bug!</p>
