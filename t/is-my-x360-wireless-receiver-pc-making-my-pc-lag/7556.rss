    <title>Is my X360 wireless receiver (PC) making my PC lag?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-my-x360-wireless-receiver-pc-making-my-pc-lag/7556</link>
    <description>I recently bought a X360 wireless controller receiver for the PC, where it connects via USB and allows a X360 controller to be used on PC games.  I tried it out on Wings of Prey, on the lowest settings where it used to play quite smoothly, but now it lags like crazy while using the receiver.  It&#39;s noticeably less when trying it out on Super Meat Boy, where it&#39;s not as noticeable, but there&#39;s an unmistakable delay that does matter, because it&#39;s messing up my jumps.

I really wanted to try this out; any ideas on why it&#39;s lagging, and how I can fix it?

Shit, wrong thread.  Sorry.</description>

            <p>Go to Microsoft’s web site and download the driver package for it.  That’s what I had to do.</p>
