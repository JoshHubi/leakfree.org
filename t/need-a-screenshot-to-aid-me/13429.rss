    <description>Remember that part in Inbound when the tram descends, turns and continues on the rail? Well if you noclip out of the tram and look up at the top of the elevator you can see a fort-like wall. I need that wall as a base for a project, but stupid Bms keeps uninstalling itself from Steam. Could any of you guys provide a screenshot for me?</description>
