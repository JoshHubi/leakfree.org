    <title>Do you think that Valve should give the BMS Devs Jobs?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/do-you-think-that-valve-should-give-the-bms-devs-jobs/4336</link>
    <description>I sure do. after reviewing the home page for the umpteenth time, i can honestly say that this game looks better than the original Half-Life. Now of course this isn&#39;t a substitute for the original Half-Life, but damn i really want to play this.  

What im trying to get at is that the BMS team should really be hired by a game company, and get paid for their games, rather than just making free mods

EDIT: Can a mod please fix the title  :smiley:</description>

            <p>See there is nothing really wrong with this thread except:</p>
<ol>
<li>The question was “should valve hire BM devs” and the answer is “yes”. There is really nothing to discuss beyond that.</li>
<li>Everyone seems to be aware of number 1 except for the OP?</li>
</ol>
<p>What no one realizes tho is that the whole black mesa dev team is already working for valve on the episode 3 game.  black mesa is ded. everyone go home.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Closing thread now that OP is sufficiently crispy.</p>

<p>Kindergarten (grade 0) generally begins when you’re 5 years old.  9th grade would generally be 14 years old.  9 years old would generally be 4th grade.</p>
<p>And anyone not out of school yet are immature little shits who don’t know the real world yet. :3</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m guessing 9th grade is the 9th year of school (excluding kindergarten), so that would be the third year of high school (derde middelbaar), i.e. 14 years old, which seems to be the case.<br>
Of course, I’m just guessing.</p>
<p>Also, I just realized I’ve never been properly flamed on the BM forums. GIVE ME ALL YOU’VE GOT BITCHES</p>

<p>Using more than one question mark indicates a lack of maturity. Spelling errors indicate fast typing, or having English as a second language, this either indicates that this person rushes in such tasks, or does not understand the basic concept of grammar.
