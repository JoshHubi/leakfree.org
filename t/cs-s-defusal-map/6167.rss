    <description>![](upload://4Fya24PblpoMJbQNNeIIGHu6JOp.jpeg)

I have been trying to get back into Hammer again, so I gave a go at mapping for CSS. I haven&#39;t done much, the whole map is done out with dev textures and I have made a start on the terrorist spawn. I would appreciate some feedback at this early stage, as I don&#39;t want to be making the same mistakes the whole way through the design. This area isn&#39;t final by the way, I have done little work on getting the lighting right, I haven&#39;t added the props, and the buildings that will be visible in the distance aren&#39;t done yet. This is a good representation of the style I am going for though, so it would be good if some people here would help me out.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>I spent most of my time looking at Italy for inspiration, and stuck with Italy or Italy-like textures and models to keep the theme consistant. I have changed the lighting a bit, to make it look less dull and am working on detailing at the minute. I still really don’t know where to go with this though.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. I said in the post I hadn’t added any props yet, I am focusing on getting the architecture right. I haven’t added the skybox, I am not going to until I finish the rest of the map. The lighting is still being worked on, this just a placeholder so I could get some feedback. The windows are props.</p>
<p>I know it looks bland and generic, I am a little lost at how to make it look interesting.</p>
