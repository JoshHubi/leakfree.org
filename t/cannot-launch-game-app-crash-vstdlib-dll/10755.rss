    <title>★ Cannot Launch Game - App Crash vstdlib.dll ★</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cannot-launch-game-app-crash-vstdlib-dll/10755</link>
    <description>Can&#39;t seem to figure this out. Upon launching the game, I see the menu background with &quot;Loading...&quot; in the bottom right corner for a second or two, then screen goes black, then back on, repeating for a few cycles until hl2.exe crashes with vstdlib.dll at fault. 

System Specs:
1090t OCed at 4GHz w/ NB @3Ghz - cooled with H100
M4A89GTD Pro
Reference Sapphire 6950 crossfired with Sapphire FLeX 6950 (both shader unlocked to 6970 but no OC)
Creative Soundblaster X-fi Titanium HD soundcard
Corsair TX750w psu
Steam (and Black Mesa of course) are on a Corsair Force GT 120GB.
OS is on a separate Corsair Force GT 120GB. 
Also using a WD Caviar Black 1TB and OCZ Vertex 2 60GB as storage drives.
RAM is Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz (3x 4GB modules = 12GB )

To answer a few questions that are sure to be asked:
I did not touch the zip, and installed the game from the setup.exe. 
Yes I installed the Source SDK Base 2007.
Yes I restarted steam and the PC a few times.
Using 3 monitors and crossfire, I have tried all combinations of (crossfire on and off with both single monitor and multiple monitors enabled). 
I have tried using both stable steam and steam beta.
I have added the entire steam folder to the blacklist in MSE.
My GPU drivers are all up to date.
I have tried running the Source SDK Base 2007 on it&#39;s own and I get the same issue with black flashing, but it does not end, and I have to force close it.

I really can&#39;t think of anything else to try. Hopefully someone can help me, as I would love to give this game a try!</description>

            <p>Sorry to hear you are having issues. Try re-downloading Black Mesa from another mirror, maybe you download is incomplete, also please do the following:</p>
<pre><code>    Right-click on the game (being Half Life 2 and Source 2007 SDK) and select "Properties"
    Click on the "Local Files" tab
    Click on the "Verify Integrity of Game Cache" button.
</code></pre>
<p>Please let me know what the results are.</p>
