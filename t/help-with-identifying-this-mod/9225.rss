    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-identifying-this-mod/9225</link>
    <description>Hey guys it&#39;s me again!  I started Half Life and found my HUD and weapons were changed along with character models.  I really liked it but I don&#39;t remember downloading this mod at all.  I did a stupid thing and installed the HD pack over it and completely replaced those textures.  I will upload 2 pictures, I know they are not much but any info you can give would be greatly appreciated.  I noticed the M4 was named &quot;M4/M203&quot; and all the guns were much bigger and had better sounds when they fired, plus new animations for reloading.

            <p>If you haven’t already located it, HIT’s model depot is <a href="https://www.hitmodel.half-lifecreations.com/filedb/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> You can find various HD weapons (Vanilla, Gearbox, and ones that don’t really belong in HL canon) as well as DiamonD’s packs.<br>
The scientist you posted in the OP is Ambient.Impact’s. I personally recommend using his NPCs, then supplementing them with Romka’s HEV, osprey grunts and assassins, etc. (Found on Ambient.Impact’s site)</p>
<p>Really, most custom H/SD NPC models are based of AI and Romka’s work, just with minor mesh changes and retextures.</p>

            <p>Thanks to those that actually tried to help, those other mods I don’t recognize the weapons models.  With a bit of browsing, I was able to find the weapon model that looks like the one I used, I also recognized it when he pulled back the receiving handle to reload which is in one of the attached pictures.<br>

            <p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: Search for <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life: Enhanced</span>.</p>
<p>The H.I.T. Forum community is responsible for that model content and much like it (search through <a href="https://hl-improvement.com/forums/index.php?board=3.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this section of the forum</a>), with a lot of the better content made by Romka and Ambient.Impact.</p>
<p>There’s also an unreleased mod in the works which has been in progress since long before Half-Life 2 was announced. It’s not dead. It’s not getting daily attention, but it’s not dead. These guys are the hardcore Half-Lifers. If they were to rule the kingdom of “Longdevelopmentcycle”, <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span> would be but a peasant. My experience forum-going there is certainly the reason I’m so divinely patient for <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span> to come.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span> Oh shit, it seems that the entire file-system on that forum is down now. You’ll find the origins of the things you’re looking for, but you’re S.O.L. when it comes to downloading most of them.</p>
<p>I think Ambient.Impact and Romka have (or had) their own websites where they re-hosted content. Try searching down that avenue.</p>

<p>Diamond D just gathered these things and put them in packs. With the forum file-system down, hopefully those packs are still intact somewhere.</p>
