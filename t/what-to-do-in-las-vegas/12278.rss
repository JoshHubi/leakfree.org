    <title>What to do in Las Vegas</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-to-do-in-las-vegas/12278</link>
    <description>So I got wrangled into taking a road trip to Las Vegas and spending a week there. I have little clue as to what to do there, aside from gambling, which I ain&#39;t gonna do. Anyone have any first hand experience about what stuff in Las Vegas is cool and what I should skip? I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s some interesting museums and the Hoover Dam to go to, but other than that I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m gonna do all week.</description>

            <p>Oh yeah, the Imperial Palace also has a car exhibit, where all of the cars can actually be bought, if you want to shell out the money. It was fun to look through all of the 1/4 million dollar automobiles (and some 3/4 million), and wish that I could afford them.</p>

            <p>My brother made out with a woman at The Rock House in front of the Imperial Palace (which I called Imperial Plaza a few minutes ago…)</p>
<p>The Venetian has a large poker room with a lot of different types of poker being played. It is also a really beautiful hotel. There was a nice bakery open late too. I had a tasty doughnut there.</p>
<p>The Mirage has a volcano eruption every hour or so out front, but it’s not that impressive.</p>
<p>Across the street, just north of the Outback Steakhouse, there is a small casino with cheap craps tables.</p>
<p>All the downtown casinos (Freemont Street) have cheap table games.</p>
<p>Stay out of the Golden Gate hotel. I have heard bad things about the sanitary conditions there.</p>

<p>On a more serious note, you might wanna try the rollercoaster at New York, New York. There’s also a restaurant there that serves really, really good pizza.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is a very fun coaster indeed.</p>
<p>New York New York has a few good places to eat.</p>
<p>The Imperial Plaza has a cheap but good buffet on the second floor (it’s up a nearly hidden escalator and around a corner, but ask directions and you will find it). They are across the street from Caesars.</p>
<p>The Flamingo has back massage girls walking the casino floor. It was $2 a minute last I was there, and fuck me sideways if it wasn’t worth every dollar for 40 minutes.</p>
<p>I was going to suggest a place next to The Flamingo for a great sit-in breakfast, but they apparently aren’t there anymore… Same for the breakfast at Binions that was excellent, but disappeared last I was there.</p>
<p>MGM has a lion cage. I don’t know when the lions are typically awake though.</p>

            <p>Caesars is a nice hotel, but avoid the poker room.<br>
Harrahs has cheap poker tournaments every few hours all day long.<br>
I think the Golden Nugget poker room shorted me some money when I bought in the last time I was there…</p>
<p>__</p>
<p>Go to Freemont Street. They have a lot of little sideshow acts all day/night long. It’s a fun place to be. The light show at night is entertaining as well.<br>
the Bellagio fountain show is also entertaining. It runs every 30 minutes with about five or six different songs they cycle through.</p>

            <p>So I got wrangled into taking a road trip to Las Vegas and spending a week there. I have little clue as to what to do there, aside from gambling, which I ain’t gonna do. Anyone have any first hand experience about what stuff in Las Vegas is cool and what I should skip? I’ve heard there’s some interesting museums and the Hoover Dam to go to, but other than that I don’t really know what I’m gonna do all week.</p>
