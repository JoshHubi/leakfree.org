    <title>Steam refusing debit card.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-refusing-debit-card/7814</link>
    <description>So yeah Hi guys, was wandering if you could maybe shed some light here... i tried purchasing Dead island earlier today using my visa debit card, all the details are correct as i have made purchases this way before with no problems and steam saves the details, only this time as i go to purchase the game, It stops every time to inform me that my credit card company is refusing my card details, and that funds may be put on hold but i will not be charged. 

I&#39;m hoping to get this resolved fairly soon as Dead island is currently on sale for £30, and I&#39;m not sure how long that&#39;s going to last. 

I have the sufficient funds on my card, and the money on my account is available as I drew £20 from a cash point earlier today.  so guys any ideas?</description>

<p>Christ, where the hell sells it for £40?! I’d have to try hard to find it that expensive.</p>

<p>You made it sound as if the £30 for dead island was a limited time cheap offer. Made me chuckle.</p>
<p>Personally I’m waiting for it to get cheaper. And maybe patched/DLC’d</p>

</aside>
<p>Well it’s cheaper than paying £40 for it, so yeah i’d rather have the 25% off thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  I’m not sure how long it will be this way it’s still on steams specials. But The games definitely very decent so I recommend It if you haven’t tried it yet.</p>

            <p>I know this has been resolved, but eh.</p>
<p>It could have been a security/anti-fraud check that blocked the transaction. What your bank is supposed to do if this happens is give you a call to check if it is actually you trying to make these purchases. Of course this doesn’t always happen so they do leave you to do all the legwork I admit. It even just have been the CVV was put down incorrectly. I know that every now and again my details get mullered. Always best to double check (even though I know you probably did a few times already…)</p>
<p>They might ask you a couple of quick questions about what the payment is for, but after this you’re good to go (in theory).</p>
<p>I still don’t quite understand why its triggered by payments you make quite regularly, but yes it can happen.</p>

            <p>Glad you got it sorted!</p>
<p>I usually use my Debit card on steam, but I have had a few problems with it when trying to purchase on steam. I also called the Bank, but (unlike your case) they usually say its nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>I just kept trying different things until it worked, it seems the purchase info details are really sensitive against things like telephone number. I stopped using my BT line ages ago by canceling it. When it asked for phone number, I used my mobile, it didnt like it until I used my old land line number - never even thought about informing the bank!</p>
<p>Usually you can get away with small details, as long as main card details and post code of address match! - from my experience anyway!</p>

            <p>If you’re in a different country than your billing address, Steam won’t let you buy anything. However, you must trick it by changing the country in your billing address to the one you’re in. It checks your IP to determine your current country, which isn’t necessarily the same as your billing address… Why should it be the same anyway? It’s good to know this for future reference even if it doesn’t apply here  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Perhaps your debit card is insulted that you’re spending it on a derivative piece of crap.  Try buying a good game instead.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I’ve thought about that, however upon some quick googling i discovered that everybody that had come across this problem that had contacted their bank was informed that all is well, and that it was steam that was the culprit. Something about their fraud system. It’s a pain in the ass but i guess if it comes to it i’ll have to contact the company.</p>

            <p>So yeah Hi guys, was wandering if you could maybe shed some light here… i tried purchasing Dead island earlier today using my visa debit card, all the details are correct as i have made purchases this way before with no problems and steam saves the details, only this time as i go to purchase the game, It stops every time to inform me that my credit card company is refusing my card details, and that funds may be put on hold but i will not be charged.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to get this resolved fairly soon as Dead island is currently on sale for £30, and I’m not sure how long that’s going to last.</p>
<p>I have the sufficient funds on my card, and the money on my account is available as I drew £20 from a cash point earlier today.  so guys any ideas?</p>
