    <title>Low FPS</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/low-fps/10816</link>
    <description>I have huge fps drop at the moment when I first met woman assassin, right when I enter some kind of open hangar. I&#39;ve lowered all graphic options and turned of all unnecessary programs. And still fraps shows ~5 fps. The whole game was running smooth on high def until that moment. I&#39;ve checked and I pass all the recommended system requirements.

Ok.... I have no idea how this happend, but somehow after I killed 2 assassins and then pulled the lever upstairs everything started to run smooth...

So now I have tha same problem in teleportation chamber. I can&#39;t do nothing because I have fps ~5.</description>

            <p>Same issue pretty much right after the assassin kill the cop.  Also gets low at other parts of the game but not nearly as bad as this point.</p>
<p>My setup:</p>
<p>Intel Q9450 3.0Ghz<br>
Nvidia GTX 460 1gb<br>
4gb DDR2<br>
Installed on a OCZ 120gb SSD.</p>
<p>I torrented the game, could files be corrupted?</p>

            <p>Try loading a savegame from earlier on (when the game was running fine), after re-starting the game.</p>
