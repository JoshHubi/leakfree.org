    <title>Portal March 3 New Ending: Portal 2 on the way.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-march-3-new-ending-portal-2-on-the-way/3245</link>
    <description>Well, finnally we get something from Valve about Portal 2 or Half-Life 2: Episode Three!

Here is the new ending: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DahRNnWGLk[/url]

The rumours have been surounding the Steam forums from this March 1st.
Portal has been actualized to another version twice: March 1st and March 3rd, also GLaDOS has been actualized to the version 3.11. 
Another Achievement in wich you can get morse codes and weird images its called Transimition Recieved and in wich you have to carry the radio all around the Portal.

This didn&#39;t make sense to the Valve fans because the images were so weird and nothing were making any sense but then I finished the Portal again today and in this update: March 3rd there was a new ending secuence  :smiley: 
The end has been changed with around 30 more seconds in which you can apreciate something like a robot carrying your character after distroying GLaDOS.

The only change is that you will hear heavy mechanical footsteps followed by a robotic voice saying:

&quot;Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position.&quot; 

The old ending in contrast simply faded to black in that scene.

Well, there are loads of rumours and the most exciting one it&#39;s that they are going to show us something in this GDC (game developers conference) This March 11th. Sound familiar? Glados Version 3.11  :smiley: 

Apparently if you carry the radios around in the game at the moment these messages will broadcast. The achievement &quot;Transmission Received&quot; can be earned this way. There are 26 areas where it must receive. Be careful though because the containment field will vaporize them.

            <p>that’s pretty neat. So a robot originally programmed to retrieve poeple normally in the test chambers if injured or harmed, steps out and drags you to a place we dont know yet…? very cool.</p>
