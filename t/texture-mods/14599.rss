    <title>Texture Mods</title>

    <description>I just can&#39;t figure out how to get Workshop textures to, well, [i]work[/i]. Other types of workshop content are basically plug-and-play, but I downloaded two texture mods and this was the result:

One of the mods (the [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=467215084&amp;searchtext=Winter&#39;]Winter BM[/url] one) is pretty old, but [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=597599309&#39;]the Russian translation one[/url] was definitely published after the Great Redesign. Winter BM is no doubt responsible for most of the purple seen above, but neither mod works properly. You can see that not [i]all[/i] textures are affected, just the ones the mods try to replace.



Loading a level in this state produces many error messages of the form
*** Error unserializing VTF file... is the file empty?
Error reading texture header &quot;materials/some/texture/path/texture.vtf&quot;
(but it doesn&#39;t seem like one for every single texture lost, there seem to be fewer error messages than missing textures?).

Texture mods in the content folder do not appear to contain VPKs, VTFs, or any other type of asset file I am familiar with, but rather a single file called [i][SOME LONG UNINFORMATIVE NUMBER][/i]_legacy.bin .

I&#39;m putting this in here instead of bug reports because other people seem to be running texture mods just fine and so the problem is likely something I am doing wrong on my end.</description>

            <p>Ok, looks like opting <span class="bbcode-i">out</span> of the public beta restores the older texture mod to working order. It should be possible to make a workaround for the newer one as well…</p>
