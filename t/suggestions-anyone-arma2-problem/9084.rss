    <title>suggestions anyone? arma2 problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestions-anyone-arma2-problem/9084</link>
    <description>So I decided to jump on the DayZ bandwagon and buy Arma2 with Combined operations, I looked around for a cheap option having missed the steam sale and got it from a cdkey site that provides a download to the game after purchase. problem is its been cut into pieces, 12 pieces in fact. so thinking fuck that! i went and torrented a copy thinking during the installation id be able to input my key, but no. this genius made it to crack the game during the installation and negate all the DRM. Anyone have any idea where to get a full download of the full game with all the security bits intact? 


oh, and it&#39;s not a steam copy of the game so activating it in steam wont work. before anyone suggests that.  :&#39;(</description>

            <p>Yeah, To be honest I took a leap of faith with this site. It seemed legit, but there were a few things that didn’t look right. From their FAQ for Example;</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What to do when I’m not satisfied with your service?</span><br>
Send us an E-mail stating the reason why you <span class="bbcode-b">aint</span> satisfied</span></p>
<p>but the key checks out okay, and I got it for a good 10 dollars cheaper then everywhere else, but definitely not using the service again. ha</p>

            <p>Sorry but, you’re going to have to download the 12 Parts. All the torrents are cracked, I would upload my stuff, but it’s steam version.</p>
