    <title>EXTREMELY minor issue with tau cannon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/extremely-minor-issue-with-tau-cannon/11125</link>
    <description>When you sprint with any weapon besides tau cannon, the weapon lowers when sprinting, then rises smoothly when sprint button is released. When you sprint with tau cannon, it smoothly lowers, but does not rise smoothly, instead abruptly warping to its normal position. I hope that made sense. :fffuuu:</description>
