            <p>I tried it…im gunna list what i liked about it, and what i didnt.</p>
<p>Pros<br>
I like the music, it really helped set the mood<br>
interesting concept for a story<br>
New textures</p>
<p>Cons<br>
Definitely stole the hound eye right from the BMS Alpha leak<br>
HARD!!<br>
Stole weapons from other mods<br>
The way the screen moves up and down when you walk. (it gave me a seizure…LITERALLY)<br>
The irons sights</p>
<p>So when i first started playing, i really like the intro, despite the shitty animation of gman. But when you enter the room and you leave, the first thing you want is a gun. So for the first 20 minuets i played the damn thing, the whole time i was think “When am i gunna get to shoot something?” and after i found the healthkit weapon thing, i still couldnt figure out what to do with it!! So i had to actually look up a walk through FOR A DAMN MOD!!! but after i found out what to do, and you enter the room with all those fucking poison crabs, i picked up the pistol BUT THERE WAS NO AMMO IN IT!!! and thats where i stopped playing</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh yes the “If it’s 'sposed to be realistic then u can only die once! U gotta have total realism or no realism, no in 'tween.”<br>
You can make some parts of a game realistic and others not. Just because it’s not your kind of game doesn’t make it bad. That’s like saying COD games suck because you can aim down sights and knife people, or saying Halo sucks because you can’t. The only reason I responded is because the only reasons people gave about why the mod “sucks” sounded pretty much like “it’s not like HL2s gameplay style.” It actually is, just from the POV of a citizen.</p>

<p>I liked the godamned mod! Fuck fast-paced shit. I thought it was very well thought out and entertaining, a lot better than many of the mods out there. Also, the bobbing and iron sighting are for realism, you try running sideways and keeping your head striaght, as for the iron sights, it makes sense, when you use a gun a magical crosshiar doesn’t appear to help you aim, you use the sights, that’s what they’re for.</p>

            <p>I just beat 1187.  The Combine are at the end (spoiler in the black text at the end of this post).  The vorts are still enemies because they are still wearing the slave shackles.  I suspect an in-game explanation is that after the destruction of the Nihilanth, many vorts remained slaves to their Nihilanthian programming whilst others rebelled against it.  This latter group is who you see in HL2.</p>
<p>Spoilers in the black below:<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]After clearing the restaurant, you overhear a group from the Omega Squad speaking with…well, my opinion is that it’s an Advisor.  Bennett suggests you take the car to a small town called “Outercurve” (I think that’s what it’s called).  Once you get to the town, you have to deal with hordes of Omega Squad and a couple of helicopter gunships.  Once those are eliminated, John and Bennett meet up with you for battles with vortigaunts.  Once those are eliminated, you witness a gigantic portal opening up in the sky and a ginormous number of Combine coming through it.  John shouts out that they can take them --that we didn’t come all this way to die now – and a Combine gunship comes at you.  My opinion is that it’s the start of the Seven Hours War.  The screen fades to black and…cue the Gman.</p>

<p>Wrong. If you listen to the news in-game, it takes place after the BM Incident, portal storms everywhere. While this could still mean that it takes place before Freeman finishes in Xen, it also says Dr. Breen is touring the country, giving speeches about what happen. That implies it’s been a bit since the BM incident.</p>

            <p>Strange tutorial indeed.</p>
<p>The headbob and being stuck at the beginning killed the mod for me. Maybe I gonna try again in a few weeks to see if I’m wrong.</p>

<p>No, it does not. In the beginning you can watch a news report saying “It’s been 10 years since the Black Mesa incident”  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It looked promising, but after playing it for a couple of hours I realized it’s just a waste of time.</p>
