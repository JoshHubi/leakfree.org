    <title>Batman: Arkham Knight announced (by Rocksteady)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/batman-arkham-knight-announced-by-rocksteady/13051</link>
    <description>&quot;Explosive finale in the Batman Arkham series where players will take to the rooftop and now – the roads of Gotham as for the first time the iconic Batmobile becomes driveable”.
Set one year after the events of Arkham City, Game Informer states that a entirely new area of Gotham City is featured in the game, and the map is “far larger than Arkham City”.
The streets are wider to accommodate the Batmobile, and villains include Scarecrow, Penguin, Two-Face, Harley Quinn, and others.

Game is coming out for PC,PS4 and Xbox One later this year.</description>

            <p>Game’s been pulled and WB said they’re going to re-port the game, I imagine using Rocksteady this time. Steam refunds are turning out to be fucking amazing.</p>

            <p>Interesting thing is that apparently there was a day one patch on consoles but not on PC. Maybe someone fucked up somewhere and forgot to release the day one patch and we’re seeing the game before it. If not then Rocksteady and the third party they paid to port the game over both fucked up. Also the Steam rating was earlier 29% and now it’s 31%.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/batman-arkham-knight" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">1.5 user score on Metacritic</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/208650/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">69% negative reviews on Steam</a></p>
<p>Aside from performance issues, apparently the PC version is missing some effects that are present (or at least much more noticeable) in the console versions - ambient occlusion, wet surface textures and (possibly) bokeh depth of field. Texture streaming seems to be an issue on some systems as well.</p>
<p>(don’t have the game myself)</p>

            <p>I think it speaks pretty badly for devs if they delay a game and STILL can’t release a finished product. Before they could at least blame short deadlines, now they have no excuse. Hopefully Arkham Knight’s delay means they actually release a fully functioning game.</p>

            <p>I’m not saying that, but there has been a lot of stuff lately with games being released seemingly unfinished because devs try to adhere to a yearly dev cycle. This wasn’t happening here, but even if you work on a game for more than a year that doesn’t guarantee the game is as finished as it should be. And it seems lately devs are catching onto this and delaying their games for the better rather than releasing them unfinished and broken like has been done a lot in the past. I mean given the way that Watch Dogs was released, I can’t even imagine how bad it would have been if they hadn’t delayed it. Arkham Origins I remember also had a lot of complaints about game breaking bugs and such.</p>

<p>It was really pretty but I wish these “gameplay” trailers actually had a true gameplay sequence instead of just tiny snippets of gameplay and cutscenes.</p>
<p>On the part where he gets on the batmobile and it drives away from the camera, I wish it had smoothly transitioned to a sequence of uninterrupted gameplay with the hud and showing what’s new for the gameplay, even if staged to all hell. At least it would be better than flashing bits of the game.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I initially liked fighting as Catwoman, since she made Batman look sluggish in comparison (especially when you got the combo bullet time thingy), but then I started playing in Hard and NG+ and she lacks the ability to disarm and destroy weapons, unlike Bats. Then it started to piss me off.</p>
<p>Besides, I never liked characters that fight with skintight or with no much armour. I felt they were suicidally confident or just trying to be sexy for the sake of sexiness.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Also you do understand that Catwoman’s thing is that she uses her cleavage and ass and leather to distract the people that would otherwise be beating the shit out of her, right?</p>
<p>I mean, that’s her whooole fucking shtick. Deception and shit. She’s <span class="bbcode-i">catwoman.</span></p>
