    <description>It&#39;s available for pre-loading now through Steam!!

I&#39;ve already finished it twice on the 360, but my brother wanted to play it so I got it on Steam (and to see how good it looks on DX10/11).</description>

            <p>Urgh. What about Fable II for PC? That I <span class="bbcode-i">actually</span> want to play.</p>
<p>From what I hear, the issue with this game is pretty much the issue with every other Fable game: Its too simple. The combat has been dumbed down to the maximum possible extent, and the morality meter is just, well, far too simple. Watch the Zero Punctuation review, but as I understand it, the latter half of the game involves effectively being the ruler and making a whole bunch of decisions about the administration of your lands, but the dichotomies are so hyperbolic its ridiculous. For example, you can either choose to fund a school or a brothel. Its okay, but nowhere near the RPG it promised to be.</p>

            <p>Looks unimpressive from the <span class="bbcode-i">screenshots,</span> but those are screenshots. I’ll have to play it to decide.</p>

            <p>The graphics are really good, the combat’s basically the same as the first 2, though possibly slightly faster overall once you know what you’re doing, and you’ll actually care about the story, instead of there just being an evil bad guy you need to get stronger to defeat. The best bit is the humour though. Although a few jokes might not be noticed by anyone not from the UK, there are some incredibly funny bits, including one level that is a complete send-up of table-top roleplaying games as well as RPG video game design cliches.</p>

            <p>Was it any good? The first was amazing but the second was okay. If this is better than the second and it has Dx11 then maybe I’ll buy it.</p>
