    <title>Half-Life Registering problems</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-registering-problems/1762</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I bought the Half-Life Anthology in Russia last summer, and found out that I could only register in in Russia, so I need some help. I need someone here who lives in Russia to install Team Viewer, so I can use your computer to log on into my steam account. I think it&#39;s much better than just giving my account password and the CD key away. If possible, please have an English version steam installed. After all this, add me to your friends list on steam, so we can work out a time to do this. One final note, [u][b][i]PLEASE[/i][/b][/u] do NOT try to steal my steam account. I hope that someone reply to this.

My Steam name: Communist Cake Commander

            <p>I don’t know what you’re talking about, I bought and registered the Orange Box in Russia, and I can still play all the games, so my account wasn’t locked.</p>

            <p>Note that if you register everything in one country, then start using it in another it’ll get your account locked as a hijack-prevention.<br>
I ran into this setting up a gift account in Singapore for my brother in NZ - made the account and bought some games in it, but he got locked out as soon as he tried logging on.<br>
(This was before Steam implemented gifting games.)</p>
