    <title>Mouse not responding good.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mouse-not-responding-good/11769</link>
    <description>Hi,

I got the following problem in game, when i try to use mouse1 (fire) it does not respond only untill i rapid click it 10 times or click it really hard it fires sometimes, but its unplayable like that ingame. It works and responds just fine normally and even in the menu but in game its just not usable. I figured it was something bugged in the mod so i played with fire on scroll. 

Just today as a installed Urban Terror i noticed i have the same problem over there  :frowning: 

So im wondering if someone here know how to solve this issue that would be great

I got a Logitech RX 250 and playing on windows7.</description>

<p>I solved it by shutting down some asus software.</p>

            <p>it’s probably the trackpad software, go to control panel, mouse, touchpad settings and disable typing protection</p>

<p>I found out my mousepad works fine ingame when there is no external mouse plugged in. But as soon as i do it responds the same as my mouse.</p>
<p>Also when in not using my keyboard. The mouse reacts without problems.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with a laptop I used to use for games; while I was holding down any of the keys, the trackpad became virtually unresponsive.</p>
<p>I never found a fix for it, unfortunately.</p>

            <p>I had a Logitech MX518 that started doing the same thing. It was fine on Windows but in-game the right button just wouldn’t respond most of the time.</p>
<p>So I replaced it with a new mouse.</p>

            <p>Thats what you would think indeed, something must be broke if it doesnt react as it should, but this only occurs while im playing in game. In the menu there are no problems, the mouse just responds on every click without delay or anything.</p>
<p>Just when im playing this game it only seems to be responding a bit when i excessively bash the mousebutton. Since it did not bother me anywhere else or in any other game i dident really care. But since i have the exact same problem at another game there must be something that could fix it.</p>
