    <title>Is Black Mesa written in C++?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-black-mesa-written-in-c/62258</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious about which programming languages did you use to develop Black Mesa game?
Studying computer engineering right now (2nd Class) and i&#39;d like to talk with a developer in BM Team.
That would make my perspective on Programming even better.

Have a nice day!! ^_^</description>

            <p>Sorry for being late , i was dealing with my homeworks and midterms!<br>
I also see you guys are busy with Xen release it’s okay and good luck!<br>
I am curious about AI (for example human grunts) , how do you handle their sight ?<br>
I mean the process that seeing Gordon and attacking him.</p>

            <p>If you’re interested in the Source engine and whatever is going on behind the scenes with it’s development or the games that are built with it I recommend the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">Valve Developer Community</a>. Alternatively you could Google around for a bit or maybe boldly message a Valve developer personally.</p>

            <p>A majority of the (gaming) industry is written with C++, depending on what you’re trying to achieve, what language is used will vary wildly (I’m a CS major too).</p>
<p>If you want to learn a bit more about the Industry, I’d suggest going to <a href="https://talk.turtlerockstudios.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Turtle Rock Studios’</a> forums and reaching out to Lianne (Snowkissed) and Steve (Arpharazon). No offense to the guys and gals behind BM, but they’re usually radio silent except for a few people.</p>
<p>The two people that I mentioned I got quite a bit of info out of, and they’re usually pretty chatty. So long as you don’t look for specifics on their projects they can tell you quite a bit about the industry as they’ve been in it for quite a while.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa is running on the Source Engine (made and owned by Valve Software, licensed by the Black Mesa devs), which indeed is written in C++.</p>
<p>As for speaking to a Black Mesa dev, I’m pretty sure that they’re busy finishing the game at the moment.</p>
