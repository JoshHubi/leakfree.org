    <title>here is my new mod : Assault-Strike , The Cooperative Mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/here-is-my-new-mod-assault-strike-the-cooperative-mod/12412</link>
    <description>most people from here seem to have liked my first mod , it inspired them for some part to make...
i wish this one will help you the same way ... 

the mod size is a bit heavy for an Half-Life Mod : 3 Giga ...
1.2 Giga for the 474 Maps
0.9 Giga for the 1439 models

to make it easy to have fun quickly , there are three mapcycles themed with mods [220 maps], maps [180 maps] and horror [60 maps] . one is called nextmap to quickly terminate current , you can reuse it for a new time limit or others settings . the map is also used to prevent &quot;bypass of map&quot; , svencoop engine change nextmap il will load , when players reach map changelevel position so i added nextmap when its a serial of maps . if serial has 3 maps then mapcycle launches first and 2 nextmap , some will learn how many maps they could play if they do not reach the end of map before timelimit ;&#39;]


mapcycle_mods.txt plays maps of half-life and opposing-force &quot;extended&quot; with some azure-sheep and decay maps , case-closed , earthquake test center and operation black-thunder . hl campain may need to have seen half-life done quick to open closed doors ... 
mapcycle_maps.txt has most of the well known and good maps of svencoop mods ; see the details of maps in maps_order.htm in the mod folder
mapcycle_horror.txt has maps that are &quot;complete conversion&quot; : tetris, toorun , reco...and also 

the maps that need some jumping skills like in escape .
these maps-files are also having distincts config files so three servers can be launched at once , by default servers use 27006-8 27016-8 and 27026-8 ports if server is on internet open these ports .

for windows :

start hlds.exe -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map escape_series_2a +exec server_horror.cfg +interp


start hlds.exe -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map blackfacility.bsp +exec server_maps.cfg +interp


start hlds.exe -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map e5m5_new +exec server_mods.cfg +interp

linux :


./hlds_run -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map escape_series_2a +exec server_horror.cfg +interp


./hlds_run -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map blackfacility.bsp +exec server_maps.cfg +interp


./hlds_run hlds.exe -console -netthread -game astrike +maxplayers 2 -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -tos -noipx -nomaster +map e5m5_new +exec server_mods.cfg +interp


read the readme_linux.txt to learn more about linux and setup . the -nomaster will make your server hidden from unknow players , can be useful at the begining when setting server up .

think of changing the &quot;mp_timelimit 1&quot; in maps_exec_*.cfg as well as the rcon password in autoexec.cfg . make the update of the password in your files for playing so you will be able to send rcon commands to server and also to update the admins.txt with your steamid .


players will not be able to play as much maps , half of them and then a crash ...
it is due to the fact that more files are loaded per maps .
there is a hl_player.bat that optional parameters to launch game , you should add : -netthread -insecure -heapsize 1310720 -num_edicts 3072 -preload -nohltv -noipx -nojoy
there is a folder : astrike_downloads because of the soundlist that is downloaded at each connection , it can have undeleted txt files in astrike_downloads\maps\soundcache , that happens if you connect to a server while it is showing scores at end of map : it forgives to delete . 


you should be able to download mod files from moddb page : [url]https://www.moddb.com/mods/assault-strike/downloads[/url] , i made two folders at Mega with files for windows and linux
the archives are the same and are made to make easier the install .


windows A-S
[url]https://mega.co.nz/#F!qIJSjLDA!JzVfOlptpjwOZ2w2ML1HfQ[/url]


linux A-S
[url]https://mega.co.nz/#F!7EIjkIJQ!M0r4piLrlNRMsAFNBNmQNw[/url]

i advise to use google-chrome to download the files from this hoster .

last thing about metamod and fmodex dlls , they are latest . make backup of fmodex.dll in case this one breaks your other mod [try once if your mod support the provided dll can be a good idea, if that works ]

have good times playing that great mods with nice maps and wonderful models designed and released by many modelers , that you can find at moddb or elsewhere ;&#39;]
after playing it you will know why gabe newell wants to buy svencoop... [&quot;8  hehe [ i am not very friend of them...hehe ;&#39;]</description>
