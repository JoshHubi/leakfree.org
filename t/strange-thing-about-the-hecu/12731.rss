    <title>Strange Thing About the HECU...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-thing-about-the-hecu/12731</link>
    <description>It appears that when you spawn a HECU grunt in water, fully submerged, he&#39;ll have the default pose and then, after a few seconds, will die.

Why is this behavior in the game? Or has it always been there from Half-Life 2?

Steps to replicate:

1. Find a water source big enough to be fully submerged in it standing up.
2. Type in console: npc_create npc_human_grunt
3. Watch it die.</description>

            <p>Agreed.  You are trying to make the game do what it was never meant to do so you’re going to get an error.  In short, this is not a bug or a feature.</p>

            <p>The NPC’s were never programmed to swim, so they have no swimming code and animations. However, being underwater still triggers the lack of oxygen code and as such they’ll eventually die.</p>
