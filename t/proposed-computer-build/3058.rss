            <p>ATI video drivers are fine now.<br>
They have a monthly release schedule, and most significant issues are corrected in less than a month either in a new release, or with a hot fix.<br>
There is only issue I know of remaining, but can be easily worked around to get working.</p>

<p>That depends I guess. Are you really set on a multi GPU rig? If you are looking at a couple GTX 295 cards, I’m assuming that you have a display that has at least 2MP, and do significant work with that area.<br>
If you are set on a multi GPU set up then I’d say an i7 920 with a Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD3R is a good bet. Might suggest triple channel memory kits with that.</p>
<p>If you are sticking with a single GPU ( which is what I would suggest ) any of the three boards I’ve mentioned are perfectly good performers, and a good deal less expensive than the one you posted.</p>
<p>Right now for a single GPU set up either the 5870, or 5850s from ATI are the obvious cream of the crop, but if you are an nvidia fan, I might suggest holding off a short couple months. Rumor has it the DX11 nvidia GPUs are just around the corner. You’ll probably get better performance from one of the new nvidia GPUs than an SLi config with a pair of GTX 295s…if nvidia hopes to retake the performance crown that is.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thats just the thing though, I want a system that will be equally… “happy”? with either a single or multiple gpu solution. That being said, I am going to take a look at the Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD3R. Lastly, I think I am going to stick with Nvidia for the moment, the reviews of ATI cards I read still say that they have terrible drivers, besides, this build is not happening for a few months so I have time to wait for Nvidia to catch up.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Performance per dollar on DDR3 ram goes down significantly after DDR3 1333. If you are looking for performance an OC overhead I’d suggest DDR3 1600.</p>
<p>As for the mobo, if you are looking at the P55 chipset, you have to remember that when you have a multi GPU configuration set up the max transfer rate of each lane is lowered to x8. This makes Quad SLi all but useless. If you bought a second GTX 295 ( a card I wouldn’t suggest ) you would notice bottleneck from the limitations of the chipset. As you add more GPUs it will become even more apparent. If you are looking for a massive multi GPU set up x58 is the way to go. I would put forth the idea that large arrays of GPUs are unneeded and not very cost effective right now.<br>
A single GPU is usually the best route to take right now.</p>

<p>The WD caviar Black series are the faster drives. Better platter density. I am always weary of Raid0 arrays because of possible data reliability issues.<br>
One other thing, because of the restrictions of the P55 chipset, I’m not sure what benefits you are looking at with that beast of a mobo. You might save some cash with the MSI P55 GD80, or the Gigabyte GA-P55-UD5. Both are gems for overclocking, and packed full of features.<br>
On a related note, I built another system using the MSI P55 GD65 ( step down from the GD 80 ) and the OC genie clocked the i5-750 at 4.1GHz totally stable. It set the core voltage too high, but with a good cooler many people wouldn’t even notice. There is a lot of overhead on these i5 750s. I’ve not had too much experience with the -7 800 series though.</p>

The main reason I looked at that mobo was the insane ram speeds, and the quad sli possibility, (I am looking to do that in the future)</p>

<p>I won’t speak for compatibility because I’m sure you’ve already done your homework, but when considering performance, I’d recommend swapping out the WD Caviar Green for a Black model. The “Green” lineup only has a 5400rpm rotation speed, which would be alright in several applications, but when coupling it with an i7, 8GB RAM, and a dual GPU, you’ll have a serious bottleneck.</p>
<p>Also, the GTX295 is starting to show its age.  If you’re willing to spend a little extra on a much more advanced dual-GPU card (DX11, greater overclocking ability), I’d recommend getting the ATI 5970.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have absolutely no experience with ATI cards made after 2003, do they still have performance issues with Direct X?<br>
I also ment to choose the 7200rpm model, but I was a bit pressed for time and chose the first one I could could find. Will I still find a bottleneck with 7200 rpm? I am trying to comprimise volume and price, would a 500gb raid0 array with 2 Hdds be a good alternative, I can always gut my external HDD for its 1TB HDD to make up the 1.5TB goal I have for this computer.</p>
