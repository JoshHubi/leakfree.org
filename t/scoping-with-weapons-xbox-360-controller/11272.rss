    <description>Hi,

even though i cant find any decent informations about this so set a &quot;key&quot; for it in options, Valve games can scope with right mouse click or not? well, i&#39;ve also tried playing with keyboard and mouse and cant scope there also. Any ideas? :frowning:</description>

            <p>Valve games are more traditional-style, which means no ironsights. If the weapon has a mounted scope though, you can look through the scope using whichever key is bound to “alt fire”.</p>
<p>“Alt fire” enables the secondary function of the current weapon. On some weapons it’s a grenade launcher, on others it’s a scope, on others it’s a charge-up, etc.</p>
<p>In Black Mesa, the game follows the same rule, with the ONE exception of the .357 Magnum, which uses ironsights as a secondary “alt” function.</p>

            <p>Currently, there are no weapons in any Valve games (and as a result, Black Mesa) that have an ironsight function bound to it’s own key. The Left 4 Dead games did have a dedicated scope function for scoped weapons, but this was due to the fact that all guns had the same secondary function; meleeing.</p>
<p>The only two weapons in Black Mesa with usable zooming sights/scopes are the .357 magnum and the crossbow, and both are activated with the key/button bound to secondary fire.</p>
