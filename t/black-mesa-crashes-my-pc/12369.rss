    <title>Black Mesa crashes my PC?!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-crashes-my-pc/12369</link>
    <description>Hello,
for some reason, Black Mesa seems to crash my PC sometimes. It was first rare but i&#39;m now at the chapter Residue Processing, and my PC crashes now every time I try to start the game. It&#39;s really frustrating and also irritating, because I can play, for example, Skyrim on High graphics without lagg, and it never crashed my PC. 

By the way, I&#39;m sorry for my rather bad English, my native language is German.</description>

            <p>I had that happen occasionally to me when my computer overheated. It happened especially on graphically intensive games.<br>
Then my GPU had a massive heatstroke and I got a cooler one.</p>
<p>Of course, if you can play Skyrim on high without it overheating, I’d look to the drivers before buying a case fan or new card.</p>

            <p>It might be your hardware.<br>
I also had this with a game.When I launched it, the whole computer shut down.<br>
I was not able to fix it, until I got new hardware.</p>

            <p>It really is my whole PC that crashes. I can even hear it shutting down, because it becomes suddenly extremly loud and then abruptly stops. I don’t have multiple hard disks, and my GPU drivers and chipset drivers are both up to date.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6q8iphZ4Rk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Maybe the problem wasn’t your PC?</a></p>
<p>Ok just kidding, but seriously is your PC crashing or just the game? Try windows+L or ctrl+alt+delete. If none of the above work and num-lock has no effect on the keyboard lights, then it’s your whole PC that crashed.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, start by removing any overclocks if they are set up. Second, do you have multiple hard disks? If so, put Steam on the most stable HDD (same as Skyrim maybe?) reinstall/extract BM again and use steam to verify the Valve game files.</p>
<p>Third, maybe you need to upgrade your GPU drivers or chipset drivers. Other than that, maybe your PC just doesn’t like Black Mesa in its current setup due to a recent Valve update (I know they moved from the GCF file format among other things).</p>
<p>If you lose your saves, you can resume the same chapter by using sv_unlockedchapters command in console.</p>
