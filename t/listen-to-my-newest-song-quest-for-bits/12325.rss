    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/listen-to-my-newest-song-quest-for-bits/12325</link>
    <description>The links below, listen now!  :wink:

So Quest For Bits is my newest song in probably 7 weeks during which I&#39;ve been experimenting with new vst&#39;s and learning a bunch of effects and production styles to help spice up my music. This is the first song I used Ozone Isotope to master the whole thing, and it turned out to be pretty amazing. 

If there&#39;s any other people who make music here I&#39;d gladly appreciate feedback. Hope you like the song!</description>

            <p>Keep in mind, this is just a personal opinion. Don’t take it personally.</p>
<p>I found it to have too many midtones. The beginning would have sounded better with an echo chamber effect.</p>
<p>Overall, the sound lacks dynamics and showed too much repetitiveness.</p>
