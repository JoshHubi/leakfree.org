    <title>My Computer Is Completely Fucked (Please Help)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-computer-is-completely-fucked-please-help/4317</link>
    <description>So anyway, out of the fucking blue one day my monitor shuts off. I try to turn it on, and my desktop seems to be frozen. White lines running through it and whatnot. So I turn off the tower by holding down the start button. Turn it back on and from here on out it&#39;ll just plain freeze on the welcome screen.

My computer is an HP desktop and i&#39;m using Windows Vista. It freezes on the welcome screen. I&#39;ve tried system repair, no dice. I&#39;ve tried restoring to a previous date. Nothin&#39;. The computer itself is only a little over a year old. My Norton Anti-Virus subscription has been expired for a couple of weeks. But I don&#39;t visit any sites I shouldn&#39;t be nor do I open anything suspicious. I only really use it for games. So I can&#39;t possibly think of what the problem might be besides maybe a hardware issue. In which case i&#39;m going to have to dish out some money to get it repaired.

So I thought i&#39;d try and see if anyone knew any alternative solutions. Please help if you are so inclined. I&#39;d appreciate it, thanks.</description>

            <p>I don’t know how much help this is seeing how you’ve already done a format (meaning all your data is gone), but try going into the BIOS and resetting it to factory settings (usually F5 to load defaults and F10 to save and exit, but this might vary). Then boot from a Linux (Ubuntu) live CD to see if this works.</p>
<p>If the live CD works then you might be able to see what the problem is from within Linux, and maybe use MemTest (it’s on the disk) to check your memory.</p>
<p>Also, if you manage to get into Linux from the live CD, feel the fans on your PC to see if they’re running hotter than usual.</p>

            <p>HI,</p>
<p>I think so that the problem might be with the the system, As the system is too slowed down. When you start the PC when it start just go to the run command and then type “msconfig”, In the msconfig  panel disable all the startup as well as disable all Non-Microsoft services and restart the PC. These will solve your problem, but you still need to remove all the unwanted softwares from your PC and clear all the temp as well as unused file. These will really speed up your computer as the new one.</p>

i know it seems like some commercial shit that doesn’t work, but trust me, it does. it is very easy to install/deinstall drivers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>oh, and you’ll have to torrent it or buy it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>EDIT: bleh, didnt read the whole thread, this probably doesn’t work if reformatting didn’t. but driver checker is still a great program :3</p>

<p>Well sorry to hear that Grum. I’d try to help more, but without being able to look at it myself it’s kinda difficult. However, if you’ve tried reformatting and reinstalling Windows and that didn’t work, it’s definitely hardware related. It really does sound like the video card but it could be just about anything. Test everything you can before you take it somewhere so you’re sure its nothing you can fix yourself (since a lot of computer repair places really overcharge). If you have multiple sticks of RAM, try taking them out one by one to see if you have a bad stick. Flash your BIOS, test your monitor, take out any add-on cards, try disabling onboard devices in your BIOS, basically anything to try and identify a problem device. If you can’t it’s probably your motherboard or processor.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick replies guys. Yes, I can boot into safe mode. It’s about the only thing that works besides all that other stuff I mentioned. That’s why I have a hard time thinking it’s a video card issue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>When you boot into safe mode, it only boots the driver for VGA mode, a low-resolution, low-color mode that even messed-up cards can boot into. So it could still be your video card, but it may just be your video drivers. Try booting into safe mode, uninstalling your video drivers, and then use a driver cleaner like <a href="https://downloads.guru3d.com/Guru3D---Driver-Sweeper-(Setup)_d1655.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a> to completely clean out any traces of them. Then download the latest drivers for your card from the web and install them. If you can boot up and set your resolution back to normal, congrats, it was a driver problem and you’re done. If not, see if you can find another card from another computer, or maybe borrow one from a friend, to test in your computer to see if your card is borked. If that doesn’t help, post more info so we can narrow it down.</p>
