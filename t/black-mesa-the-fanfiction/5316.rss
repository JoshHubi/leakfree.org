    <title>Black Mesa: The Fanfiction</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-the-fanfiction/5316</link>
    <description>Long story short,[/SIZE] SanFROD was &quot;I swear somebody was going to do a BM fanfic.&quot; in group chat and I was &quot;Fuck it I can write one just now.&quot; The following was all written in group chat, so I had no idea where the fuck I was going with it.

[COLOR=&#39;PaleGreen&#39;]This is also a general thread to post your fanfics about the Black Mesa community, BUT I SWEAR TO GOD IF IT&#39;S ABOUT THE ACTUAL MOD AND NOT IT&#39;S MEMBERS I&#39;LL SUFFOCATE YOU. This is a fine ladies club, I don&#39;t want any of your &quot;Gordon Freeman is G-Man from the future; in Source.&quot; bullcrap.


[b]POSTAN.[/b]



...Sanfrod thought about the possibility for a mere second, giving RabidMonkey just a slight playful smile as to aknowledge his notion. &quot;Maybe next time, sweetheart.&quot; she whispered into his ear as she turned him on his tummy. She slowly tucked off her underwear to reveal her already pulsing penis. RabidMonkey quivered for a mere moment, afraid of what SanFROD&#39;s gigantic meat could cause to his rectum, but he was not going to lose another bet to Raminator. He manned up and held his breath, she was already opening his cheeks.

Deep in the catacombs, Raminator&#39;s bionic livers started pumping out all the rum he had had in the last months. The monitors lighted up before his chair as the automated defence system centered all cameras on the jail room where SanFROD was plummeling down on the already crying RabidMonkey. &quot;THE FUCK DID I DO?&quot; he shouted, still weak from the stupor of waking up. &quot;FUCK, MY HEAD.&quot;

&quot;RELEASE THE MOTHERFUCKING KRAKEN.&quot; Raminator shouted, as his bionic livers streamed the last of the foul alcohol&#39;s remains away from his system. A series of beeps and bloops followed. On the opposite side of the complex a rusty door cracked and automatically opened to reveal Raminator&#39;s secret weapon. Suggestive detracted himself from the ceiling of his robo-prison and stepped forward. He was called for once again. 

&quot;A uterus is needed. BRING ME A GODDAMN UTERUS. I WANT TO CHOKE THAT FAGGOT WITH IT FOR TAKING THE BET SERIOUSLY!&quot; - the voice in the com-chat was somehow familiar. Suggestive knew he had heard it before. But he couldn&#39;t remember. It all seemed... so strange. The medications flowing from the capacitor on his back. He would never remember. Raminator was making sure his pawn obeyed his will without any question. &quot;GO TO THE HOOKER BASEMENT. GET ME ONE, QUICKLY.&quot; he directed anxiously. &quot;THEN PREPARE MY EXO-SKELETON. I THINK...&quot; - the chair creaked as Raminator&#39;s massive junk unloaded its weight from its rickety supports. He stood up, firmer, in every sense of the word, than ever.  - &quot;I&#39;LL NEED TO... CHOKE A BITCH!&quot;
