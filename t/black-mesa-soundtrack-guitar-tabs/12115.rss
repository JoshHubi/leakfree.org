    <title>Black Mesa Soundtrack - Guitar Tabs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-soundtrack-guitar-tabs/12115</link>
    <description>I have been looking around the web for plain text guitar-tabs of the songs from the Soundtrack (End Credits 1 in particular), but to no avail. 
Thus, I decided to do it myself and post it here.

Since the text won&#39;t display properly on the forums, I made it an attachment to this post.


I very much welcome feedback and improvements or hopefully someone else might be kind enough to post their own version of this song or any other song from the album.

Thank you!
