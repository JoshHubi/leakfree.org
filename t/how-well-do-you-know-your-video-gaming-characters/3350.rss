    <title>How well do YOU know your video gaming characters?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-well-do-you-know-your-video-gaming-characters/3350</link>
    <description>Is it kind of scary when you can at least name most of the characters, or their respective games when you look at this picture?

            <p>cool compilation, but many of them aren’t original game characters but comics or cartoons later made into games.</p>
<p>if i may, i’d like to post another similar picture:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>EDIT: i’m not saying there aren’t any unoriginal game characters in this one but it drives more at the good ol’ classical games. somebody wrote he/she was searching for twinsen, for instance.</p>

            <p>I am glad I don’t recognize many of those characters in the OP picture.</p>
<p>Still funny, though, how most of the male “heroes” are armoured and armed, and most of the females are either showing much skin or wearing body-shaped armour. And, of course, have porn star measurements.<br>
Glad that Alyx is still an alternative.</p>
