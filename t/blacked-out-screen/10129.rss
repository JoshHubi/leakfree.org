    <title>Blacked Out Screen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blacked-out-screen/10129</link>
    <description>Ok, I know I&#39;m new, but I downloaded Black Mesa Source yesterday with much anticipation, and have played it when I can up until the scene where you have to turn on the generators to use the train. 

At the below place in the map, every time I get to the stairs, the screen goes black, and never comes back. At this level the screen also started to black out when receiving damage from anything. 

Any ideas what would cause it, or how to fix it?

HELP! :fffuuu:

<p>If you don’t get what’s the difference between bug tracker and forum it doesn’t mean that they are the same. Educate yourself on google or in wikipedia on “task-based workflow” and “issue management” topics, it’s a pretty interesting info to read IMO.</p>

            <p>Ok, so update time:</p>
<p>I continued to try different video settings, (essentially low settings across the board) and after quite a few attempts, the “blacked out” screen became blue. (Also had to restart the computer and Steam) When the screen went blue, I was able to use the flash from the gun to navigate my way through. After getting to the next map, I re-set the settings, and it was fine for the rest of the game. I beat the game the next day. Thanks for those that tried to help. I’m still not sure what was wrong, or even sure how to fix it.</p>
<p>Good luck to those who had similar issues like mine.</p>

<p>… Also, I just went into the game to double check the DirextX setting…nd the intro screen “whited” out on me. It showed initially, then went white. If I put the mouse over the options (quit, load, options, etc) they illuminate with the mouse, bus disappear the soon as I move it.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, it all sounds extremely similar to what people get when try to use “freshly” updated HL2 with dxlevel 70. Thus I’m concerned that the problems you have are related either to the game using older renderpath or to the videocard and/or driver failing to work properly with the DX90 renderpath in case it’s what really used by the game.</p>
<p>What else could you do to check for dxlevel:<br>
a) Add “-dev -console -windowed” to the game startup command line;<br>
b) Open up console by pressing a key with “`” and “~” (to the left from “1” on keyboard) and type in there (pressing enter after typing in each line:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">disconnect
mat_dxlevel
mat_hdr_enabled</code></pre>
<p>Second and third commands should give you some output, copy/paste it to this thread. Settings that I expect to theoretically be correct for your videocard are:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">] mat_dxlevel 
"mat_dxlevel" = "90" ( def. "0" )
] mat_hdr_enabled 
HDR Disabled</code></pre>

<p>HL1+1 - is it original HL using GldSrc engine or HL2-series? CS - original 1.6 or a CS: Source successor? How about TF2 or Portal or Portal II?</p>

<p>And back on topic about being helpful: you posted that you’ve got Radeon X300 GPU and you also posted that you had tried changing mat_dxlevel but the game just freeze. This card is essentially a mobile version of Radeon 9550 which is known to be auto-detected by the game as a card which is better to be used with dxlevel 80 or 81.</p>
<p>Thus, could you answer two questions:<br>
a) What does the game list in the Oprions-&gt;Video-&gt;Advanced…-&gt;Hardware DirectX level?<br>
b) If you have 80 or 81 there: had you read what was posted <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=499538#post499538" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and had you tried following the instructions on changing dxlevel posted in the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14063" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">answer to the question 6 of the now-sticky FAQ</a>? If you hadn’t - give it a try. And once again - trying to change dxlevel by executing mat_dxlevel XX in the in-game console most of the times won’t work properly and would crash/hang the game immediately or made it into unstable state extremely prone to crashing and producing visual glitches until you would finally happen to restart it. If affects any Source-based game, Black Mesa included. And after restarting most of the times you would be left with the dxlevel you had before executing mat_dxlevel XX because actually dxlevel to use is stored in the system registry which gets updated by the game on a graceful exit - and it does not happen most of the times if you use mat_dxlevel to switch renderpath. You should use “-dxlevel” to be on the safe side and you should not leave it sitting in the game’s command line forever.</p>

<p>I have DirectX 9.0. All my windows/computer components are up to date/current versions. I hopefully will be gettin a new computer this spring, but until then I have to make due with this dinosaur, lol</p>
<p>Also, I just went into the game to double check the DirextX setting…nd the intro screen “whited” out on me. It showed initially, then went white. If I put the mouse over the options (quit, load, options, etc) they illuminate with the mouse, bus disappear the soon as I move it.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think this game just won’t work with my computer, or I have a more serious issue. What bugs me is HL1+1, as well as CS work without issue. Ugh.</p>
<p>And thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I’ve got the same problem with switching to the “blue screen” near toxic lakes. And I’ve found solution that works for me.</p>
<p>I 've just turned on HDR in the advanced video options and picture had come back to normal, and become more shiny that it was. And perfomance had not decreased.</p>

<p>If you hadn’t noticed - people do get their problems resolved in other threads soon after they post details on their problems. Ignoring requests to follow reporting guidelines and post the required info and instead keep on posting useless spam like “me to, me to, game’s broke, help!” - that is what’s not helpful.</p>

</aside>
<p>Take it simple:<br>
a) There are forum rules and reporting guidelines posted at the top of every forum page. Why do you thing those guidelines are posted there?</p>
<p>b) OK, a person in trouble happens to be in a much hurry and misses guidelines prior to doing his or her first post. Then a number of other persons kindly reminds that knowing hardware and software specs is essential to be able to help. Does the person i question reacts to it?</p>
<p>c) Person gets yet another reminders to include system specs. You think this is too offensive/insulting, do you?</p>
<p>It is a free public internet forum. People trying to help others on this forums do it at their free time and have nothing for that. If the bug reporter really want to get some help - he or she could at least try to respect other people on forums by following forum rules and posting guidelines. You’re free on refusing to do that but expect get some disrespect and/or hostility in return. And, BTW, posting something like “the game don’t waerk when I do play it pleaz help-help” without providing details is considered being SPAM on most other game forums. Moderators are more than tolerant here.</p>
