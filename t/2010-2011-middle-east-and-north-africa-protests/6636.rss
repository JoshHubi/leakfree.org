            <p>Tbh I can’t really this being anything other than a very intricate move more their natural resources by both the west and fat-cat monopolists within the middle east, isn’t it funny that these protests happened overnight in predominantly muslims countries? I’m all up for give each individual as much democracy as they need (aslong as it doesnt take away from other peoples democracy), but the fact that most of the public in these countries as simply protesting instead of putting through reforms is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I hope they sort it out soon though, regardless of for what reasons, countless (Over 9,000) deaths have been caused and need to be stopped.</p>

            <p>Some dislike Mohammed VI, others praise him.</p>
<p>There were protests over there by both sides, and some Moroccans over here went to Brussels to QQ as well (silly, since they’re not in Morocco anymore, so whatever Mohammed VI does should have no effect in them).</p>
<p>Nothing major like I said, but who knows, it might ignite at some point.</p>

<p>i am sceptic about the situation down there. revolution, cool as it is, often “outdates” the revolutioners. before revolution is over the people who started it might see themselves with a new order they didn´t want. for example if some <span class="bbcode-b">fundamental muslims</span> take over control who think that freedom ain´t such a great thing after all.<br>
i´m just exaggerating here, but you never know what you end up with when tearing down governments too fast.</p>

<p>what the west don’t want, is people practicing Islam. sadly cause they’re very “scared” of them blowing shit up</p>

            <p>the signs are apparent! the downfalls of great empires, a dark shadow in the east, THE END IS NIGH!</p>
<p>i am sceptic about the situation down there. revolution, cool as it is, often “outdates” the revolutioners. before revolution is over the people who started it might see themselves with a new order they didn´t want. for example if some fundamental muslims take over control who think that freedom ain´t such a great thing after all.<br>
i´m just exaggerating here, but you never know what you end up with when tearing down governments too fast.</p>

<p>I’m happy that the people are finally taking action.</p>
