    <title>[ADDON] Black Mesa: Re-Balanced</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/addon-black-mesa-re-balanced/10290</link>
    <description>Many things in Black Mesa aren&#39;t right - some enemies/weapons are op, some of them are underpowered. This simple mod of mine will change some variables, making game both harder and nicer to play. So i present to you...

[img]https://imageshack.us/a/img641/7017/logoaub.png[/img]

For old changelogs and version vistis [url=&#39;https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmrebalance/&#39;]https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmrebalance/[/url] .

//Current ver: 0.2

[b]What was changed?[/b]



*  Player&#39;s throwforce was downed a bit,
*  Pistol and MP5 do a little extra damage,
*  Same happens with shotgun, snark and MP5 grenades,
*  NPCs weapons were buffed too,
*  Now you can carry 28 additional ammo for .357 (previously 1, and 10 satchels (previously 5), also you can carry up to 30 snarks,
*  Hivehand is a bit more accurate, both for player and NPCs,
*  Gluon consumes 3 ammo/sec,
*  Security guards have more HP,
*  Zombies are buffed. They are still slow, however normal zombie have 100 hp (previously 40), and melee range 80 (previosuly 75), so it will be a little harder  ,
*  Zombified security have sam melee range as normal zombies (80), however they have now 150 hp instead of 50,
*  Zombies now do 20 dmg if they slash with claw, or 40 if they slash with both,
*  Headcrabs do 8 dmg instead of 5,
*  Vortiguants are buffed. Now they have 50 health points, they need 1.5 second to recharge, and they do allitle more damage (35 in case of zap, 15 in case of slashing with their claws),
*  Apache is nerfed. It&#39;s easier to destroy - it have almost the same hp amount as Abrams,
*  Houndeye&#39;s blast do more damage,
*  Osprey is tougher, you need 5 rockets to take it off,
*  Mines do more damage (cmon, THEY ARE MINES!), they took only 1/4 of players health, now they take 3/4,
*  .357 was nerfed, now you can carry only 16 additional amo for it,
*  Crowbar was buffed, now it takes headcrab in one hit,
*  Snark hives contain 3 of them instead of 8, you can carry up to 10 of them, however their dmg was buffed,
*  AI reacts slower,
*  Shooting head or chest do more damage than shooting stomach, arm or leg,
*  Ichthysaur is harder to kill, one bolt isn&#39;t going to do the job now  :wink:  , also they hurt a bit more,
*  Implemented walk button (ALT).


What do you think about it? Write your ideas here, i will think what would i change in next version. What should be nerfed, what should be upgraded?

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>^ recommendations on that, I have my own config that I feel is unnecessary to share but if you want to make them smarter and tougher just open your skill.cfg and plant these values in:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sk_alien_grunt_health				"90"
sk_alien_grunt_hornet_min_range		"0"
sk_alien_grunt_hornet_max_range		"2048"
sk_alien_grunt_melee_range			"94"
sk_alien_grunt_melee_jump_range		"166"
sk_alien_grunt_melee_dmg			"30"
sk_alien_grunt_front_dmg_scale		"0.8"
sk_alien_grunt_turn_speed			"30"
sk_alien_grunt_rage_threshold		"5"
sk_alien_grunt_rage_reset_delay		"10"</code></pre>
<p>What it will do is make them have more health (per hl1) and they’ll fire their hivehand in melee if they feel the need (usually it’s after a few swings with the crowbar)</p>
<p>My .cfg that I used is really based around realism and making the game uber tough. Agrunts have those same values, but the melee damage is 70, and the health is 250 instead.</p>

            <p>Have you changed the Alien Grunt health? They are way too easy by default, they should be scary enemies to fight, and they would be if they didn’t go down so quick.</p>

<p>Wait, am i just reading it wrong or is that a bit paradox?</p>
<p>Well because of the “previously 1” i guess you just got the .357 in the first line wrong…</p>

            <p>The only thing that really needs changing is the MP5 mag capacity. Up to 50. Or you could up the damage a bit instead, like +1/8. I don’t think you can change the first in skill.cfg tho.</p>

            <p>Is this rebalanced with normal in mind for the default setting, or hard?</p>
<p>Also, why not include the auto crouch jump vars with everything else?</p>
<p>I also think buffing the handcannon’s ammo capacity isn’t a great idea. I’ve always seen/used it as my emergency situation get out of jail free card. Give it too much ammo and it’s just too good at evrything (and also completley devalues the glock).</p>

            <p>I made a similar cfg, except I left enemy health largely intact while buffing weapon damage for both NPCs and the Player</p>
<p>the result was that weapons felt powerful, and enemies (especially creatures) felt dangerous.</p>

<p>I was looking for a way to improve the Mp5 slightly and this little fix seems to do a lot of good, but it also changes things I thought were fine in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The houndeyes for example, I thought they were tough enough when you come across a group as usually its a close encounter and you end up getting a lot of damage before you can get rid of them all. They seem to attack too quickly.</p>
<p>The things I really like about this fix are the damage increase for some of the guns and the delay for the Vorts attack.<br>
Not sure if I like the idea of having to hit a headcrab twice, does it remove the satisfaction of whacking one with a crowbar as its jumping?</p>

            <p>I was looking for a way to improve the Mp5 slightly and this little fix seems to do a lot of good, but it also changes things I thought were fine in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The houndeyes for example, I thought they were tough enough when you come across a group as usually its a close encounter and you end up getting a lot of damage before you can get rid of them all. They seem to attack too quickly.</p>
<p>The things I really like about this fix are the damage increase for some of the guns and the delay for the Vorts attack.<br>
Not sure if I like the idea of having to hit a headcrab twice, does it remove the satisfaction of whacking one with a crowbar as its jumping?</p>

            <p>Instead of recalibrating the whole game, just delay enemies reaction time, and nerf their aiming and that’ll do it. No need to go into that kind of drastic changes.</p>
<p>Ever considered that all equipment that’s placed on maps was designed for the current ammo capacity / damage system? How will you change that?</p>
