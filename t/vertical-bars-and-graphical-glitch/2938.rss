    <title>Vertical Bars and Graphical Glitch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vertical-bars-and-graphical-glitch/2938</link>
    <description>My computer crashed due to a video driver failure while playing BioShock so I decided to go online and update my drivers from the ATI website. After the install, however, my screen now has these weird vertical bars that look glitchy and full of static. Rebooting the computer just causes blue-screens and right now I&#39;m barely running in Safe Mode. 

I would Print Screen but doing that doesn&#39;t show any of the issues. 

Any idea what could have caused this and am I going to need to replace my graphics card or other hardware?</description>

            <p>I tried doing a clean uninstall of the ATI drivers and then reinstalling them, but uninstalling them created no changes in visual quality and attempts at reinstall give me some strange error about the driver detector not working.</p>
<p>I’m going to try some of the suggestions on that site TheJuraj about the chipset, but now I can’t even login in either normal or safe mode, so I’m not really sure what I’m going to do.</p>
<p>Update: Dang it, nothing I do can get it to log on anymore. Guess I’ll have to find a way to replace it. The system was 2 years old, so I guess it was going to need an update sooner or later.</p>

            <p>Try uninstalling everything regardin to your videocard drivres while in safe mode.<br>
Then make sure you d-load the right drivers from the develoers site and reinstall them.</p>
<p>In old ATI and NVIDIA cards there were updating issues if you tried to install a newer version upon an older one.<br>
Good luck mate.</p>
