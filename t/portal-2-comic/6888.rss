As long as you have no source for this statement there is no reason to ignore the song in relation to the story. It is totally canon and - like a movie score - semantically connected to the events in the game (in movie scores, this counts for the end credits as well).</p>

<p>You are disregarding the facts, in that case: Still alive. That’s what I wanted to point out. But please let me explain a little more:</p>

<p>But you go on to interpret yourself?</p>
<p>It is a <span class="bbcode-i">song</span>. Don’t read too much into it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a difference between reading stuff into something and reading stuff OUT of something. The latter is the basis of good interpretation. So when I said “not much room for interpretation” I actually meant “I wonder if you would read something different out of the quoted song passage”. Sorry for the confusion.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I tried to stick to the song text as closely as possible when interpreting it in my previous post - please feel free to show me where other interpretations are plausible as well. I wonder if you would read something different out of the quoted song passage  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, except that you cannot read out of the song whether she is lying or not. So assuming that it is indeed all sarcastic, <span class="bbcode-b">that</span> is reading stuff <span class="bbcode-i">into</span> the song. That’s why I said your statement was wrong (btw, I know it’s rude to say such things the way I did, so my apologies good sir), because I see no hints or facts that point only toward your hypothesis.</p>

If you went back and played the game you would realize that glados is one of the most <span class="bbcode-i">SARCASTIC</span> video-game antagonists ever. She’s probably not “happy for you”. Either way, this is what i think, because you think/have interpreted something different, does not necessarily make it wrong.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s wrong. I highly recommend you to read the lyrics of <span class="bbcode-i">Still Alive</span> once again. GLaDOS there basically states that killed test subjects are part of its test program. Actually she refers to the killed test subjects as “mistakes”. Here let me quote something:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>for the good of all of us except for the ones who are dead<br>
but there’s no sense crying over every mistake<br>
you just keep on trying until you run out of cake<br>
and the science gets done and you make a neat gun<br>
for the people who are still alive.</p>
<p>[When you killed me] I was so happy for you!<br>
Now these points of data make a wonderful line<br>
and we’re out of beta, we’re releasing on time<br>
so I’m glad I got burned<br>
Think of all the things we learned for the people that are still alive</p>

<p>I would say that it is canon, since Valve pretty much hired a writer and an artist to make this story under their direct supervision.</p>

<p>IIRC, the writers and artists of this comic were already employed by Valve.<br>
Why get outside people to do it (even if under your surpervision), if you can get the people who have worked hard on the portal universe themselves to do it?</p>

<p>Then tell me: Was GLaDOS destroyed, because Chell defeated it on her own or was GLaDOS planning its destruction as the final exam of the tests?</p>
<p>The latter seems more probable, considering the song “Still Alive”, the cake room with the remaining personality cores and Doug Ratman’s statement “She is in the final chamber [with GLaDOS]”.</p>
<p>But then again: Why did he pick Chell anyway? To defeat GLaDOS? Why did he pick someone stubborn if not to resist the tests?</p>
<p>I never know when Chell actually rebels against GLaDOS or when she does something GLaDOS expected (or even hoped for).</p>

            <p>This comic was really well made. Loved the bit where chell enters deep sleep and the thought of quantum entanglement rears its head.</p>
<p>Hope they do something like this for HL2: ep3…</p>

<p>Or they’ll pull a System Shock 2/ Bioshock on us, and GLaDOS will be impersonating him.</p>

            <p>I would say that it is canon, since Valve pretty much hired a writer and an artist to make this story under their direct supervision.</p>

<p>Is this comic canon? If it is then the whole relation between aperture and black mesa just became very different. What if Aperture had chargers from Black Mesa in order to test how they would work? What if they made their own versions of the chargers which were then modified for use by the combine?<br>
SO much speculation so little time!</p>

            <p>Awesome comic. I love how it gives you a good sense of the things that happened before Portal 1.</p>
<p>Although I <span class="bbcode-b">still</span> don’t know whether Chell really fights with GLaDOS or whether this is just another part of her sick tests.</p>
