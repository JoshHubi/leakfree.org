    <description>Recently got a GTX460 Nvidia card, and i seem to randomly get a red or yellowish hue every now and again, it&#39;s rether annoying seeing as i can&#39;t see what i&#39;m doing whilst playing most of my games.

            <p>Check your monitor connection.  Sometimes, you can lose contact for a single color channel, which would cause things to all go tinted.</p>
<p>Otherwise, make sure everything about your video card is properly seated.</p>
