    <title>Game won&#39;t start</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-wont-start/10431</link>
    <description>I downloaded the game, everything works.

I changed the resolution, and it stopped working. I left, and whenever I try to go in now it pops up

Warning!

(the link does not work for me).

How do I fix this! I tried uninstalling, then reinstalling. Still does not work. Sorry if this is posted somewhere else.</description>

            <p>Nevermind! To those having this problem:</p>
<p>Go to Steam.<br>
Go to Black Mesa in your Library.<br>
Right click it.<br>
Click Properties.<br>
Click Set Launch Options.<br>
In the box, type -w 1024 -h 720 exactly.<br>
Click OK.<br>
Launch the game.</p>
<p>(I got this info from a thread from another forum).</p>
