    <title>My account was deleted?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-account-was-deleted/13731</link>
    <description>I tried logging in today only to find that it said my username didn&#39;t exist on the website. I had to completely re-register my account.
I wasn&#39;t notified that I&#39;d broken any forum rules, and I was able to re-register with the same e-mail, so what gives? Did the website delete me automatically for some reason?</description>

            <p>Ah, I see. Thank you for the explanation!<br>
I’m not too upset by it, I’m just glad to know what happened.</p>

            <p>What Joe said. I’m really sorry for that. There were literally 400+ spam bots that registered out of nowhere completely destroying the forums. I tried to delete as many as I could. Sorry about that. I will triple check the list next time.</p>

            <p>We were hit with a large wave of spam bots, so it’s possible your account accidentally got caught in the nuke when they were removed. I can talk with someone and see if we can figure out what happened.</p>
