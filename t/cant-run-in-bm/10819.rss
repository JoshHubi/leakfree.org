    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-run-in-bm/10819</link>
    <description>Hey,
i have a problem when im playing black mesa. When im pressing SHIFT (to run) my character not sprinting, is walking little more slowly. When i am pressing the ALT button (for walking slowly) nothing happens.
i tried to change the bindings key for those commands, but everything stays the same (exept from the key i changed)

Can u help me?

and sorry for my spelling mistakes.</description>
