    <title>New EVE Online Micro-transaction</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-eve-online-micro-transaction/7393</link>
    <description>So incarna was released last night with new space stations and micro-transactions.
I think they should have added the Captains quarters as an option and kept the old station environment, so say you dock and you go to the old station, then you can go chill in the CQ rather then load stuff and try get out again before your PC overheats.
Also the Micro-transactions are really that micro. $60 for a monocle. you could probably buy irl monocle for that. I would have preferred to keep all currency as PLEX rather then add AURUM into every ones wallets knowing that only 25% of people are ever going to have any aurum.

New turrets look nice though.</description>

            <p>bdlkion, you sound like a buthurt old player that forgot that it’s not all about 0.0 and not every one wants to be moon mining fatman.</p>
<p>I think you also need to revise your definition of alliance.</p>

<p>Yes, do you? Don’t know what shitty alliance you were in, but in my alliance the leaders actually share most of the stuff regarding finances (especially if it’s something like the tech moon profit) with other members. And it’s easy to check how much profit you actually get from the tech moons. It’s not some top secret stuff that no one knows about apart from the owners.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, not all of it goes to alliance wallet. Actually some moons are owned specifically by corps and all profits from them go to the corp wallet. I know this cause I was in such corp.</p>
<p>It’s true that some, if not most corps don’t get the profits from tech moons in straight isk form but they get it trough other means like system upgrades, stations, srp etc.</p>

<p>Like I said, I played about a month ago. I never calculated my dps but I ran a Megathron with t2 railguns and t2 hammerheads. It took a long time to run missions with a lot of Gist battleships, which was pretty much the only missions I had. I could obliterate dozens of Angel battlecruisers and frigates in a few minutes, but those battleships took a really long time. Idk if my damage type was not optimal or if it was just the fact that they like to get underneath my range falloff, but they were a pain to deal with. Plus I’m slow as hell, like 130m/s, so if there’s a group 90km away it takes a long time to get over there and get in range to attack.</p>

<p>Hm. Not really enough to get me to play again. It still just takes too long to do anything in that game for my taste. Just to run and salvage one level 4 mission takes me at least an hour and a half, more if I get the wrong survival guide and have to change my hardeners, which is pretty often. I think they changed some of the missions so now there’s multiple guides out there.</p>

            <p>Fair enough, I’d say it’s a game that gets better with time when you try out new things, like scanning and the like.<br>
It does take an inconceivable amount of time to do anything though.</p>

            <p>Hm. Not really enough to get me to play again. It still just takes too long to do anything in that game for my taste. Just to run and salvage one level 4 mission takes me at least an hour and a half, more if I get the wrong survival guide and have to change my hardeners, which is pretty often. I think they changed some of the missions so now there’s multiple guides out there.</p>

            <p>Remodelled some ships, minor UI changes, New gun models, buyable clothes and accessories for character customisation.</p>
<p>And yeah the new items are stupidly expensive.</p>

            <p>So besides micro transactions, what changed? I was playing on a friends account about a month ago, most everything seemed the same as it was for years other than weapon groups and the portrait maker.</p>

            <p>The irony of the new items for sale is that their equivalent in real life to isk are more expensive than actual real items</p>

            <p>Eve is boring, I’ve been playing this for 4 years, And In the end, the only fun thing about it is learn how to make huge amouts of money and then sell it for irl $$</p>
<p>You know why all big alliance leaders try that hard to keep their alliances going ? Because they make money for doing so.</p>
<p>I’ve read somewhere that holding the 450 technetium moons for a year would make a million dollar worth of ISK.</p>
<p>Also, proof if you dont believe, here is the director log of one of the big Eve boss :</p>
<p>[00:20:52]  good old times when I was selling isk 40€ per bill<br>
[00:21:01]  now if I get 20€ I am happy</p>
<p>A good player can make 20 billion per month.</p>
<p>A big alliance leader can make trillions in a year …</p>

            <p>So incarna was released last night with new space stations and micro-transactions.<br>
I think they should have added the Captains quarters as an option and kept the old station environment, so say you dock and you go to the old station, then you can go chill in the CQ rather then load stuff and try get out again before your PC overheats.<br>
Also the Micro-transactions are really that micro. $60 for a monocle. you could probably buy irl monocle for that. I would have preferred to keep all currency as PLEX rather then add AURUM into every ones wallets knowing that only 25% of people are ever going to have any aurum.</p>
<p>New turrets look nice though.</p>
