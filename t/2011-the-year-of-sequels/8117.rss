    <title>2011 - the year of sequels?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2011-the-year-of-sequels/8117</link>
    <description>Dead Space 2
Crysis 2
DNF
Gears of War 3
Dragon Age 2
The Witcher 2
Portal 2
DE:HR
Arkham City
Uncharted 3
BF3
MW3
Skyrim
Saints Row 3
AC:Revelations

Is it just me or are there more sequels than usually this year?
Srsly, the only original IPs I got remotely excited (and eventually been gutted) about were LA Noire and Rage.

What do you think?</description>

<p>To be fair, while that is usually right, there have been some major changes in gameplay this year on FIFA, not just minor refinements.</p>

            <p>The way I see it, a video game sequal is totally different than a movie sequel. Generally 100% of the time, you don’t want to see a movie sequel just because you want more thrill. You want more of the story.</p>
<p>In a video game however, you want more of the experience. Granted, video games aim for replay-ability, but a sequel that aims to give a player “more” (Best examples are probably ACII and L4D2) are what really bring in the big bucks.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Movie sequels are for story, game sequels are for fun.</p>

<p>Since the gaming technology evolves so rapidly, videogame sequels generally surpass their predecessors.</p>
<p>However, most improvements are mainly superficial and/or accessory. Also, for most games there is rarely a reason for the continuation of a storyline (with Mass Effect being the only exception I can think of right now).</p>

            <p>New IPs are a risk. Going with proven IPs more or less ensures a good profit for the developers and publishers. Even new IPs that have been coming out recently, like Rage, are drawing on the popularity of previous titles with similar settings and motifs. There is innovative stuff, but it usually comes from independent developers who aren’t counting on a huge return. There are some big devs that take risks on new ideas, but unfortunately, unless the first entry makes a huge splash, it may take a long time, if ever, for more to come out. Mirror’s Edge springs to mind - while it was generally considered a successful game, it didn’t become huge, and so it’s kind of been in limbo for years.</p>
<p>TL;DR - it’s all about dat cash</p>

            <p>It is very difficult, from what I’ve noticed, to create an original game idea, today.<br>
A lot of those games listed are based around fanbases that have been around for a pretty damned long time.<br>
Someone would have to come up with a pretty outrageous story and gameplay mechanics (or at least greatly improve old ones) in order to appeal to the masses.</p>
<p>Honestly, I would be willing to play another time-alteration game if they delivered it correctly. I fucking loved TimeShift!</p>

            <p>Since the gaming technology evolves so rapidly, videogame sequels generally surpass their predecessors.</p>
<p>However, most improvements are mainly superficial and/or accessory. Also, for most games there is rarely a reason for the continuation of a storyline (with Mass Effect being the only exception I can think of right now).</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay and interactive storytelling there seems to be very little to no innovation lately (regarding triple A titles). Just more of the same, bscly.</p>
<p>Now, you might argue that this has always been the case (in any major medium for that matter), also I admit that I may exaggerate a little, but don’t you think that in an industry that’s growing so rapidly with so many titles coming out every year, the next big thing to rock the gaming world is long overdue?</p>
<p>…sry, slightly off topic.</p>

            <p>Video games have always been more sequel oriented than movies, so it went down that path long ago. The main difference is that video games sequels are much more likely to be good.</p>
