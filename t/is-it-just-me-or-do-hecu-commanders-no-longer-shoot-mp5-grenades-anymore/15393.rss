    <title>Is it just me or do HECU commanders no longer shoot MP5 grenades anymore?</title>

    <description>I played Black Mesa a year or two ago and I seem to remember the HECU commanders firing MP5 grenades, something that didn&#39;t really happen in the mod version.  However, I recently started doing a full playthrough of Black Mesa, and it seems they no longer fire MP5 grenades at all.  Is this intentional, or are they just bugged, or do they fire them super rarely now, or what?  (also whatever happened to their sick shades?)</description>

            <p>Wait really? I’ve played all the way to Forget About Freeman without noticing then! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And yeah the thread is old, but there’s not a lot of activity around here anymore, and Mmod came out with grenades, so it seemed relevant.</p>

            <p>Check the date, this topic was from 2016. HECU using mp5 grenades was re added in the ST:U update.</p>

            <p>MMod added Combine SMG grenades and a lot of people praised it. I for one greatly enjoyed it as well.</p>

<p>Yeah… I saw it, and I talked to Adam-Bomb about this. Very unfun especially on Surface Tension. However, this is one ability that is distinct from Combine Soldiers. This ability must be restored with tweaks. Distinct animations even from afar. Using them aggressively, and not in corners :V. Distinct audio cue.</p>
