    <title>Games on 64-bit Windows 7</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/games-on-64-bit-windows-7/6843</link>
    <description>My laptop&#39;s slowly dying, and I&#39;m planning to replace it with a mid-range gaming laptop. However, they all seem to come with Windows 7 64-bit, and I&#39;ve seen people here and on other forums complaining about how hard it can be to get games running well on 64-bit systems, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth going for 64-bit. Are there any specific games that don&#39;t like it, or is it most games pre-Vista, or something else?

TL;DR: will Windows 7 64-bit stop me playing older games?</description>

            <p>I cant think of a game I havent been able to run and if i havent been able to run it, its not a fault with win7 x64.</p>
<p>With some old games, you can disable aero and kill explorer with a batch file. (AoE2) you can also have it set to run as xpsp3 and as administrator. Win7 x64 usually will run most games you throw at it. I dont regret going win7 x64.<br>
I was very reluctant to install win7x64. At first i installed 32bit but my hdd power cable fell off (the end thats on the hdd collapsed and is now superglued togeather)<br>
Im sure you can imagine the result.</p>
<p>Dont install x86 version of alc 120% on x64 versions.<br>
Dont install the dreamscene plugin from vista (its so shit and buggy, just dont do it.)</p>
<p>32bit is for ppl that pay some idiot techie $500 to format ya hdd. If you got the cpu and enough ram, go x64.</p>

            <p>I play a lot of older games and newer games on Windows 7 64-bit. Haven’t had any trouble out of any of them yet.</p>

            <p>This shouldn’t even be a question up for consideration.</p>
<p>There are almost always workarounds for getting older software to work on x64 operating systems, not to mention that incompatibilities are rare to begin with. There is also a reason that newer computers come with a 64 bit operating system: aside from supporting over 3gb of RAM (which 32 bit operating systems don’t support without extensive modifications), software that DOES run on 64 bit OSs runs faster, can use more of your machine’s RAM, and is becoming more widely available.</p>
<p>In short: go x64, no brainer. You won’t regret it</p>

            <p>Most of my old games still work fine on Windows 7, with the exception of Starcraft: Broodwar. Getting that to work is a nightmare</p>

            <p>I’m not a software wiz but couldn’t you replace the OS by buying win7 x32 and installing it? Sure it’ll cost $125 American bills but it’d be worth it.</p>

            <p>Also, you can run dos games with a free program called dosbox. Works like a charm, use it to play Raptor: Call of the Shadows on my Win7 x64 machine.</p>
<p>At this point, I don’t see a reason not to go 64-bit. Even though there isn’t a whole lot of 64-bit optimized software or games out there now, there will be in the future, and there’s not a whole lot of stuff that you can’t run in some form or fashion anyways.</p>

<p>How about you do die, since you seem completely incapable of contributing to any discussion you enter? I kind of like that idea.</p>

<p>i don’t think he offended you, anyway</p>
<p>haven’t encountered any problems with installing games, even older ones(maybe except black and white, could also have been because the cd was really “scarred”)<br>
should you encounter a problem with installing a game on win 7 x64 google will almost certainly help you because chances are then you’re not the only one with that problem with a specific game. there’s almost always someone who provided a tutorial to get anything to run</p>

            <p>God help you if you want to get a Dark Engine game like System Shock 2 running. I had to sacrifice a goat to make it work.</p>
<p>But generally it’s not that big a deal. I had to do some fancy install tricks with some older games like DFII: Jedi Knight, but in general it’s not a problem.</p>

            <p>My laptop’s slowly dying, and I’m planning to replace it with a mid-range gaming laptop. However, they all seem to come with Windows 7 64-bit, and I’ve seen people here and on other forums complaining about how hard it can be to get games running well on 64-bit systems, and I’m not sure it’s worth going for 64-bit. Are there any specific games that don’t like it, or is it most games pre-Vista, or something else?</p>
<p>TL;DR: will Windows 7 64-bit stop me playing older games?</p>
