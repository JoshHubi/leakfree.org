    <title>I think I fried my computer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-think-i-fried-my-computer/4436</link>
    <description>For some reason, my computer (laptop) keeps on shutting down when I put too much stress on my processor. Trying to run a game, multiple programs, etc. causes it to shut down. I haven&#39;t been able to play any of my games for a while now. My best guess is that this is caused by overheating; It&#39;s been getting really hot as of late.

Does anyone know what&#39;s causing this, or better yet, how to use this to my advantage by frying my computer?*


*In case you don&#39;t get why I would want to, I&#39;m using a Dell Inspiron 1525 with 2 GB RAM, a 1.73 GHz processor, Vista, and some awful graphics card.[/SIZE]


Edit: I may have posted this in the wrong section. My bad.</description>

<p>fix’d</p>
<p>to OP: Did you check the cpu temps ocasionally? what were the highest values you’ve monitored?</p>
<p>Also, cpu’s don’t overheat simply because the cpu is stressed (unless it’s for days)<br>
Either the cooling system is jammed with dust (you did mention cleaning it)<br>
Or the cpu is OC’d (it isn’t, is it?)<br>
Or it is slowly coming to it’s end (in wich case you can underclock it or just watch it die)</p>
<p>P.S. I am in way an expert in these kind of things, so if anyone notices I’m talking rubbish here, please correct me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>[edit] also, placing it on a desk instead of a pillow would help too  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I just looked it up on Google, but the ASUS G72GX is about 1.5k. Are you talking in terms of Euros or something?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes. You said it was integrated, but saying “I have an nvidia GPU laptop lol” is a stupid thing to say, really.</p>
<p>Also, russilker, the 9800 GT really isn’t all that fast nowadays. I like mine, it works fine. But I can’t wait 'til I get the money to upgrade to a 5770.</p>

            <p>Well, actually, saying that laptop GFX cards are nowhere near their desktop counterparts isn’t too accurate anymore. My laptop that I got for 1k at Best Buy has a GTX260m, which is pretty close in power to the desktop 9800gt.</p>
<p>If you’re looking  for a good, cheap gaming laptop, the best way to go is ASUS. If 1k is your  limit, I highly recommend the ASUS G72GX. The G73 is currently the most powerful gaming laptop, which can be found for around 1.2k</p>

Get rid of vista, get 7, i have win7 ultimate, and its (in my opinion) microsofts best OS yet. Awful graphics (A.K.A integrated graphics IE. Intel graphics) get a nvidia GPU, technically all laptop Graphics cards are inigrated but i have an nvidia GPU laptop (I have a HP Pavilion DV9700, Great computer, and i got it cheap at microcenter, it was only $650, and it can play crysis on high) and it has never failed me.</p>
<p>end statement…</p>
<p>get a better computer, especially if you are going to play demanding games like all modern ones</p>

<p>SpeedFan, the problem is that SpeedFan reports the Tcase temperature (on top of the CPU) instead of the actually temperatures in the core.</p>
<p>If you add ± 10 C you should know the core temperatures. 50 C in SpeedFan probably means 60 C in the core.</p>
<p>And why do you hate Everest? All you have to do is click on ‘computer’ then go to ‘sensors’ and wait for it to load the temps.</p>

<p>My CPU seems to be too ancient for this app. Shame that CPU-Z doesn’t show the temp.</p>
<p>Anyone know of any other similar apps? Besides everest: I hate it, too full of crap.</p>

<p>Download the programs I posted, they are used by pretty much every overclocker and easy to use for monitoring speed and temperature.</p>

            <p>Download three programs:</p>
<ol>
<li>GPU-z (to monitor the graphics processors temperature under idle/load)</li>
<li>RealTemp (to monitor the processors temperature on idle/load - the TJ Max is automatically set to 100)</li>
<li>EVEREST Ultimate Edition (to monitor the motherboard temperature on idle/load - look under ‘computer’ -&gt; ‘sensor’)</li>
</ol>
<p>If a computer shuts itself down while it’s under load then that means you’ve reached a thermal threshold of a certain component, this is usually caused by either the processor or the graphics processor. The motherboard threshold depends on the board, it usually ranges from 65 C to 85 C.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found the component which is overheating, get a can of compressed air and clean the inside of the computer (especially the heatsinks and fans). Don’t use a vaccuum cleaner as they will generate static electricity which will fry your computer. When using the laptop make sure there’s enough room for proper airflow (don’t put it on a bed or something because this will block the airflow)</p>
<p>@ Level</p>
<p>Laptops can’t melt, the processors themselves would have to be over 2000 degrees, the plastic housing of a laptop is usually made of a type of plastic that gets harder when it’s heated - not ‘softer’. You should be fine unless you go over 250 C, which is impossible because there’s no component that will work even near that temperature.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>Try to maintain these temperatures:</p>
<p>CPU: don’t go over 65 C for 24/7 use<br>
GPU: don’t go over 85 C for 24/7 use</p>
<p>I wonder how warm your laptop would get if you let the CPU run Prime95, it would probably go way over 100 degrees (I suggest you don’t try that. :p)</p>

<p>oh wait, it is a lap top.  hrm. You know I always wondered about that.  How exactly are you supposed to keep a laptop cool?  place it on a metal rack so that the bottom doesnt get so hot?  there should be little shelf like things that come out that way if you want you can raise the bottom a little. Sort of like what you see on a keyboard.</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p>There’s the possibility you’ve fried or melted a part already, but your best is to call Dell and ask them what’s wrong, and see if you can get it replaced (if it’s under warranty).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>CALL DELL?!? ASK THEM TO GET IT REPLACED!!! The last time my friend called dell to get new computer parts they came a month later then what they said when it would come in. When the parts came in, they were the wrong parts and took 30% off of the payment, a another month later they came back with THE WRONG PARTS AGAIN! So now the parts are free. Waiting time…at the bottom of the list…yea good luck getting help from dell…</p>
