    <title>Suggestions for a laptop mic for lectures</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestions-for-a-laptop-mic-for-lectures/5537</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to record audio during lectures so I don&#39;t have to keep typing notes, but my integrated laptop mic is shit.  Anyone know of any good laptop microphones, that would work for lectures?

Edit: just realized what a stupid question this is.  Oops.</description>

            <p>Eh, the snowballs and snowflakes seem pricey.  I suppose I’ll stick with taxi_evil and the ol’ pen after all.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

            <p>My advice is spend the money on a good pen and a notebook, and take notes the old fashioned way</p>
<p>Seriously, I know people that have tried dictaphones and all sorts, but you learn a lot more through the act of actually writing it. I take rough notes in lectures, then write them up later in my own words. This gives me something to revise from, and picks up anything I don’t understand</p>

            <p>not that stupid, depends on a few things, how close will you be, whats your price range, and does it need to be direct to your pc?</p>
<p>If your are close enough and have a little extra cash I would recommend something like the Blue snowflake $50~$60. I haven’t used it personally but I have use the blue snow ball and was VERY impressed with the company.</p>
<p>In almost in every case you will get much better quality over USB but if you want something cheaper you can still get usable material over the mic port.</p>
