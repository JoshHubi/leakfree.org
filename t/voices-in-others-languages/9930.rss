    <title>Voices in others languages</title>

    <description>Hello,

First, I would like to congrat all the team for this amazing hard work !
It&#39;s amazing !

I&#39;m a bit disapointed, because i thought there would be multi languages voices.

I know that making multi langages voices need times to record.

I would like to ask if there is a plan to release multi-languages voices ?

If no, do you think it&#39;s possible to replace the voices by the Half Life 1 : Source ?

Why don&#39;t trying to ask for an help from the players to create multi-langs voices ?

Black Mesa is not a mod, it&#39;s a Game, so...it will be damage and sad that it doesn&#39;t have multi lang voices :slight_smile: 

You can contact by me MP if needed,

Best regards,

Nixeus</description>

            <p>The answer would be no, anyway.  It’s too much effort and difficulty. Only subtitles will be released, as far as I know.</p>
<p>It’s about more than just replacing the audio files; there’s length of each file, and faceposing, among many other things. So, I guess people CAN try and make them, then get them into their own versions of the mod, but they will not be included with the game itself, will not be distributed alongside Black Mesa, and will not have support from the developers.</p>
