    <title>2 NPC bugs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/2-npc-bugs/9808</link>
    <description>Ok so first one is that Dr. Kleiner skips the walking animation and appears right next to Eli Vance.
I done this by trying to put a garbage can on his head and he magically teleported.
Second bug is when i found that scientist which is supposed to open the weaponry door for me the door closed before he entered and he walked right through them.
I didn&#39;t manage to get the screenshots of those.
Anyway first one might not be so important but second one may ruin gameplay as zombies or enemy soldiers could walk trough the doors you closed.</description>
