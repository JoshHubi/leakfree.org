    <title>Found an MP5 animation glitch.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/found-an-mp5-animation-glitch/14552</link>
    <description>Okay, so if you look at the hand in the shotgun or crossbow animation, you&#39;ll see how the arm is supposed to look. In the MP5 animation, if you look closely after pulling it out, the arm twists all the way around, and it looks strange. Not sure if anyone else has reported this bug or not, figured i should notify you guys.</description>

<p>Finally, someone else noticed. Also, sorry, forgot to mention: the arm only twists sometimes. The arm always looks weird, but the twisting only happens sometimes.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think others have noticed as well. It’s a very obvious mismatch, but they probably assumed that it’s not an issue, which actually is.</p>
<p>Regarding the arm twist bug, while I didn’t notice it yet, it does in fact happen, confirmed:</p>

<p>In <em>CraB</em>’s video, after he switches to the MP5 the arm twists a little. Looks pretty weird.</p>

            <p>I didn’t notice any arm twist tbh.</p>
<p>However, speaking about the arm, what I did notice is that MP5’s arm model obviously doesn’t match the one used on the other weapons. It was like this since the release unfortunately.</p>
<p>I reported this issue somewhere a while ago, hoping it will be finally fixed in CU2, but wasn’t.</p>

            <p>Note: I remember this was not the case when the retail version first released. Perhaps a later patch caused this glitch.</p>
