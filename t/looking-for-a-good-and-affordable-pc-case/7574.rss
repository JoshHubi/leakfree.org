    <title>Looking for a good and affordable PC case.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-a-good-and-affordable-pc-case/7574</link>
    <description>My PC case is quite old, small and ugly, so I want to buy a new one.

I also don&#39;t want to spend more than 80€ on a case and I don&#39;t really care about fancy led lights and external displays, just want something that is spacious, has good airflow and doesn&#39;t look like it belongs to the 90&#39;s.</description>

<p>£49.99 = 57€</p>
<p>If you want a cheapo option the Shinobi (pic) is where its at or an Antec 300. The Zalman looks like a good buy tho.</p>

<p>Damn, that is a nice-looking case.  I’m going to have to keep this one in mind when I build my new PC (soon, soon…)</p>
<p>EDIT: Does anyone sell this damn thing? :hmph:</p>

            <p>Yes it does expand to all 3 screens with no issues, and accepts the massive resolution again with no problems : )</p>
<p>I… I´m pretty sure I mentioned this but just in case, those picks where at a Lan Party, I.E. not my desk or chair  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  At home I have a nice office desk and chair, the usual leather kind.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/calhoun">@calhoun</a> freeman:</p>
<p>Well this is my second set of 3 screens as the original 3 werent all that good and since prices have gone down…</p>
<p>But basically the matrox triplehead Digital Edition box was around 270 UK Pounds, around 320€, the newer screens which are the ones depicted on the pickies are 22" Full HD LED and got them really cheap, around 120€ a pop, so 360€ (retail 220€, benefits of selling computers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ). So really, the expense in comparison to Eyefinity is essentially the matrox box, no idea how much it costs now a days, I´ve had it for the better part of 3 years now.</p>
<p>But going back to the thread point.</p>
<p>I do NOT recommend the sunbeam cube, it´s cool, looks awesome and it´s cheap but the quality of the acrylic used isn´t great and because it´s all acrylic and only 2 entry points, it overheats like a fucker, it´s ok if you´re using liquid cooling, otherwise, no.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, the reason why I prefer matrox to eyefinity, is that with matrox, the PC thincks it´s just one stupidly wide screen, so if resolution is an easy with older games, it will just center it, so it will be on, the center screen. On newer games which are not designed for widescreen, changing the FOV usually fixes this issue on matrox, except some games, unfortunately on eyefinity, doesn´t work as well, plus it still knows it´s 3 different screens so it wil ltry to adapt everything to it, which is not necesarily a good thing.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents really (plus i like nvidia more  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>

<p>Defo this. I have a 32" tv while playing on games and I had a horrid chair and pc desk. My new chair is some executive shit but the desk is so bad, to the left of my screen and barely any room to move the mouse. Yes it sucks…</p>

<p>That’s funny, I was thinking the same thing. I don’t think I could sit in that seat 2 minutes, let alone 2 hours or more.  But, that is a beautiful set up.  I have a 24" wide screen and I thought I had it all. I’m jealous.</p>

<p>I more so meant, does the Geiss settings recognize your massive resolution, and appropriately render across three monitors?  I imagine the center monitor shouldn’t be affected, I was just wondering about the wingmen <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Though Google says Geiss has no problem with multi monitors (never looked before - <a href="https://www.geisswerks.com/geiss/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.geisswerks.com/geiss/</a>) so I guess this is a moot point.</p>

<p>That’s sweet!  It looks almost like my tower. I LOVE the liquid cooled system.  Good Luck Maxey.</p>

<p>I think he more so means the cracked appearance of the middle monitor in the second picture, which to me, looks like the flash.

            <p>Coolermaster or Antec for standard look but veeery good quality, NOX or NZXT for quality with a moding look, most other things are either not made by the selling brand, or are generic made of cheap materials.</p>
<p>Also, for the one who mentioned the sunbeam cube… I´ve had one of those : )</p>
