    <title>Internet connection dropping off</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/internet-connection-dropping-off/11939</link>
    <description>Recently, the router in my house has been losing connection to the internet, seemingly at random. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my ISP, as the computer I have wired to directly to the modem does not have the issues, so I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s a problem with the Wi-Fi signal from said router. It seems to be only affecting my laptop, though it may be because it&#39;s the only computer in my house that uses the router for internet. If you&#39;re wondering why I didn&#39;t go to a tech support forum, it&#39;s because the chance of this getting answered is very slim on a larger forum, and I like this community. Since this is dedicated to a game, I know you are all probably knowledgeable about computers.

So, if you could help, it would be greatly appreciated, as I think i might be banned as a bot for my multiple disconnects/reconnects in TF2.</description>

            <p>I actually don’t have any other wireless devices with which to test. I do have some iDevices but they are unreliable, as they have their own problems… In either case, the problem appears to be decreasing in frequency, as it only happened once last session. Anyone else I ask blames it on the increased bandwidth usage caused by TF2, is that a credible theory?</p>
<p>EDIT: And to Maxey, I bought my own router. The ISP I use only provides you with a modem, and if you want Wi-Fi in your house, you have to buy your own.</p>

            <p>Have you installed any new wireless interference-causing devices recently (like a cordless phone, microwave, etc)? Or, perhaps if you have cordless phones that operate on the 2.4ghz frequency at home, is it possible that someone is talking on one of them while your internet drops?</p>
<p>It sounds like it could be a case of wireless interference, coupled with low signal strength. That, or a router problem. I assume you’ve also tested the internet with other wireless devices while it was down and found it doesn’t work on them either, to eliminate the laptop as the cause of the problem.</p>
