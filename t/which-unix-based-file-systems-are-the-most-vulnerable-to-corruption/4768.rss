            <p>By mobile DEV environment you mean a Hard Drive with Linux or Unix OS on it? In that case you would want a stable, proved filesystem which supports advanced journaling+ACLs, right?<br>
ext2/3/4 or Btrfs comes to mind then, and I wouldn’t really recommend anything else because…<br>
a) …I haven’t had so much experience with the other ones<br>
b) …the other ones have lived their lives and have been replaced by what I consider the newer and better alternatives anyway.</p>
<p>As for your question, I don’t see how anyone could answer that one since data corruption to some great extents occurs directly on the physical component (I/O error, etc…) itself and is not so much a problem that happens on filesystem level (in other words the filesystem is just a grid layed on lands already plagued by moles).<br>
Their main role is really to manage/organise your files, prevent fragmentations, allow this and that attribute for your data…<br>
still my knowledge on filesystems has its limits so there might be some filesystem features that prevent possible corruption where it’s most expected. And those I would expect to be in the one I listed before.</p>
