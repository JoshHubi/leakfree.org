Combine Prometheus with Laurel and Hardy and you have a good idea what the next film will be like if it’s about how the LV-426 ship crashed.</p>
<p>I’m seeing a new potential spinoff.  <span class="bbcode-b">The Engineers</span></p>

            <p>my only question is if LV-223 and LV-426 are supposed to be the same thing. I’d have believed it if the jockey didn’t get out of his chair and into the prometheus. The very first thing that concerned me was seeing 223 instead of 426 when they targeted the planet.</p>
<p>What I would have expected: He stays in his chair, the proto-facehugger breaks out of Prometheus and squiggles over to the crashed bomber and makes his way in and out of the dying engineer, then bursts out as a queen and shits eggs everywhere and glazes over everything to effectively set up the hive and ‘The Pilot’ piece in time for USCSS Nostromo to come by.</p>
<p>What Happened: The dude gets out of his fucking seat and goes after Shaw. He gets his ass sucked off by the proto-facehugger, now a big bullsquid thing. Shaw and David’s Head climb into a different bomber and fly off to star in Lollipop Chainsaw. Cut to a streamlined miniature of the xenomorph queen ripping out of the engineer’s chest.</p>
<p>So now the big pilot’s chair with a dead elephant guy in it doesn’t exist. So unless LV-426 is just another planet with an identically wrecked ship, the original film itself just got reverse retconned out the ass.</p>

            <p>Watched.<br>
Was kinda disappointed that a director with such attention to detail let some obvious factual errors slip through. Things like using carbon dating to determine age without the required information. Statements about distance being way off the mark. I know it’s a silly action movie…or suspense. But I expect attention to detail from Mr. Scott.</p>

            <p>heh, I don’t disagree. Here’s hoping for a director’s cut that fills in at least some gaps.</p>
<p>I mean, I can guess what scenes if any are missing, but it would be nice to see a more complete feeling film.</p>

Concept designs do not have to be followed.</p>
<p>Basically, ElephantMan = good.  Boring Cenobite = boring.<br>
You don’t need to turn a good idea into a boring idea just because Giger made a concept design 3 decades before.</p>
<p>Also, did Giger ever state that this was the guy wearing the Elephant Man suit?  Feel free to find the non-existent quote.  YOU believe that there is a connection, but that doesn’t make it so.<br>
I also believe that there is a penis monster inside of the Alien…but that doesn’t make it fact.<br>
And if there were a penis monster inside of the Alien it would still be a shit idea.</p>
<p>So yeah.  Boring Cenobite inside Cool Elephant Man is a shit idea.  Now stop joining dots to make pictures which aren’t there.</p>

            <p>My main complaint is that the whole thing just felt messy.</p>
<p>The plot for Alien seemed to work like this-  A went to B which progressed to C which in turn became D which was followed by E and finished up with F.</p>
<p>The plot for Prometheus seemed to work like this-  X went to A which became B which moved onto C which became 8 which then moved onto 9 which then turned into J which was followed by ¥ and finally by %.</p>
<p>It felt like several very good films all combined into one.  A bit like putting maple syrup, pizza, vodka and shampoo into a glass and then drinking the results.<br>
Each one works fantastically on it’s own and yet don’t quite work when thrown incoheerantly together.</p>

            <p>Giger did a lot of designs and most of them were altered or omitted completely.  So I wouldn’t take that drawing as proof that they were ‘always’ masks.<br>
Even Giger’s original Alien design was changed quite a lot for the first film.</p>

Most of the issues you cited as script problems are more than likely editing issues, mostly key scenes cut out probably due to time.</p>
<p>I’m firm in my belief that what was released theatrically was a cut up version made to appease test audiences and executives. Most of the issues later on in the film could easily be explained with a half hour pre-existing life sequence like Alien had. I’m damn certain there was one at one point.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just came back from watching it and here is my rundown of the whole film’s plot.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER<br>
SKIP THIS ENTIRE POST TO AVOID SPOILERS!</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>[COLOR=‘Black’]Starts off with a cenobite from Hellraiser…or a guy from one of the Tool music videos.  Anyway, he’s drinking some Doctor Pepper and some bad shit goes down<br>
causing him to melt.  His melting body then falls into the river and causes life on earth to begin.  So there you have it; drinking Doctor Pepper caused the creation of life as we know it.<br>
Why he decided to drink some super Doctor Pepper is something which we will never know.<br>
Next we see MainGuy and MainGirl unearthing ancient cave paintings to find the Star Gate or a velociraptor or whatever; we’ve had this as an opening scene a thousand times before.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, we’re on a space ship watching David, the only worth while character, doing cool stuff and being awesome.  This is to give the audience a standard with which to compare<br>
the rest of the characters by.<br>
Everyone wakes up, puke a lot and then give us a 15 seconds of character development (which is roughly all you get in the film)<br>
Boring stuff happens.<br>
They go into the alien space ship and somehow manage to make it look quite dull.<br>
Charliez Theron manages to be completely unlikable to the extent that even her hotness is voided.</p>
<p>I have forgotten much of the following.</p>
<p>Find the Engineer without a head. Find his head.  Big shitstorm causes them all to leave, but unfortunately they leave behind two key characters known as Asshole and Retard.<br>
By this point it’s quite clear that Asshole and Retard exist purely to be the first to die.  They get killed by a penis monster who deep throats one and sprays<br>
acid cum on the other.</p>
<p>David finds some Doctor Pepper and decides to take it back with him.  He decides that MainGuy needs a bit of Doctor Pepper to help him loosen up and stop being such<br>
an uptight Cola fan and drops some in his drink.  Unknown even to the amazing David, this alien Doctor Pepper was also be laced with some sort of date rape shit.</p>
<p>…Then I went to the bathroom…</p>
<p>I assume that while in the bathroom the date rape drug too effect and he was raped by his girlfriend/wife/mother.</p>
<p>The next day they go back to the space ship to look for Asshole and Retard.  They find Retard with a big cock down his throat and then just seem to leave him there.<br>
I guess they assumed that he deserved to die for deep throating so much.  They can’t find Asshole but really don’t seem to give a shit probably because he is an asshole.<br>
MainGuy then starts having a serious case of facial herpes and they all decide to go back to the ship. Unfortunately for them Charlize Theron put a large quantity of sand up her<br>
vagina and isn’t about to let some herpes spreading losers back on her ship.  She has some modelling gigs coming up and there is no way she can risk getting facial herpes.<br>
So what do you do when someone tries to give you a hug and they have facial herpes?  YOU KILL IT WITH FIRE!</p>
<p>Interestingly, nobody seems majorly bothered or upset that she set a guy on fire.  Empathy obviously wasn’t something the script writers had ever heard of.</p>
<p>Thankfully David makes another appearance in order to keep the audiences interest in the film from straying too far and examining the decor of the cinema walls.<br>
David lets MainGirl know that she’s pregnant.  She freaks out because she doesn’t want anyone to know that she was screwing the black guy a few months prior.<br>
Luckily for her the baby turned out to be a Tit Raping Tentacle Monster; thus her secret was safe.</p>
<p>The she runs to the medical thing and gets it cut out of her, somehow recovering from major surgery extremely quickly; thus proving that women really do make a big deal out of the<br>
whole child birth thing.  She gave birth to a Tit Raping Tentacle Monster and she was up and running about within minutes!<br>
By this point the whole plot is feeling a little messy; as though they had three or four ideas for the movie and spiced them all in together rather than focusing on one and fleshing it out.</p>
<p>Around the same time Asshole comes back to the ship.  It appears that the acid cum had turned him into Sloth from the Goonies.  Sloth wasn’t pleased with those bad people trying to<br>
steal the treasure and proceeded to break shit until eventually being run over, set on fire, shot and then shot some more.</p>
<p>Then we find out that the OldGuy isn’t really dead (which really wasn’t a surprise) and that Charlize Theron is his daughter (which was about as predictable as the sun rising in the morning)<br>
Whether this justifies Charlize Therons character existing at all is debatable, but I will edge towards NO.<br>
So the OldGuy and David and MainGirl all go back to the space ship to say Hi to an Engineer who’s been sleeping for 2000 years.  They wake him up and immediately start shouting<br>
and bitching at him.  He’s seriously hung over and certainly none to pleased with all this shit.  OldGuy then asks David to ask the Engineer for immortality or something similar, but<br>
unfortunately David isn’t too fluent in Engineer language and mistakenly asks (in Naavi) if the Engineer would like a bacon sandwich.<br>
Now, little did they know, the Engineers are all members of PETA.  We all know how unstable PETA is when it comes to bacon sandwiches.</p>
<p>So the Engineer, hungover and infuriated by the suggestion of bacon, rips off David’s head and proceeds to go Jason Statham on everyone in the room.</p>
<p>MEHHHHHHHHH!</p>
<p>Disappointment was flowing through my body as I came to terms with the fact that the film was coming to it’s end and it wasn’t going to be anything other than a very beautiful film<br>
hampered by a bad script and stupid plot.<br>
Why did the cool Elephant Alien heads have to be just a mask?  It’s a bit like taking off the head of Godzilla mid film and showing us that it’s just some Japanese guy in a suit.<br>
Even if the Japanese guy has some funny makeup it still sucks.</p>
<p>Anyway, blah blah blah.  Don’t care anymore.<br>
A ‘traditional’ Alien appears at the end, but by this point nobody gives a shit anymore.  It was almost like rubbing salt into the wound.  “Here’s what you could have had…but you didn’t.  HAH!”</p>
<p>In all, it was half an amazing film and half a shit film.<br>
It seemed conflicted in what it wanted to be.  It was too different to work as an Alien film and yet too similar to be it’s own entity.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>[COLOR=‘Black’]David studied a ton of ancient languages and deconstructed them to their roots, is what I believe he said. He probably assumed that the Engineer’s language was used as the basis for other Earth languages, so after he figured out how to read the Engineer’s language, he could presumably form an approximation of what it might sound like based on his study of Earth languages. That’s what I understood anyway.</p>
<p>Regarding the substance - More feral and powerful? How does that explain humans? If the Engineer at the beginning was seeding humans on Earth with his infected corpse, why did it make humans as they are? Doesn’t seem like the Engineers are any less violent or powerful.</p>
<p>The squid thing is another thing as well. Wouldn’t you think that by impregnating Shaw Holloway’d simply infect her as well? Maybe because the growth rate was so rapid his sperm simply became the squiddy life form without actually infecting her? Also how the hell does the squid, or the xenomorphs for that matter, grow so fast outside of a host? Where do they get energy from?</p>
<p>And I’m still wondering exactly how the facehuggers from Alien/s got to be in that ship in the first place…I really wonder if they’re going to tie that in, because I’m not certain, but I think there had to be a human to get facehuggers. Unless it was already aboard the ship, the queen would have had to have been come from a facehugger + a colonist. And that queen lays facehugger eggs, ergo somehow that Engineer ship had a human on board that spawned the original queen. Shaw maybe? She’s already kind of been shown as the mother of the species, since the squid she gave birth to made the xenomorph with the Engineer as the host, so maybe…</p>
<p>I don’t know anything of course, and I’m really hoping maybe a sequel will clear at least some of all this up.</p>

            <p>A little black text wouldn’t hurt, but I suppose enough people saw it already.</p>
<p>The black [COLOR=‘Black’]goo reconstructs the DNA and the form of the host into something more feral, and more powerful that attempts to spread itself/kill things. Hence why the transformed crew guy who’s helmet melted on his face (forget his name started murdering everyone. Shaw’s BF was in the process of changing and was killed before he could harm anyone - it took so long since he was exposed to a very small amount. It didn’t kill the engineer in the opening scene, it was in the process of changing him rapidly and he was in pain from it and fell down the falls (or he purposely jumped, not sure). Not really sure about the whole evolution thing from the squid to the facehugger to the xeno</p>
<p>Also anyone remember the deleted cocoon scenes from Alien, where some of the crew was being morphed into xenos? Prometheus’s black goo actually seems to be based somewhat on that idea which is kinda cool.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Black’]Watched it again today. Was the language David spoke to the Engineer a real language? I think he said he was studying proto Indo European or something like that. Also, what exactly does the black goo do? It turned the worms in that one room into the snake things but it made Shaw’s boyfriend sick and killed the Engineer in the opening scene. And do we know that tentacle’s relationship to the xenomorphs? I know it makes the one at the end and looks like a face hugger but why do they never get that large in any of the Alien movies?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the Spoiler alerts guys.  I wont see it for a week, so it was good to be able to skip past the spoilers.  I’ll probably just leave this thread alone though as it’s getting dangerous to read.</p>

            <p>This is an aliens universe film, and ^ is true so any reference to a predator would be nothing more then just a reference to it for fun (if they would even want to do that, I highly doubt it) the plot would never have anything intersecting into that universe.</p>
<p>I do hope it stays that way. The combined universe cheapens both IPs IMO</p>
