    <description>I need a new car soon, so I&#39;ve been doing some research on which car to buy, and as part of that I figured I&#39;d go ahead and get some opinions from teh forumz. 

What I really need is something reliable, cheap ($10k or less), and fuel efficient. Everything else is secondary. I&#39;ve got an IT job so I drive around town to clients a lot, and I can&#39;t afford to be breaking down at random times or to pay a lot for gas. And I don&#39;t wanna spend a lot of money. I&#39;ve been mainly looking at pre-owned foreign compact cars 5 years old and newer, but I&#39;m having a hard time choosing, and maybe there&#39;s some options I haven&#39;t considered. So, ITT:

-Post cars you&#39;ve owned, past or present. 
-Give them ratings out of 10 in the categories of reliability, price, fuel economy, comfort, and performance. 
-Relate anything in particular you really liked or disliked about it. 
-Say whether you&#39;d recommend it to me or not and why.</description>

<li>Excellent for those stop-and-go missions. A very forgiving vehicle due to limited size. Feels safe despite that size. Good construction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a suspicion that parents often got this car for their child who, otherwise responsible, simply could not drive well. My ex, whose vehicle it was, had not been the best of drivers. And at my university I caught a glimpse of another girl in a Mazda 3 drive <span class="bbcode-i">forward</span> in a parking space (in the wrong direction) when attempting to depart. This girl got her front wheels successfully over the concrete hump.</p>

<p>2009 Honda Fit<br>
OVERALL: 9.5/10  - I STRONGLY recommend it.</p>
<p>Reliability: 10/10 - Just a leaky tire so far which could have been from anything, but the car was nice enough to let me know one of the tires was low in the first place.</p>
<p>Price: 10/10 - This was less than $18,000 brand new and fully-loaded, though if you want a deal like that you may need some good haggling skills.  Still a damn good price for a new car.</p>
<p>Fuel economy: 9/10 - I can usually average above 30mpg over the short trip to and from school, and this is mostly city driving, but then again I know how to drive efficiently so literally YMMV.  It’s not quite into the hybrid territories (though I’ve averaged over 45mpg back home in rural MA), but it’s pretty much the best you’ll get from a full-gas car.</p>
<p>Comfort: 8.5/10 - back seats aren’t terribly comfortable but good enough, and like most small cars the suspension is a little hard, but again most cars of that size will be the same.</p>
<p>Performance: 8.5/10 - It’s a small, efficient economy car so it’s got a tiny little 1.8L engine, but it’s not SUPPOSED to be powerful, and it still gets the job done.</p>
<p>Safety: 8.5/10 - This one’s a bit tough to really measure.  Collision-wise, you have to accept that it’s a small and light car, so most vehicles out there will do more damage to you than you will to them, though the car is loaded otherwise with collision protection features.  Also, GET THE SPORT MODEL WITH VSA/NAVIGATION.  VSA (Vehicle Stability Assist) is basically the best thing since antilock brakes, and could save your life and/or your car in a situation where you start skidding.  There’s already regulations mandating all car companies to start including VSA in all their new vehicles within the next couple years because it’s so great.  The navigation system comes packaged with it, which is good for idiots like me.  The sound system is pretty sweet, too.</p>
<p>Other pros:  Insane amount of storage space.  I could probably fit just about everything I own in this car.  It’s small and convenient, but capable.  Damn good deal for the low price.  Honda continues its reputation here.</p>
<p>Other cons:  I heard that for some reason Honda Fits are prone to get their wheels stolen, so you should probably get the lock nuts and the security system.  The navigation system gets the job done, but it’s the same system Honda has been using in their cars for years, so it’s fairly outdated.  Not that big a deal for most of us, but for some it may be enough to make you buy a new aftermarket one.  Also, the car looks so nice you’ll cry big baby tears every time a little scratch or whatever happens.</p>

<p>Reliability: 8/10 (Build Quality is top-notch, but there is a shitload of lectronicz. Everything works though for now)<br>
Price: 10/10 (I mean, 10k for luxobarge in absolutely mint condition? bargain)<br>
Fuel Economy: 7/10 (Despite being a 5l v8, drinks less than BMW 330i. And much less than my old 4.3liter v8 e430 I got from my old man)<br>
Comfort: 10/10 (are you kidding me)<br>
Performance: 9/10 (Powerful engine, well balanced chassis, but still a tad heavy in the corners)</p>
<p>It appeared on ss.lv JUST when I lost hope about getting a quality w220, resulting in insta-buy.<br>
Previously sold 3 old cars to just to get a chance for buying a w220. My plot was succesful in the end.</p>
<p>Can’t drive it in England though for now, which is a great shame.</p>

Pro<br>
It’s reliable, decent on gas, and comfortable to drive.<br>
Con<br>
Engine lacks some punch, gear shift could be smoother. Styling is very meh.</p>

<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Reliability: 10/10<br>
Price: 8/10 (based on how well kept)<br>
Fuel Economy: 5/10<br>
Comfort: 9/10<br>
Performance: 8/10</p>
<p>Based on how old this car is it’s really great. It’s comfy and there is a lot of room inside of it.<br>
Parts are cheap.<br>
No electronics to worry about.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>

            <p>I need a new car soon, so I’ve been doing some research on which car to buy, and as part of that I figured I’d go ahead and get some opinions from teh forumz.</p>
<p>What I really need is something reliable, cheap ($10k or less), and fuel efficient. Everything else is secondary. I’ve got an IT job so I drive around town to clients a lot, and I can’t afford to be breaking down at random times or to pay a lot for gas. And I don’t wanna spend a lot of money. I’ve been mainly looking at pre-owned foreign compact cars 5 years old and newer, but I’m having a hard time choosing, and maybe there’s some options I haven’t considered. So, ITT:</p>
<p>-Post cars you’ve owned, past or present.<br>
-Give them ratings out of 10 in the categories of reliability, price, fuel economy, comfort, and performance.<br>
-Relate anything in particular you really liked or disliked about it.<br>
-Say whether you’d recommend it to me or not and why.</p>
