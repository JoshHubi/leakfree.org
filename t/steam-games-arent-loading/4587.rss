    <title>Steam games aren&#39;t loading</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-games-arent-loading/4587</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

Thought you guys might know more about this than anyone else... Basically the games in my Steam library don&#39;t seem to load at all on my Dell laptop running Windows 7.  I&#39;d click &#39;play&#39; and watch the &#39;now loading [game title]&#39; dialog appear, but then nothing else would happen.  I&#39;ve tried restarting, reinstalling audio and video drivers, and disabling security software.  Are there any fixes for this?  Thanks very much.

System specs:
Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.66 GHz
4 GB RAM

Games that fail to load are CS:S, GRID, Mirror&#39;s Edge, Mass Effect.</description>

            <p>right click the game in the steam library, go to properties, local files, verify integrity of game cache. you may have to do this several times for each, if still not working, reinstall the games from scratch</p>

            <p>Delete the local content, then redownload.</p>
<p>if that doesnt work, Go to C:/Program Files/Steam/Steamapps/ and delete The folders for the games that wont load, then re download.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, delete system32.</p>
