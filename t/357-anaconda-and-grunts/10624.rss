    <title>.357 Anaconda and Grunts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/357-anaconda-and-grunts/10624</link>
    <description>Hi there, 
I am trying hard to be as precise with the revolver in black mesa, as I would be in Half life 1 and Half Life 2 etc.
I just wonder if its just me or does the .357 lack its original accuracy?
It may also be that superflous crosshair irritation that occurs when you&#39;re getting shot at.

I miss sniping those grunts with it
-only way of quick-dealing with them.

I also miss double barreling them with the Spas, but that option is not existent in black mesa anymore. Because you get shredded into pieces.
Grunts feel like turrets. Just they are not turrets, they actually move and aimbot you even more. From ranges on which my .357 won&#39;t hit for a reason :C

I would like to know what you think</description>
