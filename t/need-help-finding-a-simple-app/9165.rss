    <title>Need help finding a simple app</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-help-finding-a-simple-app/9165</link>
    <description>When i was in high school (2000ish) i had this awesome little word processing keyboard. it looked like a flat typewriter but instead of using paper, it had a little lcd screen that showed about 100 or so characters. You could properly format, copy, paste, it had a build in dictionary and you could save 10Mb worth of documents. it didn&#39;t have an SD slot or anything so you couldn&#39;t just copy your files to the computer. instead, you could plug it into your computer via ps/2 or usb, open a program like Word, press &quot;print&quot; on the keyboard and the little fucker would type out all your shit FOR YOU onto the computer.

i need something like this again. if possible, in the form of an ipod app. i&#39;d like something i could use to transcribe a long document onto a workplace computer. Our computers don&#39;t have ways to read external media or read documents. They DO however recognize a simple keyboard.

i can&#39;t even think of what words i could use to describe the app to Google to find an app like this, assuming it exists. Even if i could find another device to do what i need, that would help. 

Any suggestions?

<p>Yeah, an app on your phone is not going to do you much good if you can’t connect your phone/ipod to the PC or sync it over the air, unless someone was crazy enough to make an iPhone-to-PS/2 adapter and an app to go with it.</p>

<p>No internet access though, so email won’t work.</p>
<p>What have you typed the document on already? Your home PC? Also, when you say basic computer, how basic are we talking? What OS? Is this like a 50mhz computer with a text based interface, or just like an old white box running XP or something?</p>
<p>If you can’t burn it to a CD or put it on a floppy, then my last ditch effort would be to have the document on an internal hard drive (IDE or SATA depending on what your work PC uses), then open up your work computer (while it’s off of course), plug it in, boot up the computer, and copy it from that hard drive to the computer’s boot drive. Otherwise, all I can suggest is to just transcribe it again on the computer you need it to be on. Cause AFAIK, the only PS/2 devices are keyboards and mice. Unless you can find one of those word-processing keyboard things, transfer the file onto there and then take it to work and make it do its thing, I think you’re in a bit of a jam…</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what kind of workplace doesn’t have internet but has an intranet, anyway?</p>

            <p>Told you it’s hard to describe! LOL</p>
<p>in short, i need to transcribe a long document onto a work computer that i’ve already typed and send it via our company intranet from a basic computer (at work) with no means of copying files or documents onto it. There’s NO internet access, there’s no way of accessing a USB drive, i cannot install any new programs onto the workplace computer and the document is far too large to re-type. i’m paid hourly and i have WAY too much on my plate day to day to transcribe this bitch manually so i’m looking for a way to do it quickly. it’s over 5000 characters long.</p>
<p>This isn’t part of my job. i have an open letter i’d like to share with everybody in the company but i don’t want to use company time on it.</p>

            <p>That’s what I was wondering though, why not take the documents over to the computer to transcribe them there? If there’s a reason that’s not possible, and you have an iOS device that has the notes app on it, then there should be a way to export those to something your computer can use. For example, <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5569758/seamlessly-sync-iphone-notes-to-a-gmail-account" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here’s one way using a gmail account</a>, or there are apps for PC like <a href="https://www.ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">PhoneView</a> or <a href="https://www.digidna.net/products/diskaid/buy/get-diskaid-30-off-with-techgeec?source=techgeec&amp;coupon=TECHGEEC012Q3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DiskAid</a> that can be used to get data off iOS devices. That’s all I can think of to do.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure I understand. You have a computer with a keyboard, so why do you need an intermediate step? Why not just type it on the computer?</p>
