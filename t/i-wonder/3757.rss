    <description>What do you think games would be like if Half Life was never invented, if the source engine never came?

It seems as though Valve are very respected for there source engine and was wondering what kinda games/gameplay we would be stuck with if Valve never was around.

I was also wondering if they inspired other game developers to go further?</description>
