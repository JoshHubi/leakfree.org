    <title>Oh computer gurus I need some help...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/oh-computer-gurus-i-need-some-help/13516</link>
    <description>For a class assignment, I need to compile a list of expenses on what I would need to spend, one thing I&#39;m not so sure of is how to build a proper machine that can render things from programs such as 3DSMax properly. I know how to build a gaming computer (as I have one at home that&#39;s custom built that I built myself), but this is new territory for me. Anyone got ideas on what kind of specs I should look for in terms of hardware and the like?</description>

            <p>Your immediate objective is to complete the assignment successfully,it’s not about utilizing your gained knowledge later on.</p>
<p>Focus on the assignment. Worry about the knowledge later when it’s necessary.</p>

            <p>The thing is, is that I plan on using the gained knowledge later on when I consolidate everything together to run my own studio, so I do need to know specifics.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Mink</span> Thanks, I’ll look at the info on my spare time a little later.</p>
<p>Edit: More to the point really would be what should I look for in GPUs, etc.</p>

<p>And, keep in mind, your instructor doesn’t know about all the specifics of all the things that all of the class will expound on. He/She is simply looking for proof you provide of the expense that you incur and the reasoning about it. It’s not about the specifics, it’s about how well you explain and verify why you are doing what you are doing.</p>

            <p>Why don’t you just look up the requirements for the programs you need to run.<br>
<a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-3ds-Max-2015.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/System-requirements-for-Autodesk-3ds-Max-2015.html</a></p>
<p>AutoDesk 3ds Max 2015 wants a 64bit CPU, 8 GB’s ram, and it uses 5 GB’s of HDD space.<br>
There’s also stuff about acceptable graphics cards, thinking most of Nvidia’s quadro series will work.</p>

            <p>So a render machine?</p>
<p>As far as I know, think a gaming computer, but with more RAM and maybe graphics cards.<br>
Also cooling.<br>
You’d want at least a 6-8 core 3gHz processor, maybe an SSD if it would also be used for video editing, and as good a graphics card as you can find.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Disclaimer: I do not own a dedicated render machine, nor have I built one. All my information is based off things I’ve heard in the past.</span></span></p>
