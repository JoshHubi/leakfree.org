    <title>Which computer component should be my next upgrade?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-computer-component-should-be-my-next-upgrade/7371</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
I&#39;m having a hard time deciding what to next upgrade on my gaming rig. It sucks currently, since I&#39;m still a teenager living with my parents (but I make/spend my own money! also inb4 underageb&amp;) but I have some money now and would like to upgrade it so that I can play 2010-12 fancy big-buck games like DNF (which I own but can&#39;t play due to rig limitations). So here&#39;s the important stuff about my rig:

Motherboard: [url=&#39;https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_775/P5KPLCM/&#39;]ASUS P5KPL-CM[/url]
CPU: [url=&#39;https://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=37212&#39;]Intel Pentium E5200[/url]
GPU: [url=&#39;https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-01G-P3-N945-LR-GeForce-9400-Graphics/dp/B001EH8FZA&#39;]EVGA nVidia GeForce 9400GT[/url] (with 1GB VRAM)
RAM: Super Talent 2GB (1x2GB ) DDR2-800MHz PC2-6400 Desktop Memory

So can anyone tell me what I should focus on upgrading for maximum gaming capability? (also 3D modelling since I&#39;m getting into that)</description>

<p>Yeah, sadly, I’m aware. I’m probably just gonna sell/get rid of this rig (except for this GPU) sometime this year and buy an iBuyPower without a graphics card and put this one in.</p>

<p>Looks like the 550 Ti is what I’m going for then.</p>
<p>Edit: (YES I KNOW I EDIT EXCESSIVELY) This one? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-PCI-Express-Graphics-01G-P3-1556-KR/dp/B004R9OVE6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti</a><br>
If so, that’s cheap as shit. I’m already liking it.</p>

            <p>I was really hoping I wasn’t gonna have to replace everything.<br>
Which is really why I made this thread in the first place.<br>
But like I said earlier, can anyone help me choose what to build a 600-700 dollar <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">iBuyPower</a> rig with? Their customization choices are pretty wide.</p>

            <p>I upgraded from a P5KPL-CM with an E4500 @ 2.2Ghz to a gigabyte cheap G41 board with an E2160 @ 2.2Ghz and the only difference is that now I can use 2 onboard vga outputs in addition to the 2 vga outputs from my 8800GT, with 2 screens over maxivista I could play a game on 6 screens (from 1 pc)</p>
<p>but seriously, if your board was anything but the p5kpl-cm I would recommend a new GPU, otherwise you’re better off waiting to have enough for a complete upgrade (ddr3, socket 1366, p55)</p>

            <p>Sorry man.<br>
And also, keep in mind that the EVGA GTX 460 isn’t a 150-dollar card, it’s just on sale on Amazon for that price. I think comparing actual statistics would do me better in this case, but thanks for the suggestions.</p>

            <p>I’d spend the $150 and get the 550 or the 6790. Calm down there buddy I’m typing and doing research as fast as I can on my little phone, give me a chance to answer you especially when you edit your old post. I’m trying to help you out as best I can so dont be a dick.</p>

<p>Still doesn’t really answer my question. Would it be worth spending the extra ~30 bucks to get a GTX 460 as opposed to a GTS 450?</p>

            <p>Yeah I LOVE eVGA too, both my mobo (eVGA X58 slightly) and gpu (eVGA gtx 295) are eVGA products. My wife is running the PNY gts 450 and it works great. With the eVGA branding that’s a no lose product. I’m sure others will disagree and I admit I’m an nvidia fan boy and I don’t know a lot about the AMD Radeon brand but in my experiences nvidia makes a great card.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Just looked in my newest June 2011 issue of Maximum PC and they did a whole article on the best mid-range $150 cards, they suggest either the Sapphire Radeon HD 6790 or the Zotac Geforce GTX 550 Ti AMP Edition. They seemed to  rate them about even in performace and gave them both a 8/10</p>

            <p>Well it’s looking like if I save my money all summer I’ll get around 600-700 dollars. So that’s my budget.<br>
Also, what’s the most cost-effective GPU upgrade I could buy? I have a bit over 100 dollars right now so I think if I follow Siggs’s suggestion I need to know what to save for.</p>

            <p>I’d just buy a new computer. I bought my mom and wife both pretty “decent” computers for under $550… but like I said I need to know how much you can spend and then ill price you a computer.</p>

            <p>+1 on budget</p>
<p>Note however that this doesn´t change the fact that your mobo is still Socket 775 so there´s loads of now cheap and decept cpu upgrade possibilities, also, I checked on the ASUS website, there´s a couple of bios upgraded you could use if you decide to upgrade cpu</p>

            <p>Patrick is silly for suggesting upgrading the cpu. It’s costly and not as necessary as a gpu upgrade.</p>
<p>As for what I think, I’d get a decent gpu for now, and when you have some more cash, upgrade the rest of the PC.</p>

            <p>Yeah I’m considering buying a PC from <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">iBuyPower</a>. Can anyone suggest a build? I feel like it’s too much to ask for someone to customize a rig for me on their site, but if anyone is willing that’d be awesome.</p>

            <p>That may help in the short term but even if it was relatively high-end, I’ve heard a lot about dual-core Pentiums being bad for gaming. You’re still due for an upgrade soon, though like it’s been said, it’d probably just be easier to buy a new computer, since almost everything appears to need upgraded.</p>

            <p>It seems like it was a relatively high-spec Pentium when it was first launched. It still runs everything but games really fast.<br>
Oh and I also just realized that it’s 64-bit and I’ve been running a 32-bit OS this entire time… I’ll remedy that tomorrow.</p>
