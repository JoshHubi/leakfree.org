            <p>Seriously, you should have no problems using the torrent. There are so many people seeding, it’s just a matter of time to get it. It took me 1 hour on a decent connection, but I would have easily accepted waiting 12 hours for it at this time. Just be patient and it should download steadily, if that’s the only problem?</p>

<p>Tried the torrent? It has worked just fine for a lot of people. There’s a load of <a href="https://release.blackmesasource.com/pages/download_manager.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">mirrors</a>now, one is bound to work for you.</p>

<p>That didnt work either. Ill give the torrent another try tomorrow but Steam would be the ultimate place to download it for sure without any problems. It  needs to get on steam asap.</p>
