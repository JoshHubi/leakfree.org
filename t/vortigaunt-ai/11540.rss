    <description>anyone else feels like the vorts are just dumb enemys? Every time one of them spawns they just sit there, staring at nothingness, making no effor to chase the player or pose a decent threats to the player.

Its seems like they only behavior (when not scripted) is to shot the player on sight, when not on sight, stand and do nothing.</description>

            <p>That gun is awfull, the gun in Hl had a really good presision and could kill in 2 hits, BM one has huge cone of fire needing like 10 shots to hit one time. It just looks like a reskinned combine gun.</p>

<p>That mounted gun is bugged although, because it acts as sheild and blocks all theyr attacks if right angle is found.</p>

            <p>agree, charging time is fine, however is nullified by the fact that you can practicaly dance behind corners and see them miss every shot, while standing perfectly still. A few lines of code to make them flank and cover each otehr would make them way better and more dangerous.</p>

            <p>I love that it<code>s this fast, because that makes them at least slightly challenging opponents. What I had problems with them at first was that I was trying to get headhsots with magnum on them, but they suddenly changes stance when they start charging, making head quite hard to hit, not reaction speed itself. It</code>s charging speed is what makes vorts enjoyable to fight against, as they aren`t pansies asking to be taken down anymore. Adds sense of danger.</p>

            <p>Their charge-up time is way too fast. I know it’s the same animation from HL2, but that was when they were on your side. In HL1, their long charge time was to give the player a chance to take cover, but now there’s less time to react in BMS.</p>
<p>I think it’s already been pointed out, but there’s one point in Surface Tension where you jump down a hole and there’s two vortigaunts waiting down there with no way of knowing they’re there until you jump down and no cover at all. You’re very likely to get damage as a result, which is a little unfair.</p>
<p>Other than that, I haven’t had any other issues with the vorts.</p>

            <p>I haven’t experienced anything OP states.  I’ve just played through Lambda core again in the coolant areas and they chased me up into one of the control rooms.</p>
<p>I think one issue seems to be AI consistency.  One person might play through and have all the soldiers running into walls, while another person might play through and have the soldiers tactically flanking and grenading them to death.</p>

</aside>
<p>i dont have a single problem with animations, models or textures of the vortigaunt, they are true to the universe since valve wanted the vort to look like this. But they were never meant to be enemys, their AI is too pasive. They dont attack, they respond to attacks, but never (or hardly ever) seek the player.</p>
<p>also their idle animation should change to the action idle:</p>
