    <title>[Glitch] Lantern is not working as it should</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-lantern-is-not-working-as-it-should/10026</link>
    <description>Well, when I first play the mod, i thought i&#39;ll get the lantern with the suit and stuff, buuut, through the levels I realized that the lantern doesn&#39;t iluminate &quot;environment&quot;

I mean: if I iluminate a wall with a chair by its side, the lantern iluminate the chair but not the wall or the surrounding whatsoever, it iluminates just some &quot;objects&quot; but not the whole area/environment

I have no problem with the graphics at all, and I have a Nvidia 6200 with 256 mb of ram, in fact the gameplay has been quite nice until now, and that&#39;s the only problem that I&#39;ve seen :c</description>

            <p>Iep, the “flashlight” xD, my bad</p>
<p>It’s not a big deal, but I mention it because in some videos I’ve seen that the flashlight works as it should, and in some parts of the game it’s really helpful</p>

            <p>I’ve noticed some problems with the flashlight (what you are calling a lantern, I believe) but these aren’t too bad at least for me. Occasionally the light will illuminate only parts of areas, most noticeably when it lights up the gun Gordon is holding.</p>
