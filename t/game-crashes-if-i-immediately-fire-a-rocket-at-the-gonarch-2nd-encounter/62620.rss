    <title>Game crashes if i immediately fire a rocket at the gonarch 2nd encounter</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-if-i-immediately-fire-a-rocket-at-the-gonarch-2nd-encounter/62620</link>
    <description>i was at the second encounter with the gonarch and as soon is a saw it, i fired a rocket and then the game seized up and kicked me out to desktop. im curious if this widespread or its just me. i also do realize since its in beta so it&#39;s unoptimized and i do have a good rig. normally its at 150-300 fps in this game but at times it does drop to 40fps. that&#39;s not that big of a deal. i&#39;m just glad i don&#39;t have a toaster. the main problem is if i forget about the gonarch causing my game to crash if i try to blast it immediately. i have to reload the entire game. and then if i die and have to do the whole thing again, i may get mad and try that but it crashes my game. is there a way to fix until the final product comes out.</description>
