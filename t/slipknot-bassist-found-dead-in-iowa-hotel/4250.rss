DES MOINES, Iowa — Paul Gray, the bassist for Grammy-winning metal band Slipknot, was found dead Monday in an Iowa hotel room, police said.

A hotel employee found Gray, 38, dead in a room at the Town Plaza Hotel in Urbandale, a suburb of Des Moines, police said in a statement. Foul play isn&#39;t suspected, and an autopsy is planned for Tuesday.

A person who answered the phone at the band&#39;s record company, Roadrunner Records, wouldn&#39;t give his name and declined comment.

Slipknot&#39;s self-titled debut in 1999 sold more than a million copies.

Known for its grotesque masks, the band won a Grammy in 2006 for best metal performance for the song &quot;Before I Forget.&quot; Concert industry trade publication Pollstar ranked Slipknot 18th in its Top 20 Concert Tours list in 2009.

Most of the band&#39;s members grew up in the Des Moines area.

Andy Hall, music director of Des Moines rock station Lazer 103.3, said he&#39;d known Gray for 10 years. He described him as a talented bass player who was also one of the friendliest, most caring people he knew.

&quot;This is a big blow, not only to the community of Des Moines but fans of metal at large, worldwide,&quot; Hall said. &quot;It&#39;s a devastating loss. Paul was a wonderful human being.&quot;

The station was planning to broadcast an hour-long tribute to Gray on Monday night.

            <p>I don’t care about spelling it wrong, I don’t have time to find the backwards R all the time.</p>
<p>Also, Slipknot’s earlier works were top-notch psychological horror film status.  This, the intensity and feeling behind Corey’s vocals, the rough unpolished sound, and the fast and furious lyrics made their early stuff and insta-win.  Later pieces sort of lost their edge (All Hope Is Lost), but not by much.</p>

            <p>ALL OF THEM WERE GREAT.</p>
<p>Ok, I only remember a few and to me those are the best because I actually still remember them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I don’t remember any Slipknot song because they sucked so much my brain just blocked them out of the archives.</p>

            <p>I’m a certified Maggot and I’m saddened by this loss.  However, even I must admit it won’t be hard to replace him.  Slipknot isn’t well known for awesome bass lines (unlike Korn), so if they manage to get the bassist from Stone Sour, it should all be fine.</p>
<p>Still sucks, though.  At least it wasn’t anyone else.  I think Paul was the one I was least attached to.</p>
