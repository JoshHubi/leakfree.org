    <title>Fan Crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fan-crash/9981</link>
    <description>As soon as I activate the giant fan which should launch me into the air I get hl2.exe has stopped responding. This has happened three times in a row, it seems to occur when the fan reaches a certain speed. My system is able to run Black Mesa on maximum settings perfectly so that can be ruled out.

MDMP is attached.

            <p>Check if there is a box on top of the fan. If there is, destroy it (remove it in some way) before starting the fan. This fixed it for me.</p>
