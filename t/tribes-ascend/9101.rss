This is a great game. Free, most importantly. A new FPS with great graphics.

But here&#39;s the kicker. 
Imagine playing your normal FPS... with everyone wearing rollerblades... and wearing jetpacks.....

now make it slightly more sci-fi and you have tribes: ascend.

Extremely fast-paced this game takes alot of skill to play well but its very enjoyable.</description>
