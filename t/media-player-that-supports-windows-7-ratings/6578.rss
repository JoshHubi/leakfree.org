    <title>Media Player that Supports Windows 7 Ratings</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/media-player-that-supports-windows-7-ratings/6578</link>
    <description>Hello all,

Could anyone suggest a media player (other than Windows Media Player) or WinAMP plugin that can interact with the Windows 7 media rating system (seen in the following screenshot)?  I&#39;m not sure if this is stored in the ID3 tags or not, but I guess that would make it more transportable.  I really don&#39;t like WMP, but I&#39;d like a way to tag my music on-the-fly (using these ratings) in the player so I can easily find it later in Windows Explorer when I want to burn songs to an mp3 CD.

WinAMP is my preferred music player (VLC for videos) and I&#39;d love if this feature was available.  I haven&#39;t been very successful in my Google attempts for this information, since the word &quot;rating&quot; combined with &quot;WinAMP&quot; just brings up software reviews  :frowning:  (i.e. Windows Rating WinAMP, winamp media rating, plugin, etc.)  

Thank you!  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>
