    <title>Fuck HP!!!!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fuck-hp/4841</link>
    <description>so i have had this HP pavilion dv9933cl for about a little less than a year, and its already about to die on me. On the screen there are these flashing lines that wont go away. I contected HP about it, but they wanted 400$ for a fix. And in short, i dont have $400

I tried to repair it buy applying thermal paste to the graphics chip and putting peices f copper on top of all of the chips to apply more pressure to them, hoping that that would fix my problem, it didnt. I tried reflowing the chip, and that didnt work either. 

HP had a recall on the dv9000 series, but that excluded my computer, and now im stuck with a piece of shit that costed me $700.

so my question is:

should i cough up the $400 and get it fixed, only to have this exact same problem happen to me in another year, or should i scratch together $800 for this really nice sony vaio that i found?


needless to say, im never going to buy another HP computer, ever again, EVER!!!</description>

            <p>I’ve had a dv8000, the predecessor to the dv9000 series, since March 2006 and I’ve never had any problems with it.  It’s a bit underpowered - GeForce 7400 instead of a 7600 - but it still runs source games and a number of other games just fine.  It does tend to overheat a bit.  Here’s my solution:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
I keep that thing in the fridge for hot days.  It works in a pinch.  The only other major complaint I have about this computer is that HP cheaped out and put a 5400 RPM hard drive in it instead of a 7200, so it takes for fucking ever to start up.</p>

            <p>I agree with mr.lurker here.</p>
<p>You can keep repairing it, keep throwing money at it but it’s a bottomless pit.<br>
Wouldn’t it be wiser to instead keep that money and start saving for a new rig?</p>
<p>It will take some time, but in the end it will save you a lot of trouble and money. And you’d be future proof too if you saved up like 600/800 dollars and get yourself a sweet rig with a nice new 5000 series and an i5 or so. So: More gaming power, less trouble, less money. Win-win-win if you ask me. The only drawback is that it takes some time.</p>

            <p>How often do you actually carry your laptop around with you?<br>
Really, if you’re that sensitive about price you could save up 400$ something and make a reasonably well functioning PC with Windows 7 on it that, if you aren’t stupid with, will probably last you several years. Replacing parts in a laptop you only use at home is sort of dumb.</p>

<p>I recently experienced videocard failure because of overheating. It became damn well near 110 degrees in game and around 80 degrees idle. Turns out it was because there was so much dust clogged up on the heatsinks of the videocard, it just nearly completely isolated the heat. As soon as I got rid of the dust it returned to idling at 50 degrees, and to 70 at full load and even then it doesn’t need to use full fan speed.</p>

</aside>
<p>ok i just did that, i also took off the heatskin, and applied thermal paste to the GPU, now its working pretty good.</p>
<p>im thinking though that this wont last very long, so im going to order a new motherboard for tthe damn thing. I would much rather just buy a whole new computer, but i dont have $800</p>

            <p>I am the third most powerful mole in this cave!</p>
<p>Just about all my HP experience comes from the printers, which seem to be getting worse.  I remember my old Deskjet 722c that NEVER EVER FAILED, I forget why I replaced it.  Since then, all other HP printers will just decay to uselessness within a year, and find any reason they can not to work right.</p>

<p>This reminds me of when I was much younger and decided to give my computer a good cleaning.  I noticed inside the power supply was a large volume of dust, so I pried the thing open, failing to notice the GIANT NEON YELLOW WARNING LABELS and failing to think twice while trying to bust open the welded-shut corner.  Lucky for me, I opened it, vacuumed the inside and closed it back up without touching any of the many contacts that still stored enough current to kill me.  I’ve since learned to always be more aware of warning labels around me.</p>

            <p>I would like to add my name to the list of people who’ve had less than pleasant experiences with HP.</p>
<p>Bought this laptop a couple weeks back, and to be fair I’ve not had any trouble with it.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that due to this crazy touch volume control thing about the keyboard, the volume controls go mental of their own accord, my laptop very often mutes itself and doesn’t seem to like having the WLAN enabled.</p>
<p>Apparently I am far from the only person to have this problem and it looks like the only way to get it fixed is to send it back.</p>

<p>lesson here is, buy a crappy laptop for everything BUT gaming, and build your own desktop at home for gaming.</p>

<p>That’s the appeal of Eee PCs. Pay $200 for a laptop, then go home to your $1000 epic gaming rig for pure awesomeness, and also do your work on it.</p>

<p>I’ve never personally used laptops I don’t have need for those but I’ve heard a lot of good things about Sony Vaios.</p>
<p>Edit: If you were planning to go to mac so that you could pay out the ass you might as well get an AlienWare.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a cheap gaming laptop, or ANY quality gaming laptop of good value for that matter, then the ONLY way to go is ASUS.</p>
<p>I paid $900 for:<br>
Core 2 Duo 2.8ghz<br>
6GB DDR2<br>
GTX 260M<br>
17.3" 1600x900 LCD<br>
500GB 5400RPM HD</p>
<p>Cooling is wonderful, handles Crysis on Very High, 1600x900 no AA with decent framerate. Backlit keyboard… etc.</p>

            <p>Sad thing is, I traded a really nice Dell XPS for this shitty HP. I thought the HP would be nicer since it had a nvidia geforce 8600m gs instead of a nvidia 6800 ultra. But now I relize that I should have stuck with the Dell</p>
