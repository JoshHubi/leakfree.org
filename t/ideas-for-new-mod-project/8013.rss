    <description>Hi Guys,

I´m nearing completion on my current diabolo project, currently waiting on some materials to arrive.

Thing is, a friend donated his netbook to me as he dropped it in the street and a car went over it...

...weirdly enough while the casing and screen where shattered to pieces, and the hard drive was pretty much destroyed... the mobo and ram survived, or at least looked intact when I took it all apart. So, plugged in the power, a vga cable and a usb keyboard to see if it would start, it did, went in to bios, all looked fine, run memtest and some other tools to check all worked fine and it hadnt be damaged, mobo, cpu, integrated vga and ram came up clean. Quite amazing for what happened to it really.

So,

I have a mobo the size of an itx, actually smaller, with an extension for sound sockets, another usb, and wifi card. If needed this can be discarded as I can fit the contents of a usb sound card to the avaliable socket since that extension would be gone. The reason for this is because the extension makes the whole thing the size of the netbook that´s 10&quot;. It really depends on which way I go for the mod.

Here are some options I´ve come up with:

1. I have an old 15&quot; laptop which while it works, is rather old so pretty shite power wise. But, I could use the screen, assuming it´s the same internal connection.. mold the cover of the back of screen with fiberglass or epoxy over to make a &quot;case&quot; of sorts for the mobo. This way making a working pc all integrated in to the screen. Apple Mac Style.

2. Making a new case with the base part of the mobo or use a small itx case by modifying it. Buy the cheapest SSD I can find to eliminate the last moving parts factor and make an on board computer for my car seeing as I already have a screen in it. Would have to fin a vga to rca (or tv-out) connector, not sure if they even exist though.

3. Either of the ones mentioned with watercooling and bluetooth (everythings better with WC and BT lol).

What do you guys think? Any other suggestions and ideas would be very welcomed : D</description>
