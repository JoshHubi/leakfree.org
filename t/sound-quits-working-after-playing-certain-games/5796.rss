    <title>Sound quits working after playing certain games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-quits-working-after-playing-certain-games/5796</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having this issue for a long time and I don&#39;t have any idea what it is. But certain games (Fallout 3 / NV, Call of Duty WaW (CoD4 is unaffected), and Mirror&#39;s Edge) cause my sound to quit working after I finish playing them. The sound seems to quit sometime after launch, but stays working for the game (youtube for example, won&#39;t play sound if I try to run it in the background) until I close it, at which point it stops working.

Attempting to run FNV gives the error &quot;No sound device detected; Fallout New Vegas cannot run&quot;. Attempting to open a sound file gives the error &quot;Windows Media Player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device. There might not be a sound device installed on your computer, it might be in use by another program, or it might not be functioning properly&quot;. Several other programs also tell me that there is no sound card installed.

So far the only way I know to fix this is to restart the computer, which gets gets old fast. So I figured I&#39;d ask if anyone has or has had a similar problem and/or knows how to fix it. The sound card is a a Realtek AC97 if that matters at all. So does anyone know what&#39;s wrong or how to fix it?</description>

<p>your sound card is probably not powerfull enough, and other ppl do have problems too</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Soundcards don’t really need to be powerful, however it might not be getting enough power in and of itself, make sure that any power sockets on the card are connected.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, try reinstalling an older version of the drivers. Might have been caused by a new driver update.</p>
<p>Also, does you Motherboard have built in sound? It might be conflicting or something. I don’t really know how to turn the MB’s inbuilt off if it is, but someone else here can help you with that if it is what’s causing problems.</p>

            <p>Is there any way to check? I didn’t write it down.</p>
<p>Also, the Even Viewer doesn’t say anything about my sound driver or sound card or anything like that, just an error from earlier when steam froze for a minute and another from when TF2 crashed.</p>
