    <title>BMS Update suggestion/question?¿?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-update-suggestion-question/5758</link>
    <description>Hey all. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to get yelled at or not, but I am just curious as to why the BMS team does not release an update at least once a month.

A quick twitter/Forum post:

&quot;Hey all, we&#39;re working jobs, tending to children, living our lives and working a tiny bit on BMS level design. &lt;3 Thanks for being patient!&quot;

Would be about eight thousand times better than not release any(noticeable) updates whatsoever.


I&#39;d appreciate well thought out comments (e.g., stay away from comments like: &quot;Any time the DEVs spend giving updates is time away from the mod&quot;).

 I&#39;m assuming at least one of the DEV members has enough time to type a one-two sentence twitter update once a month.



Simple updates like this could really help a lot of the people waiting for the mod, and really give new interesting topics to discuss.

With that &#39;fake update quote&#39; I wrote, I can come up with several topics about what they are working on off the top of my head, and lots of interesting/fun conversations to think about too.

This updating about 1x a year has really made so many of my close friends loose complete interest in this mod. 

Anyways, my suggestion is that the DEVs do an update a bit more often. I&#39;m not talking about media or videos, just simple ASCII. quick, efficient, painless!</description>

            <p>cuz the moderators are not bothered by it<br>
it has not degenerated into a pool of hostility<br>

<p>The point of this thread was to ask a valid question and make a few suggestions, which I did. Those questions/suggestions were answered, but this thread is still open to well-thought out discussion about BMS update/questions. Whether or not the Devs will answer them/respond, is up to them!</p>
<p>Anyways, my first post was just a suggestion but I completely understand why the Devs don’t/wont post public updates(on front webpage/twitter). The reasons Raminator gave are all valid and I do agree with them as well. I am so looking forward to the release, whenever it is. w00t.</p>

<p>Well… people run out of patience but I guess what you said is true. I wish I can hoard patience but sadly I can’t since it’s a state of mind which obviously isn’t anything physical. It’s mental and hard to keep. All of us have a leak in our heads and that’s why we ALWAYS do… a not-well-thought-out thing.</p>
<p>“Patience is waiting. Not passively waiting. That is laziness. But to keep going when the going is hard and slow - that is patience.”</p>

            <p>Frankly after a year with little-to-no official announcements or updates, on twitter or otherwise, anything new is going to be blown so wildly out of proportion that it’d take a fuckload of time to sort out the fallout.</p>
<p>So yes, while a two line summary of what’s going on would be nice, it certainly would take a lot more time than people are making out fielding all the follow-up crap.</p>
<p>While that follow-up could be ignored, that would only piss people off even more. If you make an update people feel they have a right to ask questions about what you’ve said, and then get all indignant if you don’t reply to them personally.</p>
<p>I’m personally quite impressed that any of the devs still post here at all with all the shit they’re given on a daily basis.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, and that is exactly the reason why “People (un)intentionally misunderstand or misconstrue any kind of information about progress in the most bizarre ways”, because that is all we have.</p>
<p>If we need to figure out where any information from the devs is by ourselves, then it is only natural that we also try to figure out any sign of progress/release date from that information.<br>
If you expect us to do the first, you must not be shocked that we do the latter.</p>
<p>Oh an by the way, why not give more updates, you say you don’t care what anyone thinks, so why would you care more that things will be used against the dev team and the mod? Why care about that, it’s a problem for the mods of the forum only (more trollers).</p>

<p>Although not posting updates on the main page doesn’t mean the devs don’t give news and they frequently answered our questions throughout the year.</p>
<p>This was the best way to keep us aware of BM progress without huge trolls interference (we’ve gotten pretty nice cases).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That statement, is basically a very heavily biased opinion. I’ve personally taken part in several modern and old (Beta testing)games/mods, and I’ve NEVER seen what you claim will happen, happen. Not only that, but how on earth can chat in a forum be used AGAINST the Dev team and the mod? I’m fairly sure 100% of the people on these forums would not mind and update once in a while. It is NOTHING bad, only good.</p>
<p>You go on to say:</p>

</aside>
<p>I understand your point, but isn’t that the point of a forum? To discuss a topic within forum guidelines/rules? Just as this topic was opened to ask a general question about a specific subject, the same can be done with an update, regardless if the chat is “bizarre” or “misconstrued.”</p>

<p>Again,  going back to my last paragraph, what you are saying here is fairly paranoid worrying, for no reason, no? Discussion on an ‘update’ (if you consider the above quote to be true) could be used to promote and hype up your mod as well. You are just pointing out extreme situations that I’m sure everyone can agree wouldn’t happen on these forums by members that actually have some influence in what the Dev team thinks.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a fairly unintelligent and harsh remark to make, in my opinion. I understand that people don’t always agree with one another, as we see here in this thread, but the fact is that some people see a ‘lack of updates’ as a ‘Lack of Caring’ to the public(visitors to the website/forum).</p>
<p>Even if they are told it is being worked on, the fact that none of the Dev team makes an effort to toss a simple update at least on the front webpage in over a year, is just proving that point.</p>
<p>I understand they are keeping to their original word, as to not give updates, but don’t any of the Dev team think that a year without an update is a bit…unnecessary?</p>
<p>I guess my point, and possibly a new question, is really what are the intentions of the Dev team with this mod?</p>
<p>If it is to make a mod that the public can enjoy as well as themselves, and they want to get as many people into the mod as they can, then how can doing updates not create some form of positive feedback/discussion?</p>
<p>If their intentions are to release a mod that the public can play, but they don’t really intend to get the mod out to (more) people, then that’s fine too. However, this intension just goes further to prove my point(s).</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I quoted Raminator’s post, because he was the first to post a response, is part of the DEV team, and had the most direct answers to my question(s). Keep the next responses chill and calm pleaseeee!! gogogo!</p>

            <p>You BMS guys should release a statement saying you won’t make 2010. It’s November 15th and it’s the only decent thing to do. Unless you actually plan to release before the end of the year, in which case you should make a statement saying just that. You can run around in circles but at the end of the day there’s no way around it: you’ve got 6 weeks left.</p>

            <p>Personally, I don’t see an advantage to either policy.  There’s an assload of complaining either way.  You have to pick a position, though, and BMS has picked their position.  No reason to change since the grass isn’t greener on the other side.</p>

<p>Does anyone actually give that big of a shit about Black Mesa any more anyway? I mean it’s great that it’s being worked on and I’m sure people will play it when it’s done. But most people no longer care enough to let their lives revolve around it anyway. People who have completely lost interest in it will undoubtedly come back when it’s released anyway.</p>

</aside>
<p>I read the forums every day, looking for even the smallest bit of new information. Just briefly, of course, but I do care about the mod and so do a lot of other people here.</p>

<p>I don’t get why the devs even care that shit could be used against them.  Isn’t something better than nothing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No. As I said before (possibly even in this thread), who would it satisfy? People on the forum know its going to be released (and possibly even when), so that means an update could ever only possibly satisfy one group of people: lurkers who are too lazy to come on the forums and look for themselves. Or, in another word, Youtubers. And they can’t be readily satisfied.</p>
<p>Why? Well, as soon as you give them an update like “we’ll release by the end of this year”, there’ll be a combination of flames, discontent and idiocy. They will assert that the same promise was made last year, that it means that the mod is dead and the developers are idiots. Anyone who is immediately satisfied will become less so when the updates aren’t constant, and within a few weeks we’ll be right back at this same place, but with more idiots spreading their troll around.</p>
<p>Once its released everybody will download it. If people care enough about the mod to seek out the trailer on Youtube, then they’ll care enough about it to download it when its released. People who announce that “OH BMS IS DEAD RARGH” will be shown to be idiots, just before they themselves go and download it.</p>
<p>Releasing an update over Twitter is, therefore, a zero sum game (at best). It benefits few people, if anyone, and brings with it enough negatives to (at least) negate that small gain.</p>
