    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-fixes-no-updates-just-what-is-going-on/11824</link>
    <description>New bugs are reported every day and for months I&#39;ve been stuck on the Blast Pit crash. Yet the development team have not put out a single statement concerning the many glitches the game has. There&#39;s no news post saying anything along the lines of we&#39;re working on it.

The game was greenlit a long time ago and still isn&#39;t available; Steam would be perfect for updating the game but still no joy. Why has no patch been issued? And if it has why don&#39;t I know about it? Why isn&#39;t it posted in news? It only has four threads which are two months or more old.

Could you stop being Valve and please talk? I was enjoying the game right up until that bug hit me but it would seem that absolutely nothing has been done to address our concerns. And if you do come in this thread to say that it is being worked on, a patch is planned then don&#39;t tell me post it in News, that&#39;s what the board is for.

Good day.

P.S the media link is broken.</description>
