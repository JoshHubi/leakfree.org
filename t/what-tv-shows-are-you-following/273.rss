    <title>What TV shows are you following?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-tv-shows-are-you-following/273</link>
    <description>I just realized I forgot to remake this thread! So I&#39;m currently watching Nip/Tuck Season 3 and Wildboyz (all seasons). I&#39;m also following Chuck, Reaper and Mythbusters. And I&#39;m thinking of giving a watch to Battlestar Gallactica and Doctor Who, should I?</description>

<p>Fringe - Dr. Walter Bishop is quite an interesting character, and the Observer reminds me of the G-Man. As well as House, Mythbusters and NCIS.</p>

            <p>Fringe. The acting has gotten much better.<br>
It’s funny how people on Hulu were all like “this show is not going to make it past first season” and “xfiles ripoff lol” but now they insult the intelligence of anyone who challenges the show.<br>
Well that was fast</p>
<p>Edit: I really like it, btw. Just making this clear</p>
