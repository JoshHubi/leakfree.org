    <title>Download Link Leads to a Phishing URL?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/download-link-leads-to-a-phishing-url/12434</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t seen any topic like this on the forum (if there is please provide a link). I apologize in advance if a topic like this already exists.
So far all my attempts to download the game from the link provided by the website are unsuccessful. My antivirus, Kaspersky, labels the download as a phishing url. Has this happened with anyone else with the same or different antivirus? Is there a way around this without disabling Kaspersky? 
Any and all help is appreciated.</description>

            <p>are you clicking on one of the many mirrors that show up on the download page, or are you clicking on an advertisement?</p>
<p>No matter. Go here and follow the instructions. In point 4 follow the part that directs you to gamefront. <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Installation_Manual#Installation_Instructions_.28step_by_step.29" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Installation_Manual#Installation_Instructions_.28step_by_step.29</a></p>
