    <description>Post your crazy dreams here.


I was in a futuristic world where their was a epidemic but they had a cure which made you become mind-controlled. My sister died from the disease because she didn&#39;t want to take the cure. Then years later I was contacted but a man who told me he knew the truth (played by Brad Pitt.) So me and my father (who was Peter Griffin for some reason) tracked him across the country and I had jsut caught up to Brad Pitt and it was getting exciting, then my dad woke me up  :frowning:

            <p>True. Damn my English abysmal level.</p>
<p>Turian intercourse is awkward. His rugged skin don’t help but you notice it only before and after the thing. And I understand now why he needs to calibrate things.</p>
<p>IDK if I need to see a therapist now…<br>
Damn you, you freaky unconscious. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"></p>

            <p>Last year I had a dream where I was in this courtyard fighting Combine Elites, and then I had to descend underground and retrieve some artifact from this ancient Roman temple.  Then I had to come back up and fight back out through the courtyard, but fortunately, there were these circus cages with tigers in them made out of Legos, so I just opened the cages and the Lego tigers took out all the soldiers for me.</p>
