    <title>Excellent game, several bugs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/excellent-game-several-bugs/11515</link>
    <description>Right, first off this game is a work of art, however I did notice a &quot;few things&quot; that were missed during testing - if these are already reported/fixed then my bad  :slight_smile: 

I also read the post regarding how to post the info (map name, position, screenshot) but this would take a while to do so please bear with me.

1. When you first encounter the ichthiousaur - I killed him with my crowbar (didn&#39;t loose any health, was pretty easy, (medium difficulty)),  went to the next segment (through the loading sequence), realized that I was missing the crossbow due to all of the crossbow ammo I saw but couldn&#39;t pick up, went back - the scientist at the top control room place was completely silent

2. In The place where the scientist tells you &quot;I have been tracking you, but so has the military&quot;, and you have to go through the freezer where the vortigaunts appear, I was able to exit the door of the room where the scientist is at into the cold area, and then as the door is closing quickly jump back - I was left inside the control room with the scientist, completely stuck - all of the doors are closed. Perhaps you should create an invisible wall as soon as the player exits that place?

3. In &quot;Waste Disposal&quot; I was able to protect the unarmed barney that you encounter as you exit the vent (the one that is supposed to get spooked by headcrabs and run away and get killed)  - I did this by running in front of him and killing everything (getting intentionally caught in the barnacles helped) - after that he was completely useless - didn&#39;t speak, and didn&#39;t event offer to get out of my way

4. in the level where you first encounter the female assassins, there is a dead end path/tunnel that leads downward and there is a truck at the end that is rotated 45 degrees in comparison to the road (it is at the end of the tunnel) - it is possible to jump into the space behind the truck, however after a lot of trying, I realized that I was stuck back there.

5. in the level where you first encounter the female assassins, there was a weird performance issue - at first everything was very smooth, but after reloading it.. wasn&#39;t - twas really slow</description>

            <p>Finished the game! didn’t notice any other bugs and loved it! Can’t wait for the continuation. I played it in stereoscopic 3d so it was awesome!  Maybe in another 20-30 years there will be a new remake with super awesome graphics!!</p>
<p>Remembered another bug:  In the freezer room in the office complex, you control a moving platform that is attached to the rail on the ceiling (you must first find the valve, then use it to control it),  so the female scientist was in the way of the meat that is attached to that platform… and when she came in contact with the meat (which was moving relatively slowly) she exploded.  sounds dirtier than it actually was  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>also towards the final few chapters there were no new 3d background scenes for the main menu - it just reverted to the ones from earlier levels (for example, the ones you see on the very first chapter where everyone is still happy and no aliens) - not a glitch per say and was probably done to save time</p>

            <ul>
<li>
<p>I was able to get through the part where you first acquire the rocket launcher by re-loading from an earlier save - otherwise the game would always crash (somehow helicopter - related).  Also, I had an easier time killing the helicopter because it became “distracted” and was shooting something else and was facing me sideways (looking left, from the cave) - not sure if there was an actual thing there like maybe a headcrab or the orientation of the helicopter just got messed up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also to the staff/developers - anyone actually finding this stuff useful/helpful - should I continue posting these?</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>I noticed point number 5. also. After reloading the level with the assassins it was really slow all of a sudden, until you get near the room at the back (because there was less to render?). However there were no performance problems before that while fighting the assassins whatsoever.</p>
