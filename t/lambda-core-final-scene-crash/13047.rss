    <title>Lambda Core Final Scene Crash</title>

    <description>Hi All,

This final scene just keeps crashing my rig (Gigabyte X58a-UD7, i7 950, 6GB RAM, GTX580, Win8.1 64bit). I&#39;ve dropped all the settings as low as possible and took the resolution down to 1280x800 and it still crashed.

Yesterday I took the Save down to my Mate and tried it on his rig (Gigabyte Z77X-UD3H, i7-3770K, 8GB RAM, GTX570, Win7, 64bit) and it worked fine, I then came home and put it on my fairly old Laptop, (Core2, 2GHz, nVidia Go 7600 Vid Card, 2GB Ram, Win7 64bit) and it ran ok (if a little slow) with settings on high but I did finish the game. Tonight I&#39;ve just put it on my other rig that I mainly use as Game Server (Asus Crosshair, Athlon X2 5600+, 4GB Ram, 8800GTS-512, Win7 64bit) and again it ran ok and allowed me to finish to game with the settings on High.

I&#39;ve not had problems with any other games crashing, I can play Crysis fine, I&#39;ve recently finished DeusEx HR and I don&#39;t have any other problems with the Rig that I&#39;m aware of, the one thing that does stand out as different is Win8.1.

Any suggestions?</description>

            <p>Win 8.1, eh? Maybe you’ve got some sort of driver incompatibility?</p>
