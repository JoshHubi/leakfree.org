    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/400-meh-gaming-pc-monitor/8204</link>
    <description>I was wondering If anyone could help me build a gaming PC w/ a monitor for $400, yes I know it won&#39;t be that good, and I don&#39;t mind the 30fps, I will slowly upgrade the gfx card over time, I just need to get this one for Christmas.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>just do a shitload of research and don’t buy new if you can get it used.</p>
<p>I did my first good build (intel E2160+8600GTS+2GB DDR2+ASUS P5KPL-CM) back in 2009 for less than 200$, because I stole the graphics card and HDD from BestBuy, bought the CPU and mobo for 69$ each, overclocked it to like 3Ghz and got the power supply from a friend who upgraded to a modular one(what a dumbass right?).</p>
<p>Now I have been gradually collecting better parts (went through 4 GPU’s, 3 CPU’s, 2 power boxes, 2 sets of ram and 3 mobo’s so far) and ended up with a much faster build than what I had in '09 with almost zero expenses (except for the radeon 6850)</p>
<p>I can play skyrim on 3 screens and nobody can tell me that I’ve spent too much on my PC.</p>

<p>wtf? send it back, now. this $300 PC has onboard gfx, and I can play WoW on almost Max with like 30fps (few drops in large crowded areas, and jumps to like 40fps in small areas.)</p>
<p>I can play lots of games, just not high-end ones like Like BF3 and stuff, but I can play Starcraft II, HL, almost any source game (not some recent ones like portal 2 or L4D2)</p>

<p>Yeah I guess I’m going to have to go with integrated gfx, I just really don’t like mini-motherboards, any suggestions. I’m pretty sure if I replace the card with an onboard one that has slots for future upgrades, that I can get a better PC for $300.</p>

            <p>SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</p>
<p>seriously. if you buy a computer (especially a gaming computer) for only 400$ you’ll be looking for a new one within 6 months because it can’t hanlde your games anymore.</p>
<p>that and i don’t know how it is in the rest of the world… but ever since the floods in asia the prices of HDD’s has tripled… so for 1Tb here it’s around 120€ or around 150$ at the moment… i know there are smaller HDD’s but thats almost half your budget… for only the HDD</p>

            <p>In all honesty, buying a 400 dollar computer is a waste of 400 dollars, and you’ll be stuck with what you get, and likely want to replace most if not all of the parts anyways. In my opinion, you MUST spend at least 600 or 700 on a budget rig. If I were you, I would get an i5 2400k, a decent upgradable motherboard, and at least 4Gb of RAM if there’s any money left. Later on, when you get more money, buy a psu, cd drive, tower, GFX card, and monitor. This way, you will have a nearly future proof computer that you can upgrade and will play many games on high settings. If you go with a complete crappy system right now, I just think you’ll be wasting 400 bucks. When I get home, I may even post exactly what stuff I’d get.</p>

<p>Exactly, none of those games are particularly demanding. Those computers are shit. “Around 30 fps” doesn’t mean it’s a stable 30 fps, either, it could, and probably does, constantly dip down into the single digits.</p>

            <p>I want to get a new computer with $500, but I already have good monitor &amp; I intend to carry my HDD &amp; case over from my current computer, maybe buy a second one in a while. This site is pretty good for comparing component prices, but not as much help with comparing the specs &amp; compatibility. <a href="https://www.pcpartpicker.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.pcpartpicker.com</a></p>

            <p>Your build seems to be sufficient. However, I noticed you have  a DDR2 motherboard, which is incompatible with DDR3 ram.You also forgot the PSU and DVD drive.</p>

            <p>A gaming PC for 400$ is nearly impossible, you’ll need 700 at least, if you want it to run anything more than Wolfenstein 3D.</p>
<p>Okay, now I’m overreacting, but 400 isn’t good, better get lots of cookies with that money.<br>
If I were you, I’d just ask for components or just tell him/her to save up the cash.</p>
<p>To give you an idea: I bought my PC last year. Intel Core i7, GTX460, 4GB DDR3, 1920x1080 monitor etc. It cost, if I calculate to USD, 1.173$(AKA 900 euros)(Monitor excluded).<br>
This runs Skyrim at High quality at a smooth FPS rate.</p>

            <p>You could get them to just buy a few components for you (!) and you could get the rest later.</p>
<p>But yeah, whatever you’re posting on is probably better than a $400 computer would be.</p>
