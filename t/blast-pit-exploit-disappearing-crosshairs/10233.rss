    <title>Blast Pit exploit, + Disappearing Crosshairs</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-exploit-disappearing-crosshairs/10233</link>
    <description>Found an exploit in the beginning of Blast Pit where you can get to the other side of the soupy radioactive chasm by using a barrel to jump over the rubble. It just ends as a blacked out wall at the end. I just HAD to see if there was anything back there, LOL. Carried the barrel all the way from the beginning of the tunnel, too. I guess it doesn&#39;t hurt anything tho, and it&#39;s kinda cool.

And for the second problem:

My crosshairs kept disappearing on me. This was incredibly annoying. I don&#39;t remember when it happened, probably when I went and changed weapons, but to get it back I&#39;d have to go back into the options and enable/disable the crosshairs. Also, the little check-mark for the crosshairs didn&#39;t actually correspond to the state of them - in other words, it could be checked as &quot;on&quot; and they&#39;d be off, or vice versa, there was no sense to it, and they&#39;d disappear again after a bit.</description>

            <p>Actually just finished the game yesterday, so it’s not a problem now, LOL. But I’ll keep that in mind if I decide to replay it soon.</p>
<p>With auto-aim on, it was actually surprisingly unnecessary to have crosshairs at all. I found myself picking off enemies at a distance with intuition and a little computer assistance alone, not to mention most combat in Black Mesa is at medium to close range anyway. I believe I played through a large portion of the game without even noticing it. I remember when I finally noticed something was funny, and I went in to check on the crosshair option and I thought “WOW! that really makes shooting things A LOT EASIER!” Hahaha.</p>

<p>I don’t know the cause of this, or how to properly fix it, but here is a (hopefully working) workaround</p>
<p>bind “w” “+forward;crosshair 1”</p>
<p>this will (hopefully) turn your crosshairs back on when you move forward, without needing to go back into the options. I hope you fix the issue soon enough.</p>
