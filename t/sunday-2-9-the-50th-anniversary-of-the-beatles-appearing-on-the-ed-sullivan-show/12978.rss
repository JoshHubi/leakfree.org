 Feb. 9, 1964 became one of the most memorable moments in TV history.

<p>The title has The Ed Sullivan Show in it to indicate that this was a USA broadcast event. It wasn’t expected to have any bearing on anyone else. Maybe I should have made it clearer.</p>

<p>brian jones was a very early victim… he was arguably the most talented musician in the beatles</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I found that comment to be really funny. Brian Jones had absolutely nothing to do with The Beatles. Brian Jones was the founder of The Rolling Stones and he wasn’t a ‘victim of money and commerce getting its stranglehold on the music business’. He was a victim of serious drug abuse. The Stones themselves asked him to leave.</p>
<p>There’s a video documentary made called <a href="https://www.thirteen.org/beatles/video/video-watch-how-the-beatles-rocked-the-kremlin/" data-bbcode="true">‘How The Beatles Rocked The Kremlin’</a> that some might find interesting. It’s a look at how Soviet Russia was influenced by them and it has some very interesting insights into The Beatles influence in Russia during those tense times.</p>

<p>we may have different views, but yeah, the late 50s/early 60s, along with all the awesome music of the era, was when money and commerce really started getting its stranglehold on the music business… around the time “black” music started getting into the mainstream<br>
the beatles, though obviously they made awesome music, is one of the earliest examples of great talent being picked up and totally squeezed out by corporate america<br>

<p>This WAS  their first visit and it was broadcasting live on the premiere prime time show of its era.  It was the first time that the general U.S. public had seen them and, for many, were made aware that they even existed. The impact was huge and instigated the first ongoing discussions about music between the generations.</p>
