    <title>Formatting Software?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/formatting-software/615</link>
    <description>Is is possible to format your hard drive with a formatting software? What i want is something that will format everything on my hard drive except the WINDOWS and other drivers folder (i know that all i have to do is use a Windows CD to format my PC but i dont have one).

Btw does installing and removing lots of video games screw up the PC? It seems that the only problems i get from all the computers i use is the hard drive needing to be replaced.</description>

            <p>You can reinstall windows later, formatting is fun, I do it at least 20 times a week because I fix computers alot.</p>
<p>Last time I’ve formatted my primary partition was in 2005 when I still didn’t know I could boot windows on a new PC without reinstalling, and I didn’t know how to clone my partition to a new drive along with windows and everything.</p>

<p>Formatting is completely erasing, no way to ‘partially format’. If you want to clean out your computer, get a Windows CD, use a serial number and reinstall windows. Sure you have to get your drivers and such again, but it’ll speed up your computer.</p>
<p>Installing and uninstalling can clog up your registry and hard drive if it’s a poorly designed game/installer, which many are.  It won’t screw up your computer, but it will slow it down. Try defragmenting your hard drive, that should fix some issues, and get Auslogics registry cleaner, that can help too.</p>

            <p>fail. Format ALWAYS wipes out everything, that’s usuallly the purpose.</p>

            <p>you know what formating is, right?<br>
you cant’t format a HDD without deleting anything.<br>
because of this I have several partitions.</p>
<p>HDDs have a limited life time and saving an deleting stuff is limited too.<br>
I don’t know exactly how much read/write cycles a HDD can have in its “life”…</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
btw, next time post in <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/forumdisplay.php?f=10" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“Help&amp;Support”</a></p>
