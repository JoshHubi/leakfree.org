    <title>A Blast From My Past.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-blast-from-my-past/332</link>
    <description>A blast? Or maybe more of a sucker punch...

Back in 2007 I went to Las Vegas for a couple poker tournaments that I won my way into. A few people that I know won their way into the same set of games, so we all had a blast hanging out in Vegas together. It was lots of fun.

After we got back, I hooked up with one of the women from our group (we will call her A), had sex for the first time since 1995, and then took her on a date a week later where I realized things just wouldn&#39;t work out well if I tried to continue things. In December a few of us went to Atlantic City for some other tournaments. A was supposed to be one of us but didn&#39;t come along. A week later it was Foxwoods with the same group, A still not included even thogh she was directly invited. A month after that and she wasn&#39;t talking to me at all, not even to say hello. She stops playing cards at the same places as me as well.

This weekend I was in Atlantic City for another tournament on Sunday afternoon. I drove down on Friday night and played a hell of a lot of poker at the Showboat casino preparing for the big game. On Saturday evening I suffered a big loss with K-K versus A-A, so I got up and left the table. I walked over to the Taj Mahal to see where the tournament would be held and get an idea of the lay of the land. Satisfied with my excursion I headed back to the Showboat to get into my car and head to my hotel outside of town. I almost stopped at a restroom, but decided against it. I was parked on the 4th level of the garage, but someone else in the elevator was on the 3rd floor, and I was just up the ramp so I decided to walk up to my car. It was here that I saw A driving up the ramp. She rolled down her window and said something I couldn&#39;t here over me saying &quot;hello&quot; and all of the other ambient noises. I found this strange, and called my sister to tell her about it while I was getting dinner and back at my hotel room.

After eating and watching some TV I drove back out to the casino. I passed where A had parked on my way up to the 6th floor that I was now parked on. I won $80 that round, and at around 1:00am I headed out to get some sleep. On the way to my car I walked passed all of the slot machines to see if A was around so that I could find out what she said in the garage. She wasn&#39;t there so I took the elevator up to the 5th floor to walk up the ramp to my car and see if hers was still there.

Sure enough her car was there, and so was A with some guy. And here is a transcript as close as I can get it:

A: &quot;What are you still doing here?&quot;
Me: &quot;This is where I always come to play cards when I&#39;m down here.&quot;
A: &quot;What were you doing wandering around the parking garage earlier?&quot;
Me: &quot;I wasn&#39;t wandering. I was on my way to my car like I am now.&quot;
A: &quot;Don&#39;t you have anything else to say to me?&quot;
Me: &quot;I don&#39;t know what else [i]to[/i] say to you...&quot;
A: &quot;Well I&#39;m alive still. You can see that, can&#39;t you?&quot;
Me: &quot;Yes. Good for you.&quot;
A: (cutting me off) &quot;No it&#39;s not! It&#39;s not good for me.&quot;

I forget the next couple of interactions, but she introduced the guy she was with and explained that she was at a concert at the casino. I assume since she was alone when she got there that she met the guy there. I was worried at first that he was a new boyfriend that would try to kick my ass, but as things went on his smile grew wider as he enjoyed the drama playing out in front of him. I think I liked R. He seemed like a good guy.Anyway...

I walked up to my car wondering what had just happened. I think she was grabbing some overnight stuff to have fun with R. She wasn&#39;t there anymore when I got back the next morning. I feel like I should call her to see if she is ok, but I also feel like I shouldn&#39;t really be interacting with her anymore either. She is almost definitely unbalanced and needs help, but I don&#39;t think she would accept it if anyone offered.

My god what a mess...</description>

            <p>My advice is to stay away from women who use men as tools and find a woman who has brains and beauty. Also she should not be an insane psycho lady like Typhoid Mary  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Ha, fair play.</p>
<p>I’ve seen girls that manipulate you in subtle ways that they are most likely not even aware of themselves. There are two that I’m thinking of in particular and they seem confused and often angry themselves, and it often results in a love-hate relationship. There are also girls that send out really confusing messages in a strange attempt to draw attention to the fact that they need attention. It’s really the female equivalent of built-up male aggression.</p>
<p>Both types of girls seem to cry a lot in my experience, and they sound like the sorts of traits that are present in your example, TheeGoatPig. With those sorts of girls, you usually end up getting more hurt. I’d say stay friends if you can, as there’s nothing to say that she’s a horrible person - she just has some relationship issues and is most likely confused herself. It sounds as though she can be quite controlling and always wants to be in control of other’s feelings. If she really wants to go further with you, I’d say let her do it herself - it gets the pressure off you and leaves you hassle free, but don’t put too much hope in her for anything other than friendship.</p>

<p>The only sensible reply so far.</p>
<p>There’s no way any of us are qualified to make a long distance diagnosis on this one on the information we have. All I can say is to agree with shifty that it might be a good idea to call her and see if you can work out what the hell it’s about. If the answer isn’t simple and easily resolved then you’re better off just putting her completely out of your mind and letting someone else worry about her.</p>

            <p>I dont know about you but whenever i meet someone from my past that i had a fall out with my heart panics a bit.</p>
<p>If you want my advise here it is: you should be a decent person and call her and ask her whats wrong since you did date her.</p>
<p>I had a long distance relationship with this girl. Her last email said that she had alot of drama to deal with and that she’ll email me back when all the drama is taken care of. After about a month i received no reply what so ever and my sister and friends said that if she was really serious about the relationship she would have emailed me even when she was going through the drama. I go on to her myspace page and i find out shes dating some guy. I understand that long distance relationships dont work out so im cool with that and i want her to be happy but im upset with the fact that she didnt tell me about it and break it off in front of my face, instead of making me wait like a dog waiting for its master to come back home.<br>
Me and her had alot in common so i hope we could still remain friends. The last email i sent to her said how i wanted things to be now, just only remain friends. I havent gotten a reply back from her since but you know what? You should always do the decent thing and try and to make any relationship have a good ending instead of an ugly and awkward ending.</p>
<p>So TheeGoatPig if i was you i definitely call her and ask her whats wrong. If she lies and says nothing, force her to get help. She wont be thankful but that is something only you can be proud of having done.</p>

            <p>A blast? Or maybe more of a sucker punch…</p>
<p>Back in 2007 I went to Las Vegas for a couple poker tournaments that I won my way into. A few people that I know won their way into the same set of games, so we all had a blast hanging out in Vegas together. It was lots of fun.</p>
<p>After we got back, I hooked up with one of the women from our group (we will call her A), had sex for the first time since 1995, and then took her on a date a week later where I realized things just wouldn’t work out well if I tried to continue things. In December a few of us went to Atlantic City for some other tournaments. A was supposed to be one of us but didn’t come along. A week later it was Foxwoods with the same group, A still not included even thogh she was directly invited. A month after that and she wasn’t talking to me at all, not even to say hello. She stops playing cards at the same places as me as well.</p>
<p>This weekend I was in Atlantic City for another tournament on Sunday afternoon. I drove down on Friday night and played a hell of a lot of poker at the Showboat casino preparing for the big game. On Saturday evening I suffered a big loss with K-K versus A-A, so I got up and left the table. I walked over to the Taj Mahal to see where the tournament would be held and get an idea of the lay of the land. Satisfied with my excursion I headed back to the Showboat to get into my car and head to my hotel outside of town. I almost stopped at a restroom, but decided against it. I was parked on the 4th level of the garage, but someone else in the elevator was on the 3rd floor, and I was just up the ramp so I decided to walk up to my car. It was here that I saw A driving up the ramp. She rolled down her window and said something I couldn’t here over me saying “hello” and all of the other ambient noises. I found this strange, and called my sister to tell her about it while I was getting dinner and back at my hotel room.</p>
<p>After eating and watching some TV I drove back out to the casino. I passed where A had parked on my way up to the 6th floor that I was now parked on. I won $80 that round, and at around 1:00am I headed out to get some sleep. On the way to my car I walked passed all of the slot machines to see if A was around so that I could find out what she said in the garage. She wasn’t there so I took the elevator up to the 5th floor to walk up the ramp to my car and see if hers was still there.</p>
<p>Sure enough her car was there, and so was A with some guy. And here is a transcript as close as I can get it:</p>
<p>A: “What are you still doing here?”<br>
Me: “This is where I always come to play cards when I’m down here.”<br>
A: “What were you doing wandering around the parking garage earlier?”<br>
Me: “I wasn’t wandering. I was on my way to my car like I am now.”<br>
A: “Don’t you have anything else to say to me?”<br>
Me: “I don’t know what else <span class="bbcode-i">to</span> say to you…”<br>
A: “Well I’m alive still. You can see that, can’t you?”<br>
Me: “Yes. Good for you.”<br>
A: (cutting me off) “No it’s not! It’s not good for me.”</p>
<p>I forget the next couple of interactions, but she introduced the guy she was with and explained that she was at a concert at the casino. I assume since she was alone when she got there that she met the guy there. I was worried at first that he was a new boyfriend that would try to kick my ass, but as things went on his smile grew wider as he enjoyed the drama playing out in front of him. I think I liked R. He seemed like a good guy.Anyway…</p>
<p>I walked up to my car wondering what had just happened. I think she was grabbing some overnight stuff to have fun with R. She wasn’t there anymore when I got back the next morning. I feel like I should call her to see if she is ok, but I also feel like I shouldn’t really be interacting with her anymore either. She is almost definitely unbalanced and needs help, but I don’t think she would accept it if anyone offered.</p>
<p>My god what a mess…</p>
