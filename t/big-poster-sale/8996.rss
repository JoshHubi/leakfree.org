    <title>Big poster sale!</title>

    <description>Not as in many...as in, dimensions. Really need to shift these pronto, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t think of putting them here. But who want&#39;s some massive cinema banners?

They&#39;re 5ft. x 8ft. £30 each.

They&#39;re made of vinyl plastic, not paper, the inglorious basterds posters come with the black mounting poles that go through the top and bottom. All posters have minor marks from being rolled up.</description>
