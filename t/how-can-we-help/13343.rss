            <p>From time to time, there are announcements for openings posted to this forum.  If you don’t see an announcement for an opening available, the team is not looking for help at this time.  If an announcement does occur, they will provide information about how you can submit relevant material such as a sampling of your work.</p>
<p>Until that time, please just remain patient.</p>

<p>I work in the corporate world. There I bite my tongue and try to be diplomatic because well, my job depends on it. Outside of that I don’t tolerate stupid shit snarkiness like that, especially when I offered my time with no strings attached. Not really sure how that would make egotistical a good adjective for me. Egotistical implies arrogance, not the total lack of patience to deal with random ass-hats.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>. I’m not too old myself, but I’m old enough that at times I am quite bothered by the level of immaturity and general selfish, assholish behavior from the gaming community in general. For that and for other reasons, there are times where when someone asks me what I like to do in my free time, I either omit games or put them at the very end of the conservation in passing statement.</p>

<p>lol</p>
<p>Anyway, I think they might be fine in the technical skill department. They have a <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/forumdisplay.php?f=67" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">jobs section</a> which they post in when they need someone, but right now it’s only VAs. I mean, the game has been in dev for 8 years, they accumulated quite the team.</p>

            <p>Damn man, what’s your problem? How do you know I didn’t know anything about it until last year? That I didn’t have the skills necessary to help until now? That I didn’t have the time to help until now?</p>
<p>Really, it shouldn’t matter what my motivations are at all. Even if all I wanted was to be able to tell people I helped with the mod then it still shouldn’t matter. If someone volunteers to help you out without asking for anything in return then how can you be mad at them? Even if I said all I knew how to do was shit in a bag, then you would still say “thanks for the offer, but we don’t need anymore help in that area”. Yeah, I would like to see the rest of the mod get released sooner, so what? The mod team is a very talented group of people who worked on this for a long time without any expectation of payment or anything. It sounds like they might end up being to sell it on Steam now, and that’s good for them, but I wouldn’t expect any of that money.</p>
<p>It would be different if I had called them all no talent hacks and said the mod would have been done 6 years ago if they had me on the team but I didn’t. Sounds like it is time for you to go attend some anger management courses at a clinic.</p>

            <p>Just be patient and try to get up-to-date on the latest happenings.  Every once in a while the team may ask for new members but that’s it.</p>
<p>If you think you have skills that may help the development of the game, just post your work in the Sector C forums and if your work is impressive enough, the team might contact you.</p>
