    <description>Has anyone else been having stuttering every couple minutes when playing? It&#39;s been happening to me on both SP and MP.. Other than that I get a solid 150+ fps, so I doubt its my computer not being able to handle it. Turning on cl_forcepreload 1 helped a bit, but its still pretty bad.</description>

            <p>I get a lot of stuttering as well. Mostly when looking around quickly, when coming to/around a corner, when opening doors, or when a new map loads. I’ll try disabling those settings and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Edit: Hey, it seems to have worked so far! I haven’t had any noticeable stuttering!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>But now I’m curious, is disabling those things responsible for the fact that when I blew up Magnusson’s casserole, no smoke appeared? O.o</p>
<p>Edit: There’s still a bit of stuttering, but it’s not frequent or bad enough to make it unenjoyable.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I experience random stuttering regardless of what’s happening on screen even with those dlight settings disabled. In both multiplayer and single player. I’ve experienced stuttering during the tram ride into Black Mesa and during firefights in MP (among other times, both those two scenarios contrast each other).</p>
<p>GTX 970<br>
i5-3570k<br>
8GB RAM</p>
<p>I get between 100-150 fps constantly (apart from one random issue in multiplayer which I posted) yet it still stutters even with 150 fps. I believe the tram right jumped over 200fps but still stuttered.</p>

            <p>Disabling those 4 options didn’t help at all. It seemed to happen less often for a while, though.</p>

            <p>We’re fairly convinced this is a dlight related issue, and we are hoping to sort these particular issues out for the next patch.</p>

<p>There are performance issues with explosion and muzzle flash dlights which we did not experience in all of our testing. We are looking to resolve them as soon as possible in a patch.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can try a couple of things if you have stuttering or poor FPS:</p>
<p>From the main menu go to “Options,” click the “Black Mesa” tab, and uncheck the four boxes under “Performance.”</p>
<p>These options are called “Enable DLight Manager”, “Enable Muzzleflash DLight”, and “Enable Battery DLight”.</p>
<p>See if that helps.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d be wary viewing this solely as a explosion/muzzle flash issue, I have the same exact issue, however explosions/ muzzle flashes by themselves wont stutter me, but inconsistently appear to do so.  I’ve also only tried the multiplayer with the current BMS released, so this might some how be related to multiplayer only in some convoluted way, which might explain why you wouldn’t have had much problem with this during testing.</p>

            <p>I have this problem as well.</p>
<p>I have a bit of an older system but I’ve never had issues with any other game stuttering like this.</p>
<p>I noticed it on the tram ride and really hit when I hit big viewing window just before the descent to the open area, I didn’t get this around the helicopter area, and didn’t notice this at all during the resonance cascade.</p>
<p>I don’t notice lag on any recent games, I didn’t notice stutter anywhere else so far and it just seemed to be on the tram ride.</p>
<p>System:<br>
Core 2 Duo E8500<br>
4 GB Ram<br>
2 x 465 GT’s in SLI<br>
Running 1920 x 1080 all on highest settings.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve noticed the stutters usually happen every time a player is gibbed by an explosion, as well as very brief stutters when a player is ragdolled.</p>
<ul>
<li>nVidia GTX 660</li>
<li>i5-3570K ~3.4GHz</li>
<li>16 GB RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>Tested it with graphics both set to as low as possible, and as high as possible (with v-sync toggled on and off.) I have also tried setting cl_forcepreload to both 0 &amp; 1 with no change.</p>

            <p>I can confirm that I noticed the same on my end.</p>
<p>It’s not a fps problem either (60 fps + VSync). It’s just stuttering.<br>
I haven’t tried forcing Triple Buffering with RadeonPro yet. (It might fix it)</p>
<p>My PC:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Motherboard: Gigabyte Z77X-UD3H</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Memory: 8 GB - G.Skill Sniper 1866mhz</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">CPU: Intel Core i7 3770@4.4GHz with Corsair H60 2013 </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7970 (SAPPHIRE OC with Boost Edition) </span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">SPU: Creative Sound Blaster X-FI Titanium HD</span></p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Ok, so, enabling Triple Buffering on RadeonPro fixed the microstering I was having.<br>
So, guys, try that and see if it works for you.<br>
Of course, TB includes the use of VSYNC, so you’ll have a little bit of input lag.</p>

It’s the same sort of stuttering that’s been a problem in most source games, but it doesn’t happen to me in any other game. Also, it always happens right before the game changes maps, but at other times as well.</p>

<p>Entire game is smooth for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps post your computer’s specifications? Random stuttering every now and then could be memory thrashing, knowing your specifications would help the developers check it out.</p>
