    <title>Guitar Hero: Why the sequels?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/guitar-hero-why-the-sequels/918</link>
    <description>As a person with no experience of pretending to know how to play a guitar while in actuality pushing five buttons, can someone please explain why there are about a million guitar hero/ rock band games out there. Surely the concept cannot move beyond adding drums and vocals, as well as perhaps some songs that should just be sold as songs via iTunes.</description>

            <p>I’d buy a Led Zeppelin rock band/guitar hero game.  Jimmy Page would translate very well to those games.</p>

I shit you not. There’s Guitar Hero 5 and BAND Hero… in the same year.<br>
And people think EA is a whore.</p>

            <p>They re-release them as new games as opposed to DLC’s because you make more money that way. I own a couple guitar hero games, and I’m bored of them. Rock Band is fun, like Kaze said, because it’s a party game.</p>
<p>There are a million of them because they include new songs and such, which provides something new to each game.</p>

            <p>There are minor additions and improvements made from game to game, and there are special features offered with some of the specific Guitar Hero editions, like Guitar Hero Metallica that comes with an additional harder difficulty level for the drums that requires the use of a second bass kick pedal.</p>
<p>Rock Band is way better than Guitar Hero, for a myriad of small reasons that would sound inconsequential if I listed them here, but make a real difference when you’re playing. The Rock Band series also allowed you to export (most of) the tracks from game one into the sequel, giving it a mammoth list of songs to play even without downloading any. It makes for great fun at parties.</p>

            <p>The average person will buy anything that gets a ton of press coverage. Look at the Wii!<br>
Luckily, you can buy the games separately from the guitars and drums etc. So it’s not like they’re making you pay for everything all over again.</p>

            <p>Because people love pretending they can be a rock star when in reality they’re 150 pounds overweight, hairy, and have stains from last week’s Ben and Jerry’s that came about during their Dungeons and Dragons session.</p>
<p>Honestly, Rock Band is fun because it’s a party game and you can play with friends. Guitar Hero as a single player thing gets extremely boring.</p>
