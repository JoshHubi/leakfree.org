    <title>Xbow acceleration?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xbow-acceleration/10904</link>
    <description>I have no idea if this was brought up, but I&#39;m having a serious issue with the crossbow&#39;s zoom function. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not really a glitch, but it sure is a problem. The aim acceleration doesn&#39;t decrease when you zoom in, resulting in the view snapping everywhere when you nudge the mouse even a little bit. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s a way to compensate for this (I mean, it was in Hl2, but still), but it would be greatly appreciated if someone came up with a solution. I haven&#39;t checked recently, but I think the suit zoom and magnum zoom may have the same problem.</description>

            <p>Yes, that crossbow zoom acceleration needs to be fixed. Suit and magnum zoom works good, just crossbow is off.</p>

            <p>IIRC there’s console var for mitigating this one, you could set it to anything you like - it is notcheats protected. I don’t remember the exact name of the var and have no access to the Source-engine based game ATM but you could do “find zoom” in console and it would be  eazy to guess which var controls sensitivity multiplier for zoom.</p>
