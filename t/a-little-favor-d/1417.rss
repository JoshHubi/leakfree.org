            <p>I think I saw mention of that somewhere, but I didn’t have the whole story. I missed the whole fiasco, but I’ve been hearing mentioning of it for a while now.<br>
I’m not sure who was brought up, but I can’t think of a lot of forum members who seem mod material. Wasabi I guess, I’d say Geekofalltrades, but he isn’t around much anymore. TheeGoatPig possibly…I dunno. It’d have to be someone who has a level head to put up with all the crap around here, and who has been around long enough to know what is going on. It’s a short list.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
OH, and they would also actually have to WANT that kinda crappy job too. Haha. Have to be cordial and responsible on an online forum? Nuts to that! JK  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Nothing at all in recent memory. Ok, ok, before this gets out of hand, let me go check the mod forums.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-b">only </span>members we’ve ever discussed in there since the most recent forum crash are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the guy who pretended to be Kalashnikov</li>
<li>some troll who I now don’t remember very well who kept signing up new trolling accounts under different IPs (I think ‘fuck’ and ‘bored’ were him)</li>
<li>Neskwik/Failcrash (and only right at the start, where I asked Ram to remove his signature privileges after he kept ignoring me telling him to get a smaller sig)</li>
<li>Hot#s</li>
<li>and Kaze and the guy he banned during his brief mod stint.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Admitting it is the first step on the road to recovery.<br>
I’m not actually an asshole. I talk the way I type but people take me too serious at times…because it reads serious. But it is never intended to be. It’s just my way. There isn’t one person on these forums I wouldn’t go out of my way to assist in technical stuff ( which is about all I’m good for  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  )</p>

<p>It wasn’t me that banned him anyway, although Ram asked for input from the whole mod team before he did it and none of us cared to argue for his remaining here.</p>

<p>I very nearly did ban him when he was at his worst. He’s been fairly restrained for some time though.</p>

            <p>Okay with or upset about the banning, it shouldn’t really matter. It’s a ways back now, and it’s not going to change anything now is it?<br>
I never really paid too much attention to hot#s, because the topic of his threads were a little inane to me, but if he was banned then he was banned. That’s just how it goes. We are all just guests here, and fighting about stuff we don’t really have the right to isn’t going to change things is it now?<br>
Sorry, don’t mean to sound preachy, but how about we let it go?</p>
