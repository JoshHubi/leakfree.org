    <title>Anims and skin assistance for my first mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anims-and-skin-assistance-for-my-first-mod/63179</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m a new mod creator. I&#39;m currently making my FIRST map for my FIRST mod but I&#39;ve made GMod maps before though. I&#39;m trying to get a scientist to sit down but it&#39;s not working. When I tried with the actbusy, he doesn&#39;t move. When I tried with scripted_sequence, he just magically disappeared. also, while we&#39;re in the topic of scientists, How do you make his skin the Pre - Resonance Cascade skin?</description>
