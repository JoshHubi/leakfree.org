    <title>Forgetful Bullsquids</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/forgetful-bullsquids/12281</link>
    <description>I could be wrong, but I don&#39;t think anyone else has posted about this yet... 

Is it just me, or are Black Mesa&#39;s Bullsquids extremely forgetful? In Half-Life 1, shooting at one and then ducking behind a corner would get the Bullsquid to follow you around that corner and tail-whip you into a pile of gibs. But in Black Mesa, doing the same thing results in the Bullsquid instantly forgetting you were ever there, turning around, and returning to whatever it was doing before it saw you. Seems like kind of a serious AI issue... Even if they don&#39;t follow you, it&#39;d be nice if they at least continued looking in your direction so they&#39;re ready with their spit attack.</description>

            <p>I don’t have much problems with BM A.i. with the exceptions of the mentioned Bullsquids, but that’s more like a frequency of behavior and obviously the HECU, dunno if the AI is too good or too bad 0_o</p>

            <p>They need to update the bullsquids, make them charge at and stalk the player more. Also I believe a pain/dying sound that was present in HL1 isn’t in BM, kinda takes away from the feeling that they are more than mobile turrets.</p>
