    <title>MP:spawn only on 2 entities</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp-spawn-only-on-2-entities/14586</link>
    <description>After the release of the latest patch I noticed that on my map in BM my friends and I spawn only in 2-3 different points while the spawn points on the map 12.
I saw an example of spawn on the maps and did the same but we have to continue to spawn 2-3 points. Its bug ? Or strong random ?
As well as the top 10 on the server  writes non-existent  nicks with a huge number of kills.  How i can reset stats?</description>
