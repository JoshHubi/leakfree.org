    <title>Black screen after setting up native resolution (1080) and restarting the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-screen-after-setting-up-native-resolution-1080-and-restarting-the-game/13936</link>
    <description>I can fire up the game and mess with the graphic settings as much as I wish, restart it and everything will be OK.
But if I select my monitor native resolution (1920x1080), the game will work, but if I restart it, all it&#39;ll show me is a black screen, with the background menu music playing.

The only way I&#39;ve found to play the game at 1080p is to remove the videoconfig.cfg file everytime before I start the game, then manually change the video settings prior playing

Config:
Core i5 2310
GTX970
Windows 10 Build 10071
8GB RAM</description>
