            <p>May be, if we look at their attack analytically we can see them deploying the following tactics (very similar to specialized police units and similar forces):</p>
<p>(0. Sneak up to the enemies position as far as you can)</p>
<ol>
<li>Disorient and confuse:<br>
Here they used their psi-like abilities to emit a flash-bang-like wave blinding everyone and even knocking them to the ground.</li>
<li>Access the room:<br>
if possible through improvised holes in the hull of the building (if safe to do so), else through doors and windows.</li>
<li>Supress and terminate resistance, immobilizing the enemy (cuffs or shots): Again done using psi-powers.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point we see Eli has been affected by psi-powers (see 1) but he has NOT been pinned down, meaning he is either not deamed to be a threat (which Eli made the advisor immediately regret bashing him with a lead pipe old-school style), or the advisor is not capable of pinning down more than two people.<br>
If you look at the feeble brownish ray in the air resembling hands and holding Gordon and Alyx down it may be some form of physical/spatial limitation.</p>
<p>Well you know the rest, arrogance seems to be one of their weaknesses btw., as the first advisor didn’t even wait for the second one, and no guards were positioned outside.</p>

<p>If you watch closely during the ending Eli appears almost unaffected by their telekinesis. Albeit with a certain amount of difficulty, he appears to be able to move reasonably freely within their influence before one of them knocks him to the ground with its mechanical arm, and even then it has to pick him up manually. Maybe the Vorts gave him special training, or something? If so, it’s possible Gordon might get some of that too.</p>

<p>Incidentally, since we’re on the topic - the stalkers appear to have a lack of cognitive abilities. A source of Advisor chow, perhaps?</p>

<p>Besides the “Kill”-animation looking as if Eli’s brains were being sucked out of his head, nobody survives such a huge blood loss directly from a cracked skull AND an uncontrolled fall from about two meters in mid-air. I mean, that was a fuckin blood-FOUNTAIN coming from the back of his head when the adivsor was attacked by dog.</p>

            <p>They are the original Combine.  Their dependence on technology has reduced them to limbless slugs.  It’s why they create synths to fight for them.</p>
<p>And Eli is dead.  It was a really emotional scene, Valve wouldn’t dampen it by having him survive.</p>
<p>Plus it SUCKED HE BRAINS OUT</p>

            <p>…I was actually serious.<br>
For example, the advisors have strange symbols on their necklace-thing. This indicates they have a language. That combined with their power over the rest of the combine leads me to believe they are the oldest of the combine.</p>
<p>The only one that’s been killed so far was killed by dog. Dog seems to be the most powerful entity in the game. But how is freeman supposed to kill one?<br>
(I’m presuming there’s a showdown in ep3)<br>
The only way I can think of-- unless there’s a new gun-- is distracting the advisor while dog kills it. I also think they can be killed by vortigaunts, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I also counted 27 advisors, minus the one that was killed. The voritgaunt seemed to mention that he could kill them, however, so who knows?(Presuming valve keeps to the number in the citadel)</p>
<p>Technically, we don’t KNOW eli’s dead. Alyx was stabbed with the hunters…things, but she’s okay.</p>
<p>I really don’t know why their tongues look like dicks. I just really don’t. I’m guessing that was a joke in valve that went too far.</p>

Yes, one of them killed Eli<br>

Sneaking pass their psychic awareness of your presence, like Dog did at the end of EP2.</p>
