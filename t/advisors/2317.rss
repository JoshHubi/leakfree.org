    <title>Advisors</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/advisors/2317</link>
    <description>I notice that whenever advisors are mentioned it is implied that they are the combine - they&#39;re the founders&#39; lineage, the leaders and the beneficiaries.

I&#39;d come under the impression that the advisors were more a tool of the combine empire than the leaders of it. What a strider is to combat, and a stalker is to operating those energy ball slots, I figured an advisor was to thinking and planning. Synths built for advising.

Is there some evidence supporting the common assumption I&#39;ve missed, or are we just taking stabs in the dark here?

-

On a related note, its assumed that the Combine are occupying earth in order to access its natural resources. I know a lot of the original pre-leak storyline suggested this - the air exchange, for example - but I didn&#39;t notice any abuse of the Earth&#39;s resources in the release, canon, version (I&#39;m open of course to refutation of this, I could easily have missed something).

Is it possible that rather than the Combine being deliberately antagonistic, Breen isn&#39;t lying when he portrays the Combine as trying to lift humanity up, improve its&#39; functionality, and eventually bring it into the Universal Union? The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as they say. I certainly saw more evidence of the Combine&#39;s efforts to that end - the production of stalkers and troopers for example - than to the recovery of resources.</description>

<p>I don’t know you, but I think the concept art tells us the ice would be one think layer. It would be impossible for anything to swim in there.</p>
<p>Further more, I’d like a garg synth more, because it’d be more like a worker synth, used to melt the ice and stuff, which would actually be more interesting to see than another combat synth. Th garg should have some combat purposes though.</p>

            <p>I wonder why so many people seem to stumble on the fact that there are a handful of Advisors on earth…that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re valueless.</p>
<p>I’m of the opinion that the Advisors are the original progenitors of the Combine - the “starting species” that controls it all. And that’s just it - they’re an entire species. It’s not so far-fetched to say that they have classes - a ruling class, a lower class (though still obviously above everything they control.)</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Advisors on earth are probably something of overseers fairly low on the Advisor chain of command. Something like captains in the military, for example. They’re still members of the Advisor species, but they’re low enough in the chain of command that putting them into the field doesn’t matter very much.</p>

<p>I think that would fall under doublethink more than it would Newspeak, although Half-Life 2 seems to have some of that as well. Calling themselves ‘Civil Protection’ while acting in a way that does the opposite; definitely doublethink.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how boring Half Life would be if we were given the full background about everything as it happened, 100% of the time? Imagine, after seeing Gman for the first time, being told, in detail, everything about him, his motives; everything. It might be okay, but I doubt he’d be nearly as memorable as he is now.</p>
<p>I don’t think it would be a stretch to say that most Half-Life characters, enemies, and locations would be significantly hurt if this method of storytelling wasn’t employed. Valve knows how to ease the player into something, storywise and gameplaywise. I’d go as far as to say it’s one of their strongest points.</p>

<p>Ah, science-fiction and worm-like leaders are never far apart (Dune, nuff’ said). I never really understood why the Combine would station multiple Advisors on Earth. If they were really that important, why would you need like 20 of them? It seems that if your inter-dimensional trip was a one-way affair, you would leave your most important assets behind to facilitate the logistical aspects of the invasion. I always liked to think the Advisors were hive-minded, slaved together to amplify their latent telepathic and telekinetic abilities.</p>
<p>It was awfully shortsighted of the Combine to invent a teleportation device that can only go to other dimensions and not to different points in the same dimension. If a bunch of monkeys with MIT grads could figure it out in a few decades, how the hell could an advanced inter-dimensional empire like the Combine not invent it first? Plot holes, plot holes…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you think about it, on their original planet they probably had different resources which needed different ways to use than what we have, resulting in different areas of investigation and expertise than humans.</p>
<p>It’s not a plot hole at all, how can you expect a race from a different universe to act the same way we do?</p>

<p>Or, it’s that Lost and HL are actually related and the Island taught them how to do it. After all there’s that station in White Forest…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>No, but seriously, I agree. It could easily be explained by the humans making accidental discoveries (or, discoveries directed by the G-Man, after all he did bring them that crystal), or else the resources were more available.</p>
<p>As far as the whole “Advisor” title thing goes, I wouldn’t read too much into it. If my theory is correct then they could’ve just taken the title to themselves as a mean joke (as in, ha ha, yeah we say we advise you but we’re really ruling you). I mean, just look at the name Civil Protection…</p>
<p>When we find out the whole story it’ll probably be a good story, but it could be quite simple for all we know. Whatever it may be, the true appeal of Half-Life, what gives it that special ominous feeling, is being kept in the dark. Not knowing what’s really going on and having to learn things in tiny steps makes it infinitely more intriguing than just being told upfront. You could make the worst plots great with this method, and make the best plots mind-blowingly amazing.</p>

<p>I don’t know if I would call that a plot hole, maybe our scientists went in another direction of investigation than the combine. Its entirely possible our scientists were able to come up with something that the combine hadn’t figured out yet.</p>

            <p>Ah, science-fiction and worm-like leaders are never far apart (Dune, nuff’ said). I never really understood why the Combine would station multiple Advisors on Earth. If they were really that important, why would you need like 20 of them? It seems that if your inter-dimensional trip was a one-way affair, you would leave your most important assets behind to facilitate the logistical aspects of the invasion. I always liked to think the Advisors were hive-minded, slaved together to amplify their latent telepathic and telekinetic abilities.</p>

<p>Now that once again turns the tables. It seems that having the <span class="bbcode-i">full</span> quote clarifies quite a lot. But anyway, it’s still impossible to tell wether the Advisors are in fact the absolute leaders of the Combine, or just a high ranking leader of their forces in other worlds. Or <span class="bbcode-i">whatever</span> they may be.</p>
<p>But I’m starting to think that this whole “Advisor”-title maybe doesn’t mean anything at all. I mean, to me they seem to act as observers, being nested inside the citadel, keeping close watch on Breen and all that. And as I said now that the citadel is gone they need to gather the Combine forces and do what  they can to repair the broken link to their homeworld.</p>
<p>Gah, I don’t know what to think anymore. From now on, I’m just going to see them as space-maggots of doom.</p>

<p>It seems to me that whatever form of travel they have, it is nowhere near as fast or advanced as what Aperture Science had developed.

            <p>Ah, I never noticed that “tennants of advisorial assistance act”-thing.<br>
I had a theory that, even though their title is “Advisor” they could still be the rulers. It’s extremely hard to describe what I mean, but I’ll try.<br>
If the Combines have no single ruler, but rather a council, then none of the members of the council would be the absolute ruler, and therefore no one would have the title of “king” or “emperor” or something, but all of the “councillors” would argue about what to decide. In a way they would “advise” eachother.<br>
Or how about this: Who is a kings nearest man? The advisor. And without a king there are only advisors left, and they have to decide instead.<br>
Now this doesn’t exactly describe my theory, but it’s close enough I guess.<br>
And man, did I use many quotation marks.</p>
<p>But after reading what you said, this theory seems very illogical. “Tennants of advisorial assistance act” indeed suggests that they are just that: Advisors. If they are merely assisting by giving advise, then there is probably at least one higher rank in the Combine hierarchy.</p>

            <p>Actually <span class="bbcode-i">I</span> always though otherwise. Has anyone ever noticed a couple of little but interesting pieces of info/evidence that suggests that the advisors are not the original combine, or at least, not at the top of the combine pecking order? firstly is the name “advisors” which implies they are “advising” something (combine emperor?), and deepneing this is the overwatch voice in episode 2, when it refers to advisors (assumedly advisors anyway) as <span class="bbcode-i">“tennants of advisorial assistance act”</span>. maybe the advisors are a species (or group of the original combine species) that was given some specific task of “advising”, (whatever that may mean) the point being that this suggests they may not be at the very height of the combine hierarchy.</p>

            <p>…And in the middle of the debate, I return. First time to post on the new forums. It’s hell about time.<br>
Anyway. I agree completely with Orpheon. To me it seems highly likely that the Advisors in fact are the very original “Combine” species, and therefore also the ruling hierarchy in the Combine empire (lets assume that they have an empire of sorts).<br>
It is possible that there is a lone ruler too, but I’m going to stick with the theory that the Advisors have some sort of ruling council.</p>
<p>And about that “leaders don’t go into frontline combat”-thingy.<br>
Well, they did not until things were getting extremely bad at Earth. The Citadel at C17 was destroyed, the link to the Overworld was broken, and the remaining Combine forces needed to be united under a leader of sorts. As Cecil (heh, the vort that helps you in ep2) says, the Advisors are gathering and uniting the scattered Combine forces.<br>
And the human Overwatch has disappointed them so many times (as Breen points out in hl2), so it is possible that they want to take more direct action, by leading the Overwatch forces personally.</p>
