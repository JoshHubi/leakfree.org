    <description>Hey, everyone.

So this map I&#39;ve been slaving away at for months is randomly shitting on me when I cross a certain threshold in the map. It also doesn&#39;t seem to be outputting a minidump to help me diagnose the problem, either. Is there a newer place to look for crash dumps?
As to what is causing the problem, I think possibly fade distances on some of my level&#39;s props might be fading simultaneously to the point where there&#39;s some kind of buffer overflow, but I&#39;ll have to do a lot of tweaking to confirm. Dropbox of map available on request.</description>

            <p>Nothing sweetheart. I just think it is adorable the way you begged for help, but then apparently discovered the answer yourself and tried to cover it up by having a mod delete it?  :s hrug: Sounds EXACTLY like something <em>I</em> would do. (call me the delete queen)<br>
We should be best friends.</p>

<p>So this map I’ve been slaving away at for months is randomly shitting on me when I cross a certain threshold in the map. It also doesn’t seem to be outputting a minidump to help me diagnose the problem, either. Is there a newer place to look for crash dumps?<br>
