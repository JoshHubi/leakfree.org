    <description>So I&#39;ve downloaded [COLOR=&#39;Green&#39;]Opposing Force (on Steam) to step into the boots of Adrian Shephard once more. The game runs perfectly... well, except for the music tracks.  I think they&#39;re op4 tracks all right, but they&#39;re being played in the wrong order (compared to the original cd version) so they&#39;re kinda unfitting, and even disturbing.

I menaged to download a track pack, consisting 20 music pieces, all from Op4, but I don&#39;t know where to put them (( I tried and searched for OP4 music directory, I think I even found it and emptied it for a start, but then Half-Life&#39;s musics began playing ingame. I thought I&#39;ll fall down from my chair right away). 

I gladly see this issue has been fixed in steamed [COLOR=&#39;Blue&#39;]Blue Shift , but OP4 still has it.  I hope someone here knows how to fix this.</description>

            <p>I’ll try and see where I downloaded it. On the other hand I didn’t notice the update on HL.</p>
<p>EDIT:  A link that seemingly worked for me. <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/download/dm3antvyvlccvve/ChrisJensen-HalfLifeOp4-PLM.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.mediafire.com/download/dm3antvyvlccvve/ChrisJensen-HalfLifeOp4-PLM.zip</a></p>

            <p>I made a post about the tracks returning a while ago. No one commented. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>As for this “Track Pack”, can you show where you got it? Or is that against Fourm Policy?</p>
<p>One other thing: They updated Half-Life so that the music plays through map trasitions, but they haven’t done that yet for Op4 or BS. Any ideas why, or does anyone know how to fix it? Or maybe it’s supposed to do that…</p>

            <p>Thanks for the routes, that’s a start  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">     Too bad for now I only remember only a part of the music tracks’ right position.  But I just might puzzle it out.</p>
<p>By the way, if for you BS and OP4 starts, but with a black screen for a menu, than just run the games with the -nofbo    launch command included, and it’s fixed.</p>

            <p>steam/steamapps/[steamname]/opposing force/gearbox/media/</p>
<p>that’s where the files go to replace the music</p>
<p>at least, it was before steampipe, now it might go in steam/steamapps/common/half-life/gearbox/media/?</p>
<p>I have BS and OP4 uninstalled because they no longer run thanks to that update</p>
