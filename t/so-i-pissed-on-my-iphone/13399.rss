    <title>So... I pissed on my iPhone...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-i-pissed-on-my-iphone/13399</link>
    <description>Yeah, probably not the best of forums to be posting this on, but I&#39;m new - wanna buildup my post counts, and what better way then sharing with the world that I&#39;m a fucking dumbass! Right?...

Anyways, I take a fuck ton of downers for sleep every night. Usually a mix of Xanax + Restoril (Temazepam), with a small dose of Benadryl. Well I took a bit too much last night and had a blackout. Somewhere during that blackout, I pissed all over myself and where did my phone happen to be? Well right against my dick of course. So I have a couple questions that other nerds could probably answer for me...

First off, my phone keeps trying to turn itself off. (I don&#39;t blame it, if my owner pissed on me, I&#39;d probably want to do the same). But seriously, every time I touch the screen, the &#39;Drag to shutdown&#39; bar appears! It literally won&#39;t let me access it. I&#39;m assuming the good &#39;ol rice in a bag trick should draw out any moisture in the phone. But then I still have another problem...

My phone smells like piss. And I don&#39;t mean that you can only smell it when you hold it up to your face. No, no no... I mean the smell of piss is just radiating off my phone. You stand within 5-feet of it, and it smells like someone who&#39;s only eaten asparagus for the past year has pissed on it. So besides the moisture. How the fuck can I get rid of foul, piss-smelling, phone problems?

And before you ask - I&#39;m fucking serious about this. Help is appreciated.</description>

<p>Which I don’t… And having taken apart iPhone’s before - they’re nearly impossible to reassemble 100% correctly. So before I do that, I’m going to try rubbing the outside with a mix of baking soda and Hydrogen Peroxide. Since both of those are odor eliminators.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, I’ll try soaking it in isopropanol - but, like I said above I’d rather avoide taking the damn thing apart since I hate reassembling devices with microscopic screws.</p>
<p>Another good idea would also be… don’t piss on your phone <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>Soak it in isopropyl alcohol (while it’s turned off, mind you).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My first thought too. Also make sure to use a 99% type if you can. While isopropyl alcohol is non-conductive, common rubbing alcohol from most stores is around a 70% mixture, and while I think it might work, that other 30% might be conductive. If that’s the case, if your phone isn’t completely dry when you turn it back on, it could cause significant damage.</p>
<p>You might need to repeat a couple times with fresh alcohol to make sure the piss is all gone.</p>

<p>In theory, you should be able to open it up and clean it out with something; damp paper towel, Q-tip, whatever the appropriate tool is. In theory.</p>
<p>In practice, you should just get a new phone.</p>
<p>Also, I’m pretty sure the rice-in-a-bag method is something you’re supposed to do ASAP.</p>
