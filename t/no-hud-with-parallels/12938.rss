    <title>No HUD with Parallels</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-hud-with-parallels/12938</link>
    <description>Hi,

I know this issue has been raised before but I&#39;ve tried every solution offered and there&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m running BMS on a late 2009 Macbook Pro with Parallels Desktop running Windows 7 and can&#39;t get the HUD to appear at all.
I initially thought it would just take a little while to raise the immersion but by now it should most definitely have appeared. On top of this there&#39;s no crosshair or text overlay of any kind.

I&#39;ve tried the input command &quot;cl_drawhud 1&quot; in to the Dev Console, tried every screen resolution and full FOV, tried running both fullscreen and in a window and made sure the TrueType fonts are in the right place. Nothing. Are there any other solutions to this issue because it doesn&#39;t look like it was ever solved.</description>

<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> get the HUD the moment you pick up the HEV suit.  I’m assuming you picked up the HEV suit.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m nearly up to Blast Pit now. Still no HUD.</p>
