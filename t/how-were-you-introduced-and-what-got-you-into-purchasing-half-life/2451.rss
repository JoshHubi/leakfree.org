    <title>How were you introduced and what got you into purchasing Half-Life?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-were-you-introduced-and-what-got-you-into-purchasing-half-life/2451</link>
    <description>Basically, write how you came to know of Half-Life 1 and what got you into purchasing it? How did Half-Life change you as a gamer and as a person? Extra points if you write it into story format.

Well, as for me, I went into K-Mart one time to buy a PC game. I didn&#39;t own any consoles, other than my N64, but I was interested in PC gaming. As I browsed through the items, my brother, 4 years older than I was chose Galaga, the popular space-shooter, but a 3D remake of it for the PC. I noticed Half-Life and liked the picture of a man holding a shotgun, being 9 at the time, and studies the pictures provided at the back of the product. Guns and aliens! What more fun could a kid ask for?  The only other FPS game I ever played was Goldeneye, but this game killed that visually and it looked awesome. My brother nearly, just nearly, convinced me to purchase 3D Galaga, but I held strong until he gave up. I had bought Half-Life, and boy did I not know what great of a game I got myself into. Even as a kid, I enjoyed the fact that you were going to work one day and you, the player, caused this massive disaster which kills a lot of people. Half-Life changed me as a person and how I viewed games, movies, even music. I know longer cared about mindless action, but with the 4+ years I grew up playing Half-Life, I realized how beautiful the story melded together.

The NEXT FPS I would buy on PC, after Opposing Force and Blue Shift, was Hal,, after hearing so much about it. But, after playing Half-Life and with it&#39;s awesome storyline, I would not see Halo as such an epic game. It was purely combat, no puzzles involved. An action game with great graphics, at least at the time, but the story failed in comparison to Half-Life. The immersion in Halo was fine, but you felt insignificant, in my opinion. In Half-Life, as Gordon Freeman, you freed an enslaved alien race, destroyed the Nihilanth and felt as if you really beat the game. 

What about you guys?</description>

            <p>I had been thinking about buying Portal after finally getting DSL from Dial up and watching trailers of Portal. In one of the related videos was Freeman’s Mind, I thought they were funny so I wanted the game. After finally installing steam from the Orange Box, I bought Half life: source and beat it, then remembered about the Orange Box and beat the other half life games. Liked them, so I bought Blue Shift and Opposing Force.</p>

            <p>I heard of  half life for a long time but when I was 11, I found a copy of the GOTY edition of half life one and counter strike source. counter strike source didn’t work but I was just so addicted to half life that I played it two times in a row  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . Then l8ter in my sad life I got Half Life 2 but I wasn’t as interested in it as much as the first one for some reason. But then I got Garry’s Mod and that gave me more appretiation for Half Life 2 and made me addicted to Half Life 2 and the episodes. And now I’m sitting on the computer 24/7 waiting for Black Mesa and Episode Three…</p>

            <p>I’ve heard about the Half Life series long before I got it, but I didn’t hear MUCH about it.</p>
<p>I mean, it really started way back when I started playing Gunman Chronicles, and someone mentioned that it ran on the Half Life engine. Years later, I come across screenshots of Half Life 2, and stumble across a Wikipedia article about it. I only skimmed through it quickly, not understanding most of what I was reading(and events in the game turned out quite different than what I thought them to be.) Of course, I stuck with the game series I already had, like Quake and Unreal Tournament.</p>
<p>And then, one day in the summer of 2007, I was at my uncle’s house. I knew he had Counter Strike on his computer, so I went to play that. When I booted up his computer, I noticed the Half Life 2 logo boldly sitting there on his desktop… Just daring me to click it. I followed suit, and was completely drawn in. When I got home, I bought the game, and it was the first time I ever played it through completely without using cheats. Some time afterwards, I got Garry’s Mod, and then there’s a lot of other history you might not care about.</p>
<p>Three years later; I have Half Life 2 and it’s expansions, Garry’s Mod(which is so loaded with shit, it takes up over 40 gigabytes.), a bunch of mods that take place in the Half Life universe(Riot Act, MINERVA, and Dangerous World to name a few.), and a huge shitload of stuff that I’ve modded into the Half Life games themselves.</p>

            <p>Around '98 or so, I gave a buddy a ride to some hole-in-the-wall computer repair place out in the middle of nowhere to pick up his pc or something.   We started talking to the guy about how cool Unreal was and he says, “Oh yeah? Check this out…” and fires up Half-life and lets us play for a bit - holy shit, the intensity drew me in like no other game has or ever will.  The part during the resonance cascade when all you hear is heavy breathing and suddenly the vorts light up in front of you - I nearly shit myself!</p>
<p>I immediately went out and bought a copy.  My machine back then was an E-machines with a Cyrix 266 processor with a Voodoo2 video card - lagged like hell during the Blast Pit and any time there was a chopper flying around, but it was pure awesomeness.</p>

            <p>My Uncle first introduced it to me; he described it as a cross between Doom and Myst. I thought it sounded pretty neat, so he got me a copy of the game.<br>
I first installed it on a Pentium 1 machine. The framerates were horrible, very choppy, but at the same time I can remember thinking the game was so cool and different from anything I had ever played that I didn’t really care.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time there was a place where you could pirate games without the complicated hacking it requires today, this land was called the upper 90"s and lower 00’s. Our sory begins with a childs name who will not be menioned (me). After his fathers work he would watch him play on windows 98. Occasionaly he would wlak out of the room and leave (me) with zombies coming owards Freeman, ( I am five at this point). (Me) The boy would get so scared that he would have to shut off the computer by removal of the cord in the back, and that was how he (I) came to know half-life, (the first scary game for a five year old).</p>

            <p>When I was below 10, my teenage cousin used to give me old CDs he never used anymore, and one of them must have been half-life.</p>
<p>I was intrigued by the Black Mesa logo on the disc, and I installed it immediately. Ah, the good ol’ WON days… so much easier to install games on multiple PCs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Saw that pic of Gordon Freeman which looks like he just bitch-slapped Alyx. Had no idea what is was and got back to playing Vice City and shooting off prostitute’s heads. Got the Nvidia free HL2: DM and Portal: The First Slice thing. Thought deathmatch was awesome and my friends forced me to buy Counter-Strike: Source to play with them as well. I then got Garry’s Mod, then was pissed that I was missing loads of objects because I didn’t have this thing called “The Orange Box”. I knew about Half-Life by that time, so played it through, then bought the Orange Box and the rest, they say, is history.</p>
