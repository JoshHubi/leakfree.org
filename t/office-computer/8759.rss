    <title>Office Computer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/office-computer/8759</link>
    <description>My dad wants a new office computer and his boss is willing to shell out 500 for it. He&#39;s commissioned me to do pick it out. He won&#39;t be doing anything strenuous, just web surfing and word processing, and all that on a 1024x768 CRT he insists on still using. I plan on assembling a barebones and installing windows 7 professional (his boss insists it be professional) and a wireless card from his old desktop.

Here are the four options I&#39;ve found so far:

At the moment I&#39;m leaning towards computer 4.</description>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. I was under the impression that all those are simply hardware bundles not pre-builts. Your replies (crypt and loony) seemed to imply otherwise, am I mistaken? I’m willing to deal with any tech difficulties that may arise. Also, I’m off to college next fall so if shit goes wrong it’ll be harder for them to make me deal with it.</p>
<p>I think I’ll buy option 4. My dad wants a fast computer, so I’ll get him a fast computer. It’s the bosses money anyway, so I’m not too concerned with price efficiency.</p>

            <p>I’d just build one yourself, it’ll cost much less, and probably work better, overall. But, also, as CPU stated, that’d be a good thing to think about, as that’s very true. You’ll become the “tech guy” who knows how to solve the problems, and “oh, you’re a workers son, it’s free.” so, if you don’t know how or simply don’t want to, then pretty much any of those will work great based on what you say he’ll be doing. I’m leaning towards 4, though, as it’s both the cheapest you provided, plenty of RAM, plenty of HDD space, and looks neat, heh heh. But if surfing and word processing are it, you might wanna save the dude some money and go even cheaper, because those all are way more than enough to get the job done.</p>

            <p>Wow, it seems everyone here is being pretty profoundly unhelpful.</p>
<p>I would stay away from pre-builds, as they’re usually more expensive. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/o7qbp/build_ready_budget_parentfriendly_pc/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here’s</a> a build that I made earlier this year for my friend’s mother. Very easy to put together, and works like an absolute charm.</p>
<p>And bear in mind that all of those prices are in AUD, so it’ll obviously be cheaper (and you can likely now get slightly more advanced tech at an equivalent price).</p>
<p>As for the wireless card, I’d just get a motherboard with Wifi built in, given that its one less thing to worry about (as well as it likely being better than the card you have to work with, if the other components, like the monitor, are anything to go by). I didn’t worry about it for my build, but there are definitely options.</p>

<p>Very generous. It’s a very informal situation, the boss and my dad are close friends etc. so it’s not anything so serious as that. I’m expected to, and will, do my best to deliver and will probably only take at most like 50 bucks or less regardless of the final price of the computer.</p>

If a drink gets spilled on it, if there’s a power surge or brown-out, if a bug get’s on it, if there are network issues, if the monitor actually just wears out, no matter what…you’ll be expected to take care of it because you were the one who built it so it’s your fault.

<p>I always mention that I give a 1 year warranty on software only, and charge 50$ for 2 years.</p>
