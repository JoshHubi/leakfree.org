    <title>weapon binds</title>

    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m an experienced hl2dm player and I play with 1 key binded per weapon.

For example :

[b]bind a &quot;weapon_357&quot;
bind b &quot;weapon_pistol&quot;[/b]

etc....

I dont want 1 key per weapon slot such as :[b] bind a &quot;slot4&quot;[/b] because it&#39;s slower to get the weapon you want.


The issue is some weapons of Black Mesa have the same name of the weapons of hl2 when some have not.

For instance : [b]&quot;weapon_357&quot;[/b] is still [b]&quot;weapon_357&quot;[/b]
But in BM :[b] &quot;weapon_pistol&quot;[/b] is now [b]&quot;weapon_glock&quot;[/b]

I have found the name &quot;glock&quot; in the /models/weapons but for the other weapons sometimes it does not work.

So if someone has a list of all the weapons in console, I would be grateful to share it. It could be added to the wiki too.

Thx !</description>

<p>in most source games, you can find out weapon names by typing weapon_showproficiency 1 and selecting that weapon. It will print the weapon name to the console, and your “proficiency” with that weapons (which is bugged)</p>
