    <title>Valve Women</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/valve-women/7385</link>
    <description>As some of you may know, I’m a female.  I play (more than any other) Valve games.  In recent years Valve has included these strong female characters in their action games.  Naturally, I like to play the female character except for in the Half Life series where it’s impossible.  So, Alex in HL2 is the strong female personality in that game. 

I’m just curious; out of Alex from Half Life 2, Zoey from Left 4 Dead, Rochelle from Left 4 Dead 2, and Chell from Portal, who do guys find most interesting?  Not in a romantic way. But which female character do you like and why? This is not a contest……..I’m just genuinely curious.  :slight_smile:</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I found Alyx to be a phenomenally well developed character. A big reason of why Episode One was so great is that she was by the player’s side almost the whole time and never felt out of place or artificial. She was there by Gordon’s side, she shot things accurately, etc. like a good AI should, but what really gets her to stand out is how her character develops over the course of the three segments of the series so far. Half Life 2’s focus is more on developing the world, the universe, what happened after the Combine hit. Alyx didn’t get very much screen time compared to her role in the Episodes, but she set a good tone for the universe. She was there to discover things with the player, point out stuff in the environment to further enhance the setting, and dish out snark in little tidbits. I got really invested in the character- I felt like I could relate to her as a person rather than as just another NPC in the game.</p>
<p>Zoey in L4D1 is a fun character- She’s a strong lead like Alyx but tends to enjoy herself more, with much funnier dialog. (“I call zombie bullshit!”)</p>
<p>Rochelle I haven’t logged enough hours in L4D2 to comment on her one way or the other, but I seem to recall Jessica Cannon (Sin Episodes: Emergence, not by Valve but on Source regardless) being a better player companion than her.</p>
<p>Chell is just the player’s avatar, like Gordon. So we can’t really comment on her character because <span class="bbcode-i">she has no characterization.</span></p>

<p>I still don’t understand why you think that means he didn’t understand Half-Life’s story.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason being, because it doesn’t take much to realize how developed Alyx is. He must have missed that. Because if he understood the story, he would have understood what Half-Life is all about, and where Alyx fits in, and why she is so developed. He makes it seem as if he’s only watched youtube videos of it. I’ve actually played Left4Dead and Zoey was just another character played by another person. A playable NPC in a way. This whole discussion is deviating from the original poster’s intensions.</p>
<p>We’re arguing over Zoey and Alyx when the original poster expected people to list more characters from VALVe’s games. This isn’t a: “Who do you think is better, Zoey or Alyx and WHY?” thread.</p>

<p>Thanks, man.</p>
<p>Geekofalltrades that’s your business if you connect with Zoey more than Alyx. Really, I’m guessing that’s why no one agreed with you.</p>

            <p>^ lol, “Purging my stupidity.”</p>
<p>I just checked your Steam profile, and you don’t even <span class="bbcode-i">own</span> Left 4 Dead.  You own Left 4 Dead 2, but have spent a third of your time in-game playing The Parish as Nick.  Have you <span class="bbcode-i">ever</span> played a Left 4 Dead campaign or met Zoey?  I don’t see how you’re qualified to judge her character when you’ve barely had any contact with her.</p>
<p>The fact of it is, the dynamic nature of Left 4 Dead and the background given in the comics mean we get a much broader look at Zoey than we do at Alyx, from who we see the same things, every playthrough.  If you think Zoey has no depth, look harder.</p>

<p>Hell no. Are you a damn moron??? Rochelle developed? YOU only know so much about Zoey because of her lines and the comics. Valve develops its story around Gordon Damn Freeman. You obviously didn’t understand Half-Life 1 or 2 at this point. It’s about Freeman, Barney, Kleiner for the most part, the three Stooges. G-Man is really what the series revolves around as well, and the combine. Mainly because they are tied to the semi-whole theme of the game, teleportation and physics. And a sub category of physics for Half-Life, is puzzles.</p>

<p>She had a really minor role but she really stood out in my book.  She’s in Route Kanal and tells Gordon to keep going and, “I’m gonna stay here in case any others come through. Gotta keep the railway alive.”</p>
<p>For a bit part, this woman, Mary, stands out in my mind, so I’m going to be different from the Alyxes, Chells, Rochelles and Zoes here and say Mary.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yeah, you know, you’re right.  As a matter of fact I think she says, “keep going FRIEND”.     <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
