    <title>i, too, am experiencing the issue where Black Mesa doesn&#39;t launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-too-am-experiencing-the-issue-where-black-mesa-doesnt-launch/15284</link>
    <description>This issue has existed ever since I bought and installed the retail version of Black Mesa.
It&#39;ll say &quot;preparing to launch&quot;, Black Mesa will show &quot;Running&quot; for a few seconds and my Steam icon&#39;s border will turn green, and bms.exe will appear in task manager for a few moments, but then it just quietly exits and my icon turns blue again.

There&#39;s no dump in Steam\dumps\, but here&#39;s what shows up in Event Viewer when I try to run the game:
Faulting application name: bms.exe, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x59833c8f
Faulting module name: vstdlib.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x59833c5a
Exception code: 0xc0000005
Fault offset: 0x00004a1e
Faulting process id: 0x3bd0
Faulting application start time: 0x01d34066a1c35b07
Faulting application path: F:\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bms.exe
Faulting module path: F:\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bin\vstdlib.dll
Report Id: bb4fb75b-8d68-49b5-a95a-653ef8f79c3b
Faulting package full name:
Faulting package-relative application ID:

i&#39;m running:
Windows 10 Home (x64) v1703 build 15063.608
12GB RAM
AMD Radeon RX 580 (Software Version: 17.1.1; Software Edition: Crimson ReLive)
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690K CPU @ 3.50GHz
Gigabyte H97-HD3 motherboard

I&#39;ve tried:
- Verifying the game cache (comes up clean)
- Uninstalling and re-instaling the game (twice, iirc)
- Re-installing / repairing DirectX9, VC++ 2010 and VC++ 2013 (both the x86 and x64 versions in order where possible)
- Installing Visual C++ 2017
- Disabling the Steam Overlay in-game (back on now), &quot;Use Desktop Theatre while SteamVR is active&quot;, Steam Cloud synchronization (back on now)
- Switching to each available public beta program (now back on the original)
- Running the .exe directly, and in compatibility modes for win8 and win7, enabling &quot;override high dpi scaling behavior&quot;, &quot;disable fullscreen optimizations&quot; and as admin, and also trying to run it through Steam running in admin mode
- Expanding the file permissions for bms.exe
- Closing Steam, removing the appmanifest file along with all the workshop-related files associated with BMS&#39;s appid (though I&#39;ve never downloaded any workshop content for BMS), then restarting Steam and having it re-discover the existing files
- Running the game off my E:\ drive rather than my main Steam directory on my F:\ drive
- Setting launch options -windowed -noborder
- Setting launch option -condebug
- Setting launch option -autoconfig
- Making absolutely sure I don&#39;t still have the sourcemod version installed somewhere
- Removing vstdlib.dll; replacing it with a renamed vstdlib_s.dll, replacing it with the vstdlib.dll found in HL2&#39;s directory, then eventually putting the original back
- Disabling the WattMan profile automatically generated by my AMD Radeon software
- Restarting the computer (also several times, between steps and also this is the most recent thing I&#39;ve done)

I miss being able to play this game</description>

            <p>Try removing Steam, restart your computer and then reinstall Steam.<br>
The dll giving the error is a Steam dll and I’m believing that reinstalling Steam  may solve your issue</p>

<p>Was about to suggest it too, but whilst you’re at it then might as well update the BIOS. At least that’s one driver that won’t go away with a format.</p>

            <p>When I see a list like yours where you’re doing random renaming of components and swapping parts in and out with another game I can only think one thing.<br>
And that one thing is FUBAR.</p>
<p>Format your computer and reinstall. That will fix it.</p>
