    <title>BRUTAL performance issues [no fixes seem to work...]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/brutal-performance-issues-no-fixes-seem-to-work/10114</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried everything in the sticky, I&#39;ve tried enabling multicore in the autoexec.cfg, allocating more memory to the game, etc. - nothing seems to help.

When playing everything on low at 640x480, there will be times when I&#39;m running 350fps, but in the same room, will experience a drop to as low as 7.
On high at 720p, I usually maintain 60fps, but, again, VERY often have extreme framerate drops.

Running an Intel i5 3450, 8gb DDR3 ram, integrated graphics - which I don&#39;t think should be an issue, as it works great for just about everything else.

Any ideas?</description>

            <p>Integrated Intel GMA HD is your problem here. TF2 and LoL are specially optimized to be as low demanding on GPU as possible so more players would be able to play these games. You should really try something like HL2:EP2 or Portal 2 to check if your GPU is a bottleneck (which I bet it is). Also, keep in mind that BMS isn’t as perfectly optimized as are full-blown commercial games from Valve or GearBox. It’s a “at free time”-developed mod after all.</p>

<p>Integrated graphics is almost certainly your issue.  How does HL2:Ep2 run?  Because Black Mesa is built on the same engine, but is much more taxing on your system.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t have HL2:E2 but if it helps at all, I can run TF2 maxed out at 60+ FPS, League of Legends maxed out at 60fps, Fallout 3 maxed at 60fps, etc</p>
