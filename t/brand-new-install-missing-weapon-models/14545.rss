    <description>Just bought this game on Steam last week.  Went to play it today and after I picked up the crowbar I noticed there was no model for it.  I went ahead and played up until the scientist opened the door were the weapons are at and all of those do not show up as well.  How do I fix this?</description>

            <p>Since I had already done 1 through 3 I tried 4.  That fixed it!  Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>Here are the steps I would take to troubleshoot your problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. Both Windows 8 and 10 have a hybrid hibernation file that will corrupt over time and the only way to clear it is by restarting. Shutting down the pc and turning it back on does not clear it.</li>
<li>A lot of mods are broken with the latest update. Properly unsubscribe, uninstall and remove any mods you have installed.</li>
<li>Verify your Game Cache. here is a link explaining how.<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335</a>
</li>
<li>A saved game could be corrupt. Go to New Game and restart an unlocked chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of problems are fixed by step 4, but steps 1-3 are good maintenance.</p>
<p>Please reply with your fix and if you have any other questions. Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Use the “Verify integrity of game cache” function steam offers to redownload any corrupt or missing files. I installed it today and it works for me so there is probably something wrong with the download.<br>
You can verify the game cache by right clicking on the game in your steam library, then click on “properties”, switch to the “local files” tab, “Verify integrity of game cache…”</p>
