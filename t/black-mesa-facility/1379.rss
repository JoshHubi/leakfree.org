    <description>With the release of HL Decay PC i have since grabbed all the overviews for the levels, but am still having some difficulty putting them all together so this overview is not the final version im afraid but its getting pretty close  :smiley:

            <p>I’m almost certain fair few people will complain about some maps overlapping.</p>
<p>I for one wouldn’t.</p>

<p>We’ve got better things to do than rearrange the entire game to make sure it doesn’t overlap.</p>

            <p>well the levels from residue processing onwards are organized thanks to the level setups from later games, that how i was able to get everything lined up like it should be. Was thinking of using autocad to work out a 3d representation of the entire facility, which is why i recorded the vertical heights of each map when i was making this overview.<br>
What ive heard from the BMS guys is that theyre trying to organize the levels in such a way that makes more sense with possibly no overlaps, so one can only hope</p>

            <p>Someone should do this in 3D… totally possible in Hammer but also completely confusing because I can only presume there will be areas that are in exactly the same space.</p>
<p>I wonder what <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa’s rendition of Black Mesa</span> will look like in full overview. :fffuuu:</p>

<p>well hardly see how the many overlaps are really my fault, personally i find it kind of funny, i mean how did you expect to make so many left turns and not end up where you started. Overview overlap is just one of the funny quirks of level design.<br>
And as for the overlaps its not really a big deal with the exception of the surface levels in which case yeah, they do overlap a lot and its pretty bad. Ironically you cover more ground in the opening train ride (in the sense of net distance) than you do in the rest of the game (probably because of all those left turns)<br>
But without adding in the gearbox overviews itd be impossible to tie the whole thing together, need i remind you, you are knocked unconcious at one point…</p>

            <p>There’s an overlap in HL alone. Level overview doesn’t exactly show you any depth. If I remember correctly someone said a good portion of a level would be floating in the air above the dam.</p>

            <p>If you do do all the gearbox expansions, I bet there will be an overlap, or at least a room that turns out to be invisible from the outside and floating in the sky.</p>

            <p>Hint: Half-Life is the only one that really counts as far as laying out a map goes. Because apparently, none of gearbox’s games actually happened.</p>
