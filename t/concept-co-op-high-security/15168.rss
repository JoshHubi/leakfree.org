    <title>[concept] co-op: high security</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/concept-co-op-high-security/15168</link>
    <description>yeah this is unlikely to happen but after reading the F.A.Q on steam and seeing the co-op part I got an idea for it.


[b]HIGH SECURITY[/b]
info: 4 player co-op game mode where the players play as a team of security guards working black mesa before, during, and after the cascade.
game structure: similar to l4d in set up, with players fighting to get from one &quot;safe&quot; zone to another in segments each segment will contain a few maps and events.
play stile: similar to SVEN co-op with an added twist of a weapon limit (so team play is incuraged)

player stats
HP: 50 max
ARMOR: based on vest, standard 25 (similar to blue shift you use vests and helmets to bring up armor. max is 25)
WEAPONS SYSTEM: primary, secondary, melee, power, grenade. these are the 4 slots the palyer will have each only allowing one weapon.
slots
MELEE: baton(crowbar reskin), crowbar, combat knife(faster speed lower damage), medkit (you can pick them up or use them.)
SECONDARY: glock, revolver, deagle (reference to OP:force, has a 9 round mag, and deals same damage as a revolver).
PRIMARY: shotgun, SMG, crossbow.
POWER: RPG, LMG(150 rounds can hold 150 spare has its own ammo but rare),
GRENADE: frag, satchel charge, trip mine.

SEGMENT ONE: just another shift.
Story start: the game starts with all 4 players on a tram, equipped with a full vest, pistol with 3 spare mags worth of ammo, and a baton. the tram announcement states the following.

Welcome to the black mesa tram line. currently inbound to sector G high security labs, from sector A main depot.


*the players see that they are leaving from a security check point which has HECU grunts and gaurds talking., shortly after the last line is stated the tram his an elevator and starts moving down. as it does so a voice comes over the intercom similar to that of a scientist.



Ah, hello. is this thing on. Oh it is, uh Anyway. Hello and welcome to sector G security detail. I know you all are use to the cushy jobs above ground but I can promise you that working in our division will give you more then ample experience with your fellow security and science team personnel, like *bzt*


* at this point the power flashes the tram is still on the elevator and has passed two other floors. while going down.


Blast, sorry about that, sector C just started their experiment for the day damn mas spectrometer drains the power like mad with hope it will be be over soon. well guess there goes the speech the next floor will be your stop. 



*the tram stops decending and moves to a platform just as it gets there the power flashes again. players are free to leave the tram at this point.


As soon as the door ahead of the players opens the game truly starts. the residence cascade begins and head crabs start teleporting in around the players and the security door.


MAIN set up: after the intro (only level with one) the players will be tasked with fighting their way to a security station. the path to it goes through several labs and crosses the tram line once.

major events during SEGMENT ONE:

1. tram derail blocking path requiring players to work out a puzzle to get around it.
2. several scientists are found through out the level, getting them to safety (security checkpoints) gives access to better weapons and fresh armor.
3. large fire fight between the gaurds and waves of hound eyes and bull squids.

ENDING EVENT: this segment ends with the players making it to a main security hub, where several guards are attempting to hold off a large number of houndeyes. the players are tasked with staying alive while a scientist tries to blow a section of the tunnel blocking off where the creatures are comming from. though after 5 minutes another guard comes in and blows it with a freaking RPG. from this point players simply enter the security hub and the segment ends.



SEGMENT TWO
start: like all segments after this segment two starts from a security hub, in this case the sector G security hub one of hte lowest down hubs. at this point the players are told by another gaurd (one in some heavy looking armor think full swat, this is the one that fired the RPG) to make their way to sector E and try to get contact with the surface, their are about 3 other guards one is injured and the other two state they have to stay behind to keep the scientists safe. (aka the players are the short straw drawers).


segment type: weapons testing and offices, the players can actually get some power weapons early on in this segment. this segment has headcrab zombies as the main enemy with vorts and hound eyes appearing from time to time. near the end you hear the announcement system state it is under military control.

EVENTS
1. having to cross a large cafeteria  over run with headcrab zombies
2. a scientist and guard that can be escorted to a security check point. like all similar events is optional but gives rewards in this case SMG&#39;s with grenades and fresh vests.
3. near the end a group of soldiers arrive via a lift, blowing it behind them. players see from distance with the soldiers shooting zombies first. when get closer they are hostile.

ENDING EVENT: players make their way to sector E&#39;s security hub only to find it burned out by some sort of explosion a scientist tells you the military came through and killed everyone. just as the scientist opens the door they are shot in the back by a hecu grunt, from this point the players have to clear out several grunts before entering the hub and moving on.




I have ideas beyond this point, but the overall idea is to have 6 sections each the length of a level set. the idea to play this group as they move from the lowest part of the facility to the surface and escape via a car or small aircraft, all along helping the science team and each other.

the game play would be slightly slower then your standard fast paced play do to the players having a lower health pool and armor. as well as the limited slots requiring players to think about what their allies have and if they really need to have 4 players armed with SMG&#39;s for a tight area that might have a lot of headcrab zombies and bullsquids.




SPECIAL IDEAS FOR THIS.



BMRF: SWAT
info: ex military trained guards, generally armed with shotguns. these guys have full swat gear and a higher health pool then the players, for the most part they are just another gun but in some cases they use power weapons.

HECU HEAVY
info: a hecu grunt with either an RPG or LMG a big threat to the players, the only real way to tell by looking is by the fact they are holding the weapon.


LMG
info: a m249 saw, used by the hecu for fire support and area suppression. loaded with 5.56 ammo it is the rarest automatic weapon in the co-op missions but also the most powerful.


A-grunt tank
info: great this one has smart armor placement, by that I mean it is completely armored immune to anything not shots from the revolver/deagle, and explosives. almost as big of a threat as a garg.  (seen only in later levels which are to take place after freeman enters xen)


HECU Survivors
info: late game like last 2 segments players will run into hecu grunts who are not hostile, are bloody, and in many cases only have a pistol if armed at all.


BLACK OPS
info: seen only in the last segment which would be called &quot;nuclear run&quot; where the players are trying to escape before the black ops goons set off a nuke. these guys are more or less hecu grunts with a different skin and better aim.

            <p>In my opinion coop is the most fun with only 2 players and no respawning but the ability to revive your teammate. In resident evil 5 I liked coop a lot because you had no army of respawning players and you had to manage your resources carefully. You had a limited inventory and you was able to fail your mission by dying both or letting enemies kill your VIP (when there was some unarmed important  ally you had to guard). Sometimes you had to go seperate ways just to find a way to open up some new way and to find together again. What I generally not like is when enemies become bulletsponge and can tank unreasonable amounts of damage. It’s not fun and not rewarding either… And ideally I’d like to play it with original Half-Life 1 weapons and not too many extra stuff. Maybe with low amounts of ammo or limited inventory.</p>

            <p>I think you need 1 security guard ,1 inbound worker,1 scientist and 1 office worker or hev suit scientist for more intresting gameplay.Also need a cool boss fight at the end of the campany ( Sorry for bad english)</p>
