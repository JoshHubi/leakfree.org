    <description>Hai guise haven&#39;t been on here in aaaages due to certain events happening etc etc but I thought i&#39;d return with this.
I brought Need For Speed Undercover recently and was fairly disappointed with it due to 1. It&#39;s far too easy 2. it&#39;s shorter than portal 3. It&#39;s the exact same map as most wanted just it&#39;s been re modelled. The story line doesn&#39;t make that much sense either. One minute people hate you the next they&#39;re your friends etc etc. So yeah anyone else had any games they were disappointed with?</description>

            <p>Shadow of Chernobyl. Not the game itself, I loved it, but the ending completely threw you into the frying pan. First you have to fight through a floor of about sixty Monolith and whatever health kits you bought or found (Barkeep, Sakharov and Sid only sell about a combined total of nine at a time, so good luck.) Also high radiation is about as deadly as the bullets themselves. Finally if you decide to get the canon ending you have to go do the same thing twice. The teleport thing was kind of cool at the end and the cutscene was too, but it wasn’t worth two hours of my life getting that.</p>

            <p>I seriously thought Darkest of Days would be awesome when I first heard of it. I mean, come on. You’re a time-travelling fixer-upper that gets to kill confederate soldiers with modern assault rifles.</p>
<p>Once I played it, however, I wanted to punch the developer in the face. When you have an FPS that manages to be <span class="bbcode-i">incredibly boring,</span> then you screwed up in more ways than I can imagine.</p>

            <p>Ratchet Deadlocked. I remember I was excited for the release, and got it the day it came out. I beat it in a few days, and was pretty underwhelmed. I traded it in maybe a week or two later.<br>
I’ve always been a big ratchet and clank fan, and that game was really the only misstep in the series. It tried WAY too hard to change the formula and ended up being a lackluster game.<br>
I couldn’t tell you how glad I was when Tools of Destruction returned to the original style.</p>
