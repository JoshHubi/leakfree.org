<p>well…I’m sure you’re right. But one thing I can’t understand is : why the fuck am I still posting here? it would be obvious to any sane person that I should just get the fuck out of here. Maybe I like drama? Maybe I like fucking with ppl? Or…the best one: Everyone that gets ticked off by my posts, just are somekind of lonely and sad people. So this said, I don’t get kicks out of the drama here any more.

<p>I’m not even gonna bother reading your posts, I’m sure you have written some shit but I am not interested in 'em. In fact I don’t care about anything that’s related to you.</p>
<p>So Bitch, please take your idiocy elsewhere and get back on the topic of Bitches.</p>
<p>Also if you are gonna be a racist, speak English please, so that I can understand you and not give a fuck.[/SIZE]</p>

<p>FUCK YOU. How’s that for english? Yeah me being a racist…sure, cocksuckers like you make me one. Congrats. Now, go and kill some more Armenians…or kurds…asshole.</p>
<p>who the fuck even puts X infront and after his nick? fucking douchebag</p>
<p>14 posts and I have made a lot of enemies…so I think it’s time to put an end to this.</p>
