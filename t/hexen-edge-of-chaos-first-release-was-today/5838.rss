    <title>Hexen: Edge of Chaos first release was today</title>

Doom 3 powered Hexen sequel, so you&#39;ll need a fully patched copy of Doom 3 (which is worth the ridiculous $20 price for the Dark Mod alone, btw).

Anyone played it yet? I&#39;ve been following this mod since it was announced, so I&#39;m obviously excited, but my internet connection is just a tethered phone right now so the download is extremely slow.</description>

            <p>Holy Moses. I LOVE Hexen. I can’t wait for this to finish downloading. Thanks for sharing this gibbelin. Good eye.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, this is so cool. I can’t tell if I love it or not, but it sure does bring back some good memories. They’re doing a pretty damn good job too.</p>
