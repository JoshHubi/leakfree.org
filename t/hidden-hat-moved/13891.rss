    <description>Hidden hat is not in the container during second Black Ops encounter in the Steam version. Can someone tell me where it was moved? (Yeah, I&#39;m lazy, don&#39;t judge me)</description>

            <p>The most difficult part was the cliffside, u cannot run with the hat in your hand and the hat kept falling down when thrown, so thanks to the deves letting us save the game!</p>

<p>I’m glad someone else feels  this way, as well.  Whenever I mentioned it, I was basically told I was crazy.<br>
As for the Gargantua, you <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> just throw the hat forward, sprint, pick it up, and repeat the process.</p>

            <p>I just got this achievement.  I’m not even sure why, but there it is.  A few general thoughts…</p>
<p>As people noted, there were a few levels where you can leave the hat in one place early in the level and pick it up at the end of the level…these would be We’ve Got Hostiles, Blast Pit, Power Up, and Questionable Ethics.</p>
<p>On a Rail sucked…really annoying.  And the hard part wasn’t even keeping the hat in the tram, although that wasn’t necessarily easy.  It was getting up the ladders of the rocket during the part where you climb up 3 tiers and then close the doors and raise the rocket.  Maybe I was doing something wrong, but the bottom of the floor I was climbing up a ladder to kept knocking the hat out of my hands.  I ended up needing to throw the hat to the next tier and then retrieving it each time.</p>
<p>Another thing that really sucked was the part where the gargantua chases you in Surface Tension.  If you’re holding the hat you can’t outrun him, so you keep taking damage (maybe you can put the hat down and go back?  I didn’t think so but maybe I should try)</p>
<p>By contrast, I didn’t find the teleporters that hard…it was a pain to have to teleport the hat first and then retrieve it, but it seemed like a manageable thing to do, rather than the others, which felt poorly thought out.</p>
<p>Anyhow, fun achievement overall.  I don’t know if it’s easier or harder than the gnome achievment, but it certainly takes longer.  I’d advise everyone trying to play on easy, unless you really want a struggle.</p>

            <p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hMWazED.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Got the achievement yesterday.</a> If I never see another purple hat again in my life, it will be too soon.</p>
<p>A tip for anyone else attempting it, you CAN leave the hat in places you loop back around to. It will stick around and then you save yourself some carrying. Also, make sure it won’t roll away… the damn thing loves to roll. You can also set your difficulty to Easy if you want to rush through things. My dumb ass didn’t think to do that until I was already 2/3 of the way through the game, lol. And yes, getting it through the teleporters was just as brutal as the previous release.</p>

            <p>Well, mystery solved. When you hold the hat while getting knocked out, it will spawn right there:<br>

<p>Yeah, that was actually also <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/14745-Disappointed-with-hidden-hat-achievement/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">my thread</a>, that’s why I asked, and I see they really made it like the Gnome achievement… but what happens at Apprehension? Will it spawn in crusher room if you throw it to the room where HECUs knock you out?</p>

<p>Only hats 1 and 3 existed in 2012 release AFAIK but only the 3rd one could trigger the achievement. On Steam, hat 3 is absent (I don’t know about the other 2).</p>
