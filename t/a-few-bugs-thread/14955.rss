    <title>A Few Bugs thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-few-bugs-thread/14955</link>
    <description>This bug appeared after the update:
1) Stuttering while walking on displacements (plain brushes are fine). Happened to me on these servers (a few other players confirmed the same issue):

[code]95.85.8.100:27016
31.186.250.33:27015
31.186.250.106:27070
46.101.59.153:27015[/code]I only checked these, but for example LAN server I created by myself and a couple of other servers are totally fine. Could be a server issue? But it was never there before the update, so I don&#39;t know really.

And these bugs seem to be there forever and yet not fixed.
2) g-man doesn&#39;t seem to have a swimming animation (one screenshot attached)
3) g-man&#39;s legs start to walk really fast (like some insect) for really no reason. It was fine, but he spawned some other time and his legs were &quot;walking&quot; on like x4 speed (player&#39;s speed remained the same ofc).
4) gauss laser issue. Seems to be there forever. Didn&#39;t anyone really complained about it? (two screenshots attached).

Hoping to see the fix!  :slight_smile:  
(P.S. I own the game on Steam)

            <p>Please fix those invisible player issues at least…here I am just played it again, one of the players became invisible - other players confirmed that they SEE him fine (so it’s a client issue?). Aaaaand when he died, my game crashed right in that very moment.<br>
This is really annoying and a major bug which makes the game literally unplayable!</p>

            <p>Another very small non-gameplay issue I discovered today. On dm_gasworks, the stars in the sky stop flickering approximately 1-2 minutes from loading the map. Their animation just stop and they becoming a static dots.<br>
I also checked the skybox to look at this closely.</p>
<p>Also, nice idea to set them up in skybox’s sphere, I thought they were drawn  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Okay, so these are totally not fixed yet. And it’s been more than a whole year. Yes, I know you guys are busy with Xen, but I hope you will fix these someday. You might ask “why do you even care about these little things” - cause I want the game to be perfect. Especially because the game has huge attention to detail everywhere and these little things just seem really off! I mean, how can you spent so much time over-detailing the game everywhere but live in peace with these hilarious bugs?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>More bugs for you today (I just played the game few minutes ago):</p>
<ol>
<li>fps drops to 40 on dm_apache while anyone shooting the stationary weapon;</li>
<li>disappearing weapons on United Gamers server on spawn. What I also noticed that the respawn time there is very short, could it be something to do with this?</li>
</ol>
<p>And just to sum up all bugs:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>g-man’s legs start to walk really fast (like some insect) for really no reason. It was fine, but he spawned some other time and his legs were “walking” on like x4 speed (player’s speed remained the same ofc).</li>
<li>gauss laser issue. Seems to be there forever. Didn’t anyone really complained about it? (two screenshots attached in the first post).</li>

            <p>Began to play multiplayer again and my game keeps crashing to desktop on various servers! Also sometimes some player models just becoming invisible, I thought the guy was cheating for sure. Like, there’s no model at all, just shooting from the air  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I also noticed that “laser shooting from the head issue” is still not fixed, as well as the laser beam being extremely T H I C C. Didn’t check the swimming animations because I just didn’t happen to see them.</p>
<p>So, about those crashing to desktop, I’d wish to send dump files or anything, but I couldn’t find them anywhere… That’s really annoying and I’m pretty sure that wasn’t happening before.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing I just came across - crossbow reloading time! It’s the same when I reload it with some arrows left and when empty, yet the animations are totally different. Reloading the empty one should take more time.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Dmx6</span>, everything seems fine on other maps, it’s just this particular place. Also I noticed the same lags in the room with water (still subtransit). I have Windows 7.</p>

            <p>And here’s another bug. Map - subtransit.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">ATTENTION! </span>For those who want to confirm the bug, please download the attached zip and try out this BSP file (put it in maps directory and run through console “map lightbug”).</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">The ZIP archive only contains BSP and VMF file of my “small research”.</span></p>
<p>Now, onto the thing. You can see the spot in the screenshot. When you shoot there with a glock or mp5, the game begins to stutter so bad. You can shoot by yourself or another guy can shoot too - the game stutters. Another guy who shot me there with his mp5, confirmed the same issue. I was really curious and did my research - what could be the cause of this. I copied this part of subtransit into new VMF and cleaned the room until I got rid of the bug. The thing is, and you see the second screenshot, even in this empty room with plain walls game still stutters when I shoot with mp5. The bug was gone when I replaced all textures to a grey dev texture. I don’t really know the exact solution, but I hope this info was helpful for devs.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Another multiplayer bug I discovered recenlty. Seen on Undertow but I think it’s pretty much everywhere where’s water. So, when some player gets out from the water using ladder, his animation stays the same (swimming). So he’s just, like, flying above ground until someone shoot him dead. Looks like a ghost or something. I think animation should change from swimming to default one on ladder contact.</p>

            <p>This bug appeared after the update:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stuttering while walking on displacements (plain brushes are fine). Happened to me on these servers (a few other players confirmed the same issue):</li>
</ol>
<p><code>95.85.8.100:27016
31.186.250.33:27015
31.186.250.106:27070
46.101.59.153:27015</code>I only checked these, but for example LAN server I created by myself and a couple of other servers are totally fine. Could be a server issue? But it was never there before the update, so I don’t know really.</p>
<p>And these bugs seem to be there forever and yet not fixed.<br>
2) g-man doesn’t seem to have a swimming animation (one screenshot attached)<br>
3) g-man’s legs start to walk really fast (like some insect) for really no reason. It was fine, but he spawned some other time and his legs were “walking” on like x4 speed (player’s speed remained the same ofc).<br>
4) gauss laser issue. Seems to be there forever. Didn’t anyone really complained about it? (two screenshots attached).</p>
<p>Hoping to see the fix!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
(P.S. I own the game on Steam)</p>
