    <title>Can I Load The BM SoundTrack In HL:S ? If Yes, Then How ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/can-i-load-the-bm-soundtrack-in-hl-s-if-yes-then-how/13521</link>
    <description>Hey Guys , i figured i would replace the HL SoundTrack from HL Source with the one from BM (probably because i&#39;m one of those few people who thinks that the BM tracks Blow the HL tracks out of the water), problem is, as you know, the BM tracks play in different locations then the HL tracks, so i have 2 questions:

1.) can someone help / tell me witch track should have what file name (so that the locations would match) in the form of:
Half-Life01.mp3 -&gt; we&#39;ve got hostiles (and so on) ?

2.) is it possible to use a few scripts (or something like that) to get tracks like &quot;on a rail 2&quot; &amp; &quot;questionable ethics 1&quot; to play at the right locations ? and if yes, how would i do that with all the In-Game BM tracks ? (only the ones used in BM , not including those 4 or 5 unused tracks) ?

Thanks  :smiley:</description>

<p>In order to get them to play in the same places, you’d have to decompile the maps, open them in Hammer, fix the decompilation-induced errors (to ensure the maps actually work when you’re done (also not a guarantee)), then edit the maps manually to cue the tracks to play where you need/want them. It’d be a lot of effort, esp. if you don’t have any level design experience.</p>

<p>ah, i knew it ! the map tells them where they should play (i figured there might be an easier way. but i guess not) and i don’t even know where to start, i have no idea how to edit maps, and getting into it just for this… well, hell no, thanks for the tip though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  (i started playing BM again so this isn’t really a thing anymore, but whatever, hm… who knew i had to overclock my gpu to get black mesa to run at, like, 60 fps and above <em>For the most part</em>, sometimes it goes back to the 30s, ultra intense stuff like all the clouds and stuff at the start of unforeseen consequences go at 20 fps or so, not a huge deal, as this kind of lag only seams to happen when i’m exploring the levels and stuff, so far the only time when i had to go on low settings to make it playable was that part in we’ve got hostiles where there’s a helicopter who tries to air strike you, and, marines everywhere… other then that it’s working great so far… hm, it’s funny because BM is CPU intensive, yet a GPU overclock kinda helped, even though it wasn’t using much of it in the first place, i would try overclocking my cpu as well, but this is a laptop, on top of that, i have no way to do it through the BIOS and it feels way more dangerous then a GPU overclock, i guess i could do it through software, but i might have to look for a guide and stuff, i’m kind of, up in the air when it comes to it…</p>

<p>Although HL:S may also be in the Half-Life 2 folder now that I think about it. So if it’s not the above, look for an audio folder in ./Common/hl2/hl :s  or something like that.</p>

<p>yeah, it’s in …\steam\steamapps\common\half-life 2\hl1\sound\music (at least in my version)…</p>
<p>Thanks, though my other question would be how i would be able to get music tracks like “On A Rail 2” and “Questionable ethics 1” to play at the same locations at witch they would play in BM ?</p>
<p>oh btw, anyone who knows me from my previous posts, well, let’s just say i’m playing on the same hardware, though this time i overclocked my gpu and tweaked the BM advanced video settings to balance both performance and graphics, it looks damn good, and i get about 70 fps most of the time (i’m in blast pit, holy shit this mod rocks in so many levels)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  and i’ve installed a bunch of mods / skins and stuff and it still works great…</p>
