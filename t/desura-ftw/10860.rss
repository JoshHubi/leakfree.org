    <description>After trying to download all those other links which didnt work I tried the Desura link again and it finally worked. I didnt have to attach any files or anything and it was really easy. Im so happy right now and if your one of those people who had a hard time downloading this like me then try Desura because it should work. I thought I would just let everyone know. Now if you dont mind Im gonna go enjoy my Black Mesa Source so Peace out.  :slight_smile:</description>
