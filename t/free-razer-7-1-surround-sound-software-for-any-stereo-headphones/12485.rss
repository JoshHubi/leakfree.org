    <title>FREE Razer 7.1 Surround Sound Software For ANY Stereo Headphones</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/free-razer-7-1-surround-sound-software-for-any-stereo-headphones/12485</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s something that some of you may be interested in taking advantage of, while it&#39;s still available for free. It allows [b][i][u]ANY[/u][/i][/b] pair of stereo headphones to simulate 7.1 surround sound. After the end of the year, it will cost US$19.99. In order to obtain this software, registration on the Razer website is required. Try out the online demo to get an idea of what it can do. By the way, once installed, there is the option to use it in offline mode. However, by doing so, you won&#39;t be automatically alerted that an updated version is available.

I&#39;m using this and quite like the &quot;surround&quot; effect that it provides. There are a number of options available to tweak it to your liking. BMS sounds better than ever. Also, don&#39;t worry that come the new year you won&#39;t be able to continue using it without paying US$19.99. Provided you use the software at least once during this free offer period, it&#39;ll continue to remain free to you, even after the new year. Here&#39;s a link to Razer&#39;s FAQ page, should you have any concerns or questions. [url=&#39;https://www.razersupport.com/software/surround/&#39;]https://www.razersupport.com/software/surround/[/url]

Finally (whew), here&#39;s a link to a video comparing the Razer 7.1 Surround to Creative&#39;s CMSS-3D Surround, that&#39;s provided with their higher-end standalone soundcards. [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdT9XVZlEGk&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdT9XVZlEGk[/url]. If you don&#39;t own a Creative soundcard with CMSS-3D, or even if you do, you may want to take advantage of this Razer Surround software. You might prefer it over Creative&#39;s CMSS-3D, like the maker of the video.  

And for those of you wondering, no, I don&#39;t have any affiliation with Razer Inc. (although I should get some sort of commission for doing this).


There, my good deed for the day is done.


PS. I&#39;m not responsible if your computer goes boom, as a result of using this software. Mine didn&#39;t.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I haven’t experienced these issues and the surround sound effect is definitely noticeable and far superior to the 2D sound I had before.</p>

            <p>I got this a while ago, it’s not really worth the setup. IMO the effect is only apparent when you’re setting it up, after that it just sounds like standard headphones but half of the sounds are muffled. Not to mention how it occasionally breaks/isn’t detected by the audio of a program or game.</p>

            <p>Just a friendly reminder that this software is free only until the end of this month, after which you have to pay for it. Time is running out, so if you’re interested in getting this, act now.</p>
