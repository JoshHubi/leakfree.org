    <description>any good stories about some of your launches?
i have two at the moment.
the first is when it shot me so far, i hit one of the buildings in the iddle island (forgot what it&#39;s called XD)
the second one is when it shot me about a km out in the ocean. had to load last save :[
that exploit is something i hope rockstar never fixes. and i don&#39;t think they wan&#39;t to either</description>

<p>^this.</p>
<p>I was on once, doing a stoppie, I wasn’t going all that fast really (since too fast and you fall off), anyway, Since your balancing on the front wheel, it’s not the easiest thing to steer, and I ended up hitting the back of a car at around 20Km/h, which isn’t that fast.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was launch about 40m in the air, over a highway I flew about 100m through the air before face-planting a Petrol Station sign at the near highest point, you know those RON ones, I hit the logo dead center was insta-killed, then fell to the ground head first again and left the most awesome blood splatter.</p>

<p>I fell off a building once and almost hit someone, just hit the back of their foot as they were running. I died, naturally, but this guy is going to have a hell of a foot surgery.</p>
<p>I like to think how I’d ruin people’s days in GTA, like I steal a car and plough into the back of a nice car, and I think “Man, I fucked over that guy, he can take my license plate, but then he’s just screwing over the guy who got his car stolen”</p>
<p>Best is flying out from behind a breakable fence and knocking over a hotdog salesman. Just thinking "man, I just ruined your business, plus now you’re going to be in the hospital.</p>

            <p>The worst is when you’re standing right on the edge of a roof, and you know if you turn, one foot will go off and you’ll fall, but you can’t just stand there forever.<br>
<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji only-emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>There is one mission where you have to stand on a roof, and get a guy to come to his window with a sniper rifle, so I figured, if I drop a grenade down onto the street, that’d bring him to his window, so I pull out the grenade, accidentally drop it at my feet. I try to run away, but end up leaping over the edge just as the grenade goes off. The blast sends me flying into the wall of the apartment where the guy lives and I fall to the ground and die. I never saw if he came to his window.</p>
<p>Second time around I just shot his TV.</p>

            <p>any good stories about some of your launches?<br>
i have two at the moment.<br>
the first is when it shot me so far, i hit one of the buildings in the iddle island (forgot what it’s called XD)<br>
the second one is when it shot me about a km out in the ocean. had to load last save :[<br>
that exploit is something i hope rockstar never fixes. and i don’t think they wan’t to either</p>
