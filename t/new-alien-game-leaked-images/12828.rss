Looking closely at the reflection on the face shield of the helmet reveals the image of a xenomorph.

The article by Kotaku states that &quot;Amanda Ripley mostly faces off against clones, soldiers and a single alien&quot;... a single alien???... where&#39;s the fun in that? Alien: Colonial Marines was blasted for its lack of confrontations with aliens, amongst other numerous issues.</description>

            <p>I’d love a game like that regardless of the branding. In fact, I think it if was set in the Alien universe it might be weaker than if it was its own thing.</p>

            <p>That would be interesting. I think it would also be interesting if the roles, strengths, weaknesses, personality, relationships, etc. were all randomly selected each game and had an impact on the game, so that you’d have to study the crew and learn about them to create situations where you can get them alone and hit em with your little mini-mouth. You’d also have to choose what order to eliminate them to affect how the game plays out later on. For instance, if you killed the person with the role of mechanic first, then the rest of the game, you could destroy systems and machinery and it wouldn’t get repaired, letting you turn off the lights or jam the airlocks, whereas if you kill a miner (I’m assuming you’d get maybe one or two kills in, depending on how you do them, before the crew catches on to what’s happening), the other miners stay out of the ship longer to finish their work, giving you less chances to kill them, but more time with less people in the ship. Or if you killed the person with the strong, leadership personality, then the rest of the crew would fall into disarray and might turn on each other, whereas if you kill a character that is well-liked by the crew, you might end up angering them instead of striking fear into them, making them harder to kill.</p>
<p>Man, I kinda want to play this game now.</p>

            <p>While we are wishing for things, I really want an Alien game, where you are the lone alien, and you have to kill as many of a ships crew before they escape or kill you. All development effort would go into making the crew AI as intelligent as possible and also thousands of lines of dialogue for a game that never, ever plays the same way twice.</p>

            <p>From what I’ve heard, it has a bit of a Riddick Vibe with an emphasis on melee combat and stealth. This could be awesome. If that’s the case, I think a marine/ merc might actually be scarier than a xeno,</p>

            <p>I’d love to see a horror game where the main enemy is the environment itself and there are next to no monsters to fight.</p>
<p>Would be nice if this game was set in a derelict spaceship slowly falling apart with just a couple of xenos stalking Amanda.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see fewer aliens but also none of that soldier shit either.   Some psychological tense horror akin to Alien and not Aliens.</p>

<p>Looking closely at the reflection on the face shield of the helmet reveals the image of a xenomorph.</p>
