            <p>Alternatively, you could use Link Shell Extension to create a symbolic link from wherever you installed the game to the steam folder.  I just did it and it worked perfectly.  No command lines to fiddle around with.</p>
<p><a href="https://lifehacker.com/5530931/link-shell-extension-creates-windows-symlinks-with-ease" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://lifehacker.com/5530931/link-shell-extension-creates-windows-symlinks-with-ease</a></p>
<p>Example:<br>
Game installed to D:\Games\BMS<br>
with LSE installed, right click on BMS folder and select Pick Link Source<br>
Navigate to and right click on steam\steamapps\sourcemods<br>
select Drop Link As-&gt;Junction<br>
BMS folder is now linked.</p>

            <p>Thanks.  That seems to have started the game (but then I got an error, which I’ll search for a fix in the forums).</p>

            <p>Muffin - if you insist on having BM installed on a different drive, then you can probably link the BMS folder into your sourcemods folder with a directory junction.  Open a Command Prompt (Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories, I think) and type:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mklink /J C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS I:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS</code></pre>
<p>You may need to right-click command prompt and select “run as administrator” in order to get this to work.  If it works, you should see a “BMS” folder show up in your sourcemods directory.  It’s not a copy, though; it’s more like a shortcut.  (I don’t use Windows command prompt very often, so I may have this command wrong.)  Then restart Steam and see if BMS shows up in your games list.  Steam is generally pretty happy with links.</p>
<p>EDIT: You might also need to escape spaces in the command, or put quotes around the directory names:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS" "I:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS"</code></pre>

            <p>Alas, I read original posts and was just confused.  I’ll try this, but question: is this syntax to run game from “Start -&gt; Run” box, or the target if I edit the properties of a shortcut icon?  This may be one source of my confusion.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I’m generally new to installing mods on Steam. How exactly do I get the game to launch? I extracted the files, installed the game and installed SDK Source 2007. I remember seeing somewhere on the Black Mesa group discussions page on Steam that I have to move the files to the sourcemods directory but the folder labelled BMS is already in the sourcemods folder. Could someone please help me out?</p>

            <p>Sadly, it has not done that for me. Could it be because I installed on not on the drive Steam is currently installed on? Is there any way to link to an .exe or add it to Steam?</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">HOW TO LAUNCH BLACK MESA INSTALLED IN OTHER FOLDER THEN STEAM:</span>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>Assume you have Steam installed in: <span class="bbcode-b">D:\Games\Steam</span><br>
Assume your Steam user name is: <span class="bbcode-b">Your_Steam_Username</span><br>
Assume you have game installed in: <span class="bbcode-b">D:\Games\Black Mesa</span></p>
<p>To lauch the game in command line you should type:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">“[COLOR=‘Yellow’]D:\Games\Steam\steamapps[COLOR=‘Cyan’]Your_Steam_Username\source sdk base 2007\hl2.exe” -game sourcetest -steam -game “[COLOR=‘Yellow’]D:\Games\Black Mesa”</span></p>
<p>If you are not familiar with command line you can create shortcut on desktop to <span class="bbcode-u">hl2.exe</span> by finding the file in your system (path can be different depends on when you got Steam installed) and then right click on it, chose sub-menu <span class="bbcode-u">Sent to</span> then chose <span class="bbcode-u">Desktop (create shortcut)</span>. After you done that, right click on newly created shortcut, chose <span class="bbcode-u">Properties</span> (properties windows will appear) and then change <span class="bbcode-u">Target</span> field with launch command from above.</p>
<p>Of course you have to change paths if you got them installed in other folders.</p>
