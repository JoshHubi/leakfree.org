            <p>well considering that Black Mesa achieved a lot more than some new games that come out today do… Kept my interest from start to finnish I’d say that if those figures are correct software companies should start firing</p>

            <p>No offense but this is a nonsense comparison.</p>
<p>And no discredit to BMS or Valve but when you think Valve built the engine from the ground up this thing you have posted ignores the obvious fact.</p>
<p>But still interesting I guess. And Valve took a long time between HL1 and HL2</p>
