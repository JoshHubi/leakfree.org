What are your peoples opinions eh? 


Honestly, im with this post ;

&quot;bollicks to them, i want to wake up on a Saturday morning to big greasy english breakfast with black pudding, bacon and sausage with the fat and grease still dripping off. I want my MacDonald&#39;s to make me feel like av put on a stone as soon i finish it and i want my kebabs to be greasy. Second hand smoke, alcohol and wars will kill us all anyway apparently so why not.&quot;

            <p>I work for some REALLY stupid people.<br>
About once a day someone will ask where the bathrooms are; for cryin’ out loud, there’s signs on BOTH of the doors.<br>
You know those grocery carts that have the stupid car-shaped plastic shells on them? Almost every time a customer comes up to the register with one of those pieces of shit, they want to switch carts!<br>
Don’t get me started on the stupidity regarding refrigerated products, if I received a check for the value of a diary/produce/frozen/deli item that was left on a shelf every time some redneck figures they don’t need it out of sight of a cooler, I’d be a bit richer.</p>

            <p>Let the fatties get fat, it’s not like poor people are disproportionately fat, get public healthcare, and then everyone else gets to pay for all the fucked up preventable diseases that being fat causes. Sounds like a good plan to me.</p>

            <p>If you go out and eat at McDonald’s every day and you have to buy two tickets just so you can fly on an airplane, you either ban fat in foods or give the fatasses a loaded gun with one round chambered to press against their temple.</p>
<p>If you can’t control yourself and stop yourself from bringing society to its knees with narcotics, tobacco, and now fatty foods, then you deserve to be treated like a toddler. Destroying yourself and crowding hospitals with your disease and forcing them to spend thousands of dollars to save your irresponsible ass is no worse than larceny or tax evasion.</p>

<p>^this</p>

            <p>I don’t even know where to begin with this. A fat ban would be ridiculous…</p>

<p>What are your peoples opinions eh?</p>
<p>Honestly, im with this post ;</p>
<p>“bollicks to them, i want to wake up on a Saturday morning to big greasy english breakfast with black pudding, bacon and sausage with the fat and grease still dripping off. I want my MacDonald’s to make me feel like av put on a stone as soon i finish it and i want my kebabs to be greasy. Second hand smoke, alcohol and wars will kill us all anyway apparently so why not.”</p>
