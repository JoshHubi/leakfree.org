            <p>The Crowbar Collective Discord server recently became a verified Discord partner server with a new vanity server invite URL: <a href="https://discord.gg/crowbarcollective" rel="nofollow noopener">https://discord.gg/crowbarcollective</a></p>
<p>There’s also Steam Discussions, which I guess is meant to be the replacement for this forum besides the Discord server. It now has a team of volunteer moderators and a few more subforums added to it.</p>

            <p>I formally joined the forums back in 2014 by registering an account but have been reading them for a fair bit longer. I’m sad to learn that they’ll will be taken down after all these years, and without being archived at that. It has been mostly downhill since the website redesign, but it’s still nice to come here occasionally and see what’s going on. Hopefully the developers will be able to release the 1.5 version of Black Mesa before that happens, even knowing they haven’t posted any updates here since late 2018 (they seemed to mostly move everything to Steam after that point).</p>

            <p>One Word<br>
<strong>VOTE</strong></p>
<p><em>or have more of the following</em><br>
The “billionaire” who hides his tax returns. The “genius” who hides his college grades. The “businessman” who bankrupted 3 casinos and lost over $1B in 10 years. The “playboy” who pays for sex. The “Christian” who doesn’t go to church. The “philanthropist” who defrauds charity. The “patriot” who dodged the draft. The “innocent man” who refuses to testify. The “president*” who takes no responsibility. The “tough, strong” man who wears make-up and hair spray. The 'deal maker" who has yet to close a deal.</p>
<p>Trump Talk Translated:</p>
<p>“Many People have told me” = Voices inside my head<br>
“A lot of people don’t know” = I just learned<br>
“Believe me” = I just lied<br>
“In Fact” = I’m about to lie<br>
“He’s a great guy” = I will deny ever knowing this person after they begin to tell the truth about me<br>
“MAGA” = Making my pockets fatter off the American tax payers<br>
“Nobody knew” = Everyone knew except me<br>
“Huge” = moderate to below average in size<br>
“Loser” = someone who makes me feel inferior due to their talent or accomplishments<br>
“Policy Briefing” = Watching Fox News<br>
“Liar” = Someone who tells the truth about me<br>
“Fake News” = Real news</p>

            <p>The world is absolutely a bummer right now.</p>

<p>I guess what I’m saying is everything is such a goddamn bummer. And now you guys aren’t even here anymore…why do I even want to live through the next decade? To be reminded how I squandered the last ten “normal” years? To say that I never traveled? To say that I didn’t go out and get up to enough mischief when I had the chance and said “I’ll just stay in and play video games, it’s cool, catch you next time” way too often?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here’s my FOMO. What if, lying on my deathbed, I realize that I didn’t read all the cool books I wanted to read, because I was wasting my time and energy out at stupid parties that I didn’t enjoy and knew I wouldn’t enjoy? Do you, and don’t apologize for doing it. Or, if you’re not happy, but you feel like you can’t change, maybe try therapy or other professional help, and don’t apologize for that, either.</p>
<p>And as for all the terrible shit happening right now? Every time some terrible shit like this happens, and people get really mad about it, there’s a very real opportunity for change. In the past, I’ve always let other people take up that mantle. For me, it’s too hard, too inconvenient, too dangerous, etc. And, the bad thing that happened always stresses me out and exhausts me, and I just don’t want to get involved.</p>
<p>This time, I’ve come through the stress and the exhaustion, and now I’m mad as hell. This was a super egregious police murder. At <em>least</em> as egregious as Eric Garner, and that was five years ago, and shit hasn’t improved in five fucking years? And our wannabe fascist commander-in-chief literally threatened, illegally (as if he knows, or cares), to deploy the military against peacefully protesting US citizens. This time I don’t think I can sit it out.</p>
<p>Participating in this doesn’t necessarily mean getting out in the streets. For example, one activist activity that’s happening in my city next week is a voter registration postcarding event, where people are going to sit around on a Zoom call and write postcards to people all over the country who aren’t registered to vote, telling them how they can register and vote in their area.</p>
<p>The next ten years certainly seem like they’re going to be depressing, and I don’t think the ten years after that are going to be much better – I think climate change is going to start biting us at least that early, if not earlier. But in ten years, I’ll be 41, and whatever else may come, at least I won’t be regretting sitting this one out.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, I’m not sure how many people here will still remember me. Things seem to move at a slower pace than they did back when I was around, and I’m seeing a significant lack of old faces. I’m seeing that this place is shutting down soon, too…which has added somewhat to my grievances against life that I’ll get into more detail below.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was just sitting here…heart surgery in less than a week…global pandemic raging like wildfire…American cities being burned to the ground by angry mobs regarding the police who are showing their true colors in how they respond to the peaceful protests…the last four years of my life “wasted” on becoming an attorney rather than…living? I don’t know. The next ten years are sure to be filled with economic and social upheaval. By the end of it I’ll be what, 40? I killed my last chance at some longterm romantic partnership probably when I broke up with my longterm girlfriend last year when she said she didn’t want kids because she didn’t know how the future would look. I called her pessimistic. Turns out she was right all along.</p>
<p>I guess what I’m saying is everything is such a goddamn bummer. And now you guys aren’t even here anymore…why do I even want to live through the next decade? To be reminded how I squandered the last ten “normal” years? To say that I never traveled? To say that I didn’t go out and get up to enough mischief when I had the chance and said “I’ll just stay in and play video games, it’s cool, catch you next time” way too often?</p>
<p>To answer my question about why I would want to go on living…I dunno…maybe I don’t. And where I had plenty of reasons not to go ahead with it in the past…I don’t see any of them now.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to capstone this forum’s life with such negative post. I needed to say something, guess I wanted to say it to the place, if not necessarily the people, I wanted to impress for some reason back in the mid 2000s. Hope you guys have a better decade than I’m counting on.</p>

            <p>10 minutes of Ravenholm outsourced made this NoClip worth it, but the rest was also good. Proves that Valve could have garnered so much good will by easily making HL3 or HL2Ep3 back when the iron was hot.<br>

            <p>Well, I’m an essential worker in a rural area, so things are basically “Business as usual but with more fear and handwashing”<br>
Customers don’t tend to practice social distancing and the only changes management made that weren’t mandated by the local health authority (almost entirely for checkout, so not my department) was ramping up purchasing on the stuff people were panic buying.</p>
<p>Also hi, I haven’t been posting here a whole lot in the past couple years, but I have been checking in. Gonna miss this place when it’s gone, even if it has already pretty well died.</p>

<p>Heh, that’s one way too look at it. Personally, I’m kinda sad that this place won’t get archived. I kind of have an outside-in view on the matter, but I personally see a rather rich history to this forum, and it’s sad to see that erased.</p>

</aside>
<p>For what it’s worth, black mesa’s discord community is rather nice. It might be worth giving it a chance.</p>
<p>Given that this place may be shut down soon, perhaps without warning, I might as well take this brief opportunity we have to ask how everyone is doing, given covid-19 and the lockdowns. How’s everyone holding up?</p>

For context; The Black Mesa steam forums and discord are being re-worked, and CC has a new official community manager.<br>
TLDR; this place is going to be shut down soon.</p>

            <p>Wow this place has changed since I last logged in, but I’m glad to see it’s relatively alive still. Loving the full release, even if it’s still technically a beta it’s fantastic. Xen has some serious “Metroid Prime” vibes, particularly Talon Overworld and Chozo Ruins imo.</p>
<p>Anyways, just thought I’d pop in cause it’d been a couple years. See ya’ll around the place.</p>
