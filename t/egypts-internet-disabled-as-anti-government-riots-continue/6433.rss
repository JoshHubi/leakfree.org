[QUOTE=A Comment on Slashdot]
Egyptian authorities apparently pulled the backbone plugs. [twitter.com] As a result of the Egyptians protesting, because the Tunisians protested, because of a Wikileaked document, from a US Embassy saying the truth - there was an old, fucked up dictatorship.

<p>In any case, I wonder if this is actually the start of something in the mid-east. Would be cool if it was, but I fear it may be short lived, especially if the governments succeed at limiting internet access.</p>

<p>It means that for the next few months, there will be no Egyptians playing video games on the internet. So if they were any better than South Koreans, that would actually mean something.</p>

<p>Actually, the US President always had that power since the advent of the Internet.  Nice spin.</p>
<p>That said, it will NEVER happen here.  The US relies too much on the economic stimulus created by the Internet and nearly every big company headquartered in the US relies on the Internet for major portions of revenue.  Take Amazon as a prime example.</p>
<p>No, it won’t happen; it’s just fearmongering by “zOMFG Odumbo’s shutting down the toobz!” people.</p>

            <p>The guard and the police are loyal to the president, and are unpopular with the people. Since the unrest began they’ve been using extremely heavy handed tactics. They’re also the kind gentleman that put electrodes on your teeth and bollocks when you’re in prison.</p>
<p>The army is seen in a much more favourable light, partly owing to their work in the war with Israel. Their loyalty will be crucial to the outcome of the unrest, but they’re liked by the people and not as heavy handed as the civil agencies. In fact, they used force against the border guards during their strikes in the early years of the president’s rule.</p>
<p>The army’s been deployed to Cairo, but they were greeted with cheering and it’s hoped they’ll keep the police in line</p>

            <p>Why doesn’t one of the Egyptian president’s loyal guards assassinate him and end it<br>
already? Come on, he’s been in power for 30 years, that’s way too long to remain objective, even for a biased point of view that’s bad.</p>

<p>The government issues instructions to ISPs and mobile phone networks to cut off internet access. Vodafone have released a statement saying that they have to comply, it’s the law. There’s no ‘big red button’</p>

<p>Actually, the US President always had that power since the advent of the Internet.  Nice spin.</p>
<p>That said, it will NEVER happen here.  The US relies too much on the economic stimulus created by the Internet and nearly every big company headquartered in the US relies on the Internet for major portions of revenue.  Take Amazon as a prime example.</p>
<p>No, it won’t happen; it’s just fearmongering by “zOMFG Odumbo’s shutting down the toobz!” people.</p>
