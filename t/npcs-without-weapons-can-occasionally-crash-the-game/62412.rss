    <title>NPCs without weapons can occasionally crash the game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/npcs-without-weapons-can-occasionally-crash-the-game/62412</link>
    <description>This issue relates to issue [62411](https://forums.blackmesasource.com/t/npcs-with-additionalequipment-weapons-keyvalue-0-cause-issues/62411).

If an NPC such as an `npc_human_grunt` doesn&#39;t have a weapon, and is aggressive towards the player, a crash can occur. The trigger is unknown, however I believe it has to do with attempting to throw a grenade and not null-checking the current weapon.

For reproducibility, see the issue linked at the top.

You can find the crash dump [here](https://content.jame.xyz/sharex/crash_bms.exe_20190707071346_1.dmp).
EDIT: You can find the crash dump for `public-beta` branch [here](https://content.jame.xyz/sharex/crash_bms.exe_20190708040539_1.dmp).</description>
