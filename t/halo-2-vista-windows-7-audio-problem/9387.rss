    <title>Halo 2 Vista - Windows 7 Audio Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/halo-2-vista-windows-7-audio-problem/9387</link>
    <description>[b][u]PLEASE HELP!!![/u][/b] Whenever I load Halo 2 Vista, the initial logos like &quot;Halo, Bungie Microsoft&quot; etc. have audio, I suspect it is because they are just video files. The loading screen does the same thing. But when in game or at the menu, there is no sound! I&#39;ve tried every single option in the game! I have played through Halo 2 Vista before on this same computer! But recently I had to re-install Windows 7, and my main drive is now an SSD. This problem is [b]very [/b]annoying, if anyone knows how to fix it, please respond! I use on board audio going out through my graphics card&#39;s HDMI port. It is a 5.1 speaker system, and I have no audio problems outside of this. The game runs &quot;fine&quot; otherwise (as well as H2 Vista ever runs).</description>
