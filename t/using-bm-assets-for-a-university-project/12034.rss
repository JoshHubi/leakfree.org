    <title>Using BM assets for a university project</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/using-bm-assets-for-a-university-project/12034</link>
    <description>Basically we&#39;re doing a senior project, a source mod, and we lack the resources and time to create something as high-quality as what Black Mesa, and we think our assessment might be looked on unfavourably should we move forward with pretty much skeleton maps.

Currently the plan is to submit our work while crediting the resources we used to the people who made them, we might distribute the project later, but that is up to how well it goes.

So I wanted to ask about restrictions and rules about using Black Mesa assets for another source mod, and if there&#39;s anything required other than giving credits to your team. Since they will be a huge help for us in terms of speeding up our work as well as making the entire project look much nicer.</description>

<p>He says that in his first post, and he’s also now seen the license text so will presumably will be complying with that.</p>

<p>The graphics and otherwise aesthetic aspects of the project will likely be ignored as we’re doing it for a Computer Science degree (in which we took 0 courses on 3D graphics), we’re just trying to cover our grounds in case we do get a strict assessment and they ignore our programming.</p>
