    <title>Hubicorn Needs PC Help &gt;:0</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hubicorn-needs-pc-help-0/4653</link>
    <description>Hello my lovely Unicorn lovers.

I am in dire need for some help.  Whoever helps me come to a solution I shall gift them [b]one free game  of their choice on [url=&#39;https://www.steamgames.com/&#39;]steam[/url][/b] and  grant them a [b]cool forum title.[/b]

[b]Here&#39;s the situation:[/b]

I  just got around to building a new computer. it&#39;s up and running but it  randomly turns off. The temps seem fine as well as the power supply.  Should the CPU be preforming at 70c+ when it&#39;s idle and 80c when playing  a video game? Playing a game does not cause it to randomly shut off. It  just does. It will shut down no matter what I am currently doing, even including playing video games. It would even just randomly shut off while watching a SD  video or being idle on the desktop. Sometimes it can last for a hour before turning off. The CPU is currently being cooled down with the intel stock  heatsink fan. Good? Bad? Could be a heating issue, could be bad memory. I have no idea.

[b]What&#39;s Inside:[/b]

[b]Case:[/b]  Ultra X-Blaster

<p>Hey Guys.</p>
<p>The issue was the PSU and memory timing. Everything seems to be working perfect now. I will announce the person who gets the free steam game by the end of the day.</p>

</aside>
<p>Good to hear!  Always glad to see someone fix their PC (especially when it’s something so annoying as random BSODS/resets).</p>
<p>As for a new HSF (heatsink/fan), I’d recommend something with direct heatpipes.  For my next build, I plan to use the Cooler Master Hyper 212+.  MaximumPC gave it a 10/10 + Kickass Award (which unfortunately caused NewEgg to double its price).  Nevertheless, you can find it on the interwebs for ~$30US, but it does require the removal of the motherboard.</p>
<p>So my recommendation for “the best” is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-RR-B10-212P-G1-Universal-Heat-Pipe/dp/B002G1YPH0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Hyper 212</a>, but in the interest of keeping your rig in one piece, I’d go with the Arctic Cooling Freezer 7 Pro.  I used it on a i5-750 build for a friend and it keeps it around 32°C idle; I’m using its “younger brother”, the Freezer 64, on my AMD build right now, and temps range from 38-45°C (in a 82°F room).</p>
<p>Installation is simple enough - push pins using the stock mounting bracket.  You can also orient the fan whichever direction you like (pending, of course, the height of your RAM and proximity of the MOSFETS to your CPU socket).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKWh24l5-tQ" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Installation video</a> and <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186134" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">where to buy it</a>.</p>

            <p>Glad you got it sorted!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>As for the CPU cooler, I would recommend <a href="https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=HS-067-AK&amp;groupid=701&amp;catid=57&amp;subcat=1395" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> beast. My brother is currently using it for his i7 3.4ghz machine and it keeps the temps very low (not sure on the exact temperature range) but it is very quiet at speed. Looks cool aswell.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I believe you might need to remove the motherboard for this one, it is definitely worth it though.</p>

            <p>Next time don’t forget to set the timings and voltages for your memory. This is a must. The auto settings of the motherboard can cause lots of stability problems as they tend to jump a lot or pump way too much voltage through the RAM then needed (especially when you’ve got a CPU with integrated memory controller like the Intel i7’s).</p>
<p>If you’re too lazy to do that, buy X.M.P memory next time lol.</p>

<li>I’m sure you installed them, being the webmaster and as such, a tech oriented guy, but just in case; Standoffs. If you haven’t put the standoffs in the motherboard, do so NOW. (I stress this, because I had no idea they existed when I put together my first computer a few months ago and as such almost fried my brand-new motherboard)</li>
<li>Check all the connections inside, make sure they are snug.</li>

<p>I doubt you did anything wrong building it, but perhaps there was something you missed. I dunno.</p>

            <p>Hmmm… I had a problem like this with My old PC.<br>
Incase you haven’t fixed it already, when it shuts down does it have an orange/amber light near/on the power button? If so it’s almost guaranteed a heat problem. My old PC did that and I “fixed” the problem by having a small fan blow air right into the PC and that worked almost flawlessly. It wasn’t a good fix but it held me over till I was able to afford a new HDD (I think that was it).</p>

<p>You’re overreacting. It’s almost impossible keep a CPU like that at 30 degrees idle with stock cooling. When overclocking people try to keep it below 80 C while running a Prime95 stress test to ensure maximum stability. When you’re pumping a high voltage through the CPU for your overclock then idle temperatures could easily be around 40 degrees unless you go for water cooling.</p>
<p>Cooling the CPU MOSFET’s would be way more important at higher voltages, not to mention the actual Tj Max for most CPU’s is unknown or varies from each model (meaning core temperatures, especially at idle can be highly innacurate depending on the TJ Max you’ve set in the monitoring program). The sensors were meant to make sure the CPU starts throttling when it roughly hits the thermal threshold, not to accurately display core temperatures.</p>

<p>He is getting 50ºC at idle after he turned off Intel turbo boost. Normal idle temps for the i7-860 are on the 30’s… Ok, higher 30’s, but still 30’s. I guess after being powered on for a while/in the summer it’s normal if it goes over 40, but shortly (not immediately) after booting up it should be under that.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s idle which doesn’t mean that much, and that’s why I told him to run OCCT for a few minutes. Now, if he gets near 80ºC under load, with no OC, I think we can agree the cooler isn’t dissipating the heat very well and his CPU is probably gonna start throttling down. It’s not gonna harm it, but under normal conditions it shouldn’t do that.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to alarm him, or tell him is CPU is gonna blow, just that if it’s idling at 50ºC he should check it under load before dismissing overheating, because 50ºC at idle is still a lot for that specific CPU.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>50ºC at idle is still VERY hot for a CPU with a <a href="https://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx?id=41316" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">thermal design of 72.7ºC</a> (at that temperature the CPU starts throttling down or simply shuts itself off). Temps for the i7-860 should be around 30ºC and probably never going over 40ºC (idling).</p>
<p>Before you rule out overheating, I would recommend you to run <a href="https://www.ocbase.com/perestroika_en/index.php?Download" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">OCCT</a>or a similar app for a few minutes and see what kind of temperatures you get.</p>
<p>If it goes over 70ºC, you’ve probably got a problem (probably a cooler installation one. you really have to press hard on those springs), even if it’s not what’s causing the shutdowns.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re overreacting. It’s almost impossible keep a CPU like that at 30 degrees idle with stock cooling. When overclocking people try to keep it below 80 C while running a Prime95 stress test to ensure maximum stability. When you’re pumping a high voltage through the CPU for your overclock then idle temperatures could easily be around 40 degrees unless you go for water cooling.</p>
<p>Cooling the CPU MOSFET’s would be way more important at higher voltages, not to mention the actual Tj Max for most CPU’s is unknown or varies from each model (meaning core temperatures, especially at idle can be highly innacurate depending on the TJ Max you’ve set in the monitoring program). The sensors were meant to make sure the CPU starts throttling when it roughly hits the thermal threshold, not to accurately display core temperatures.</p>

            <p>Just a side note here, Hubi - I don’t think the temperatures you are seeing are unreasonable…I’m running an i7 950 in my laptop and routinely get temperatures of around 70-75 on startup. I’d be more inclined to think that the voltages are your culprit.</p>

<p>Sounds about right.  Like I said in my last post, memory timings and voltage can cause some crazy problems.  As a test, you can run Prime95 (or the CPU/memory stress test of your choice) with and without the Turbo Boost and automatic system overclock enabled.</p>
<p>I’ve seen motherboards that do across-the-board percentage-based overclocks - is that what yours is doing?</p>

<p>If you don’t manage to fix the problem this way, I’d recommend checking the Intel website to see if it is possible to turn off the automatic overclocking the mobo seems to want to implement.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Actually thinking about it I don’t think it is the power supply, considering the system usually fully boots up without a hitch.</p>
<p>Hubi, are you sure you didn’t scratch the motherboard with a screwdriver or something when installing any components? :fffuuu:</p>
<p>I’d check for minute scratches around the processor or the PCI ports, only other thing it could really be is a defective motherboard that needs replacing.</p>
<p>Good luck on your mission sir!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Some pretty good suggestions so far, but it’s a bit hard to tell from all your posts (Hubi) what you’ve been able to test and/or rule out.  Did you rule the memory out with an overnight of memtest86?</p>
<p>Your CPU is still running a bit hot.  The i-series SHOULD have pretty good thermals at stock speeds, but it also helps to have a good HSF with quality, correctly-applied thermal paste.  The application techniques vary (one rice-grain sized stripe, 3 rice-grain sized stripes, one pea-sized dot in the center, apply and spread with credit card, etc) but I usually go with the dot in the middle and let the HSF spread it out.  With an AMD X2 6000+ stock clocked, Arctic Cooling Freezer 64 and Artic Silver 5 in a 80°F environment, my CPU sits around 39°C.  That i7-860 should be a few degrees cooler than that, especially if you have a cooler environment.</p>
<p>Double check EVERY power cable in your system, especially those powering important components (24-pin motherboard, 8-pin CPU, 2x6-pin GPU) but also your drives.  And double-check means unplug, blow in the socket, and reseat until it clicks.</p>
<p>Go through your BIOS and check for power management settings on the CPU and memory.  First your CPU voltage was 1.16, the last screenshot is 1.09, that’s a bit much of a jump (if you didn’t adjust it yourself).  Double and triple check your memory timings - a few years back, I had WEEKS of unpredictable hard-resetting, BSODS saying IRQ_LESS_OR_EQUAL (which is usually heat-related), and general shitty performance all because my uncle had overclocked my memory by FIVE MEGAHERTZ!  It didn’t matter if I was gaming, writing a paper, watching a movie, or idling, it would just reset whenever it felt like it.</p>
<p>Also, using <a href="https://extreme.outervision.com/PSUEngine" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this here</a> I roughly calculated your minimum PSU to require around 450 Watts, and that DOESN’T account for system load (which with your GPU and CPU can jump another few dozen watts, if not 100+).  You could try swapping out the GPU for a less power-hungry model.  And while we’re discussing power, are you running your system on a surge protector and/or UPS?  Before I had my UPS, my system would sometimes hard-lock and/or hard-reset when my sister turned on her blow dryer.  Especially now that it’s summer time, people are running their AC, the power companies are browning out the grid (in the US, anyway) - it’s crucial to have clean power via UPS or at least surge protected.</p>
<p>In short, here’s a summary of issues that cause random hard-resets:</p>
<ul>
<li>High temperatures</li>
<li>Improper memory timings (under-or-overclocked, voltage, etc)</li>
<li>Improperly seated power cables</li>
<li>Not enough quality power delivered to the system (UPS or different PSU)</li>
<li>Not enough power in general (remove GPU, try different PSU)</li>
<li>IRQ Conflicts (in extreme cases, try removing all unnecessary hardware)</li>
</ul>
