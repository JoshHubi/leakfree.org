    <description>On Questionable ethics I got a bit lost and did not realise I needed to put the blast shield plug out.

Anyway after trying to find out what I needed going back and fourth loading in the other area down the stairs  I realised what I needed to do but the Machine with the buttons on it went transparent to fire the laser and the wall that gets a hole melted into it did not appear either but I could get through.

Also loading back and fourth between surface tension and QE I lost alot of my weapons they simply disappeared alltogether.

Mines and mine fields also cause a lot of lag</description>
