    <description>Talk about the last film you saw and rate it.

For me, It was &quot;When did you last see your father&quot;

I rate it.. I dunno, I can&#39;t really rate it.

I never cry and this film made me drown. :[</description>

            <p>Män som hatar kvinnor - 4/4</p>
<p>Excellent film. I tend to get antsy when films run over 2 hours, but I was completely enthralled by it beginning to end. Is the American version any good?</p>

            <p>I just started watching the 1979 miniseries adaptation of “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” with Alec Guinness as George Smiley. It’s really convoluted and tough to follow, but that generally is the norm for John Le Carre adaptations. It’s got that “Wire” appeal where it throws you into a jargon heavy universe and expects the audience to pay attention. It’s a rare show that not only respects the audience’s intelligence, but also basically requires it.</p>

            <p>I think what I appreciated most about Super 8 was [COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#151515</span>’]the fact that Louis Dainard, Alice Dainard’s father, wasn’t a stereotypical Hollywood-style child abuser.  All signs were pointing to that with how he treated Alice and Joe and the fact that he was apparently a depressed alcoholic; though with what happened with Jackson’s wife, I’m not surprised.  In the scene right before Alice ran away, Louis tried to get Alice to come over to him and he wasn’t too nice about it.  I was so expecting Louis to get up and storm over to Alice and start hitting her.  I’m so glad that didn’t happen and, after Alice ran away, he genuinely seemed worried about her as he chased after her.  That scene, while not a nice scene by any stretch of the imagination, was probably one of my favorites in the movie.  The other scene which is, in my opinion, one of the best was [COLOR=’<span class="hashtag">#151515</span>’]the interactions between Charles and his family and how the Kaznyks treated Joe.  Awesome job there, guys, even though you guys only had a few short scenes.</p>
<p>All-in-all, a great movie.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Super 8 was interesting. A few things happened that I wasn’t quite expecting, even though the movie as a whole was pretty much what I was expecting.</p>
<p>I am surprised I didn’t hear a single spoiler for it. It’s not like I was even trying to avoid spoilers for it.</p>

            <p>Coma - the miniseries… not even fucking close, to the original… and it would really be a shame if this was Tony Scott’s last project. It was way too busy and scattershot. Was sort of a chore to watch. Was your basic tv movie. And above all else, was not terribly suspenseful. Richard Dreyfuss was about the only good thing about it. He gave a nice little performance at the end. Oh my, and Gena Davis… eeks. She is just scary anymore. She has obviously had multiple plastic surgeries and the end result is not good. And she is playing a cougar, that beds two younger dudes. This was actually the scariest part of the whole fuckin’ 2-night miniseries!!</p>
<p>But the original Coma, if you guys have not seen it, kicks complete ass. Very suspenseful, and does not come off as terribly dated ( 1978 ). Written and directed by Michael Critchton. Music by Jerry Goldsmith (Alien). Check it out if you get the chance… The medical thriller which all else are measured by. Hell, I think I will watch it again soon (own dvd). Have not seen it in at least 5 years. Book is really good too, as is most of Robin Cook’s.</p>

            <p>Mission Impossible. Don’t know how I hadn’t seen it yet, so I finally watched it when I saw it was on Netflix. It was…alright. While it’s still iconic, seeing it now after seeing the latest installments is a bit…underwhelming I suppose.</p>

            <p>Despite not having seen the first one, a friend talked me into seeing <span class="bbcode-i">Expendables 2</span> for lack of a better option.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had like 2 hours to kill until the showing. So we ducked in on <span class="bbcode-i">Premium Rush</span> to pass the time … that one was empty, so our presence kept the projector from working for an empty room. I certainly wasn’t planning on catching that movie in theater considering its disregard for logic.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of my movie-night: Recognizing a Manchester Orchestra song playing in the background of a noisy bar scene in that bike movie. That song’s title was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBmizSr9Urg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pensacola</a>”, the city I’m in. The movie takes place in NYC (like every other movie), so having “Pensacola” play in a place so populated made me feel relevant.</p>

            <p>Let Me In</p>
<p>It was pretty cool and there were a lot of disturbing parts in it. I have been meaning to watch the Swedish movie it was based on for a while. I need to get around to that.</p>

            <p>I saw a movie called <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Starcrash</span></span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR-SSpuwjzk" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">[watch it here]</a></p>
<p>It actually made sense to me. 4/4 stars, would suggest to friends an enemies alike.</p>

            <p>Haywire. Decent plot. Great fight scenes. Wide shots, and simple cuts that allow you to see the action, and keep it simple so you know what is going on. And finally a woman that has some muscle, and looks like she can kick a man’s ass (yes, I know Gina Carrano was a cage fighter).</p>

<p>I guess the last movies I saw were Puss In Boots and Jackie Chan’s The Master. Puss was ok, but The Master wasn’t even really a Chan movie. It’s about a 16 year old boy that is obsessed with Jackie and trying to meet him, at the detriment of the rest of his life, even getting him kidnapped and held hostage. I didn’t finish watching it, it was so dumb.</p>

<p>A friend of mine worked on Puss in Boots.  He was the film’s editor.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
