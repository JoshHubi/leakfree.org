    <description>So..... about developer commentaries in Black Mesa. After seeing the commentaries of Hezus&#39; Uplink remake, what are your thoughts on this? Should it be included or not (if they have at all?).</description>

            <p>Oh, my bad. :\ It’d be nice if we could get a dev’s opinion or word on the subject, but they’re all probably busy jizzing all over Xen.</p>

            <p>Are you implying it should be? Because it shouldn’t. They have absolutely no obligations to anyone at all.</p>
<p>Also, I seem to remember a dev saying they were discussing it and that some devs wanted to do it, but I’m not sure.</p>

            <p>Developer commentary was one of the things I was most looking forward to whilst Black Mesa was still unreleased. I knew the game would be great no matter what, but was excited to hear their reasoning behind what they changed and the processes they went through over such a long development. Was kinda sad when I first loaded up and saw there wasn’t any commentary, they must have some great “war stories” they could tell…</p>
<p>On that note, what happened to those posts Raminator said they’d do showing the progression of different levels over the years?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yes, please! I’d rather have commentaries than Xen even. I know that dichotomy doesn’t make sense, but it shows how important it is to me. Since Black Mesa is a modern re-imagining of a classic, the process of its creation is just as interesting (if not more so, in some ways) as the experience of the finished product itself.</p>
<p>So, yes, I’m happy they’re working on Xen, but I’d be ecstatic If I knew that we would be hearing the dev’s voices on the myriad of decisions they had to make. Think about it. It’s not only the technical sides of level design, but how they tried to give those levels a better sense of “place” by making them more authentic, and how they expanded the script without falling on fanboyism (“ooooh, here’s Breen saying hello”.)</p>
<p>To sum up: I really, really hope that at least some of the devs take some time to give us at least some developer commentaries.</p>
