</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As a final retort, a high end PC with half way decent specs will cost anywhere near $1000, home consoles cost half that much. Now, I did spend $1000 on an excellent laptop that can handle anything I throw at it (save for Crysis – but who wants to a play a game for graphics anyways), and I purchased all my consoles with my own money (not all at once, of course), and I don’t exactly have disposable income.</p>
<p>The only ones I didn’t pay for was my N64 and SNES. I was gifted with a PSone, but I traded my brother for the 64 because I favored Nintendo’s system over Sony’s. And I was randomly given the SNES with twenty some odd games. I traded about 3/4 of the games to get $40 in-store credit, which was phenomenal.</p>
<p>I’ll give you one thing, emulation does have its advantages, however nothing outweighs the satisfaction of playing a classic game on its home console.</p>

<p>What do you find wrong with it?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t know, it seems like it’s too easy for noobs to just spam the fire button while running around aimlessly. Perhaps I’m doing it wrong, but I try to line up my shots while aiming AND moving to avoid being hit. Although I think I’m pretty accurate with the headshots, I seem to be defeated easily by the players who do nothing more than spray fire without aiming.</p>
<p>Also, the spawning is pretty bad - I’ve had instances where I’ll spawn in the same area with a guy with a golden gun multiple times in a row. I know that’s a difficult thing to code, but man it sucks when you get spawn killed by a golden gun 3 times in a row!</p>
<p>All in all, I guess I can’t complain too much because it is a mod and they did do a decent job on emulating the original. I’m just still trying to decide if adding 16 additional players breaks the gameplay that made the original so much fun.</p>

            <p>Wasn’t aware that they were out of Beta. Nice. I shall be joining the fray sometime soon here, once the download has completed.</p>
<p>btw, for those who don’t know, Goldeneye 007 for the Wii isn’t exactly a remake (like what Goldeneye Source essentially is), it’s more of a remimagining of the original script with Daniel Craig instead of Pierce Brosnan. Works really well, and the online component was put together expertly. I love it, but GE: Source is the place to go for HD remade levels from the original.</p>
<p>And if you haven’t played the original on an actual N64, shame on you for using an emulator.</p>

<p>Well guess what it isn’t. There’s still 6-7 maps missing, 2 weapons are still being working on (the tazor boy and the lazer watch) and let’s not talk about the characters.</p>
<p>Trust me it’s gonna be long. :3</p>

            <p>I played it for awhile before. I always seemed to get the Golden Gun which allowed me to own everyone else :awesome: . The only thing I found wrong with it was that you could kill someone on the other side of a stage with a pistol if you wanted to. I might redownload it soon.</p>

            <p>Since the 4.1 release (that came out like one week ago), the mod is no longer in beta and there is a shit load of people playing it. No wonder why Goldeneye : Source is number 1 on moddb (I voted for it).</p>
