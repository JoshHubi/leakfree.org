    <title>What is your love language?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-your-love-language/12340</link>
    <description>Alright, this is something I&#39;m kind of curious about. I&#39;ve noticed there have been a lot of relationship troubles within this forum ranging from not knowing how to handle a specific situation with a girlfriend, all the way down to causing women to hide and flee when you enter the room. 

This page: [url]https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/singles/[/url] 

is a questionnaire that will help you pin point the ways you yourself feel appreciated, and it will also help you be aware of all the ways other people show  and feel affection.

I&#39;m curious to know what everyone is going to get. I&#39;m going to guess that physical contact is going to score very highly here. I scored a 12 in quality time, and a 9 in physical contact, but I took this test a while ago before I was engaged in a relationship, and physical contact was at 11 or something, because I was feeling starved for it I guess. 

Anyways, just answer the questions honestly and post your scores/discuss anything related.

I got 
12 quality time
9 physical contact
and the others were all very low, I don&#39;t remember the exact numbers because it was a little while ago that I did it.  :stuck_out_tongue:  Words of affirmation was the next in order, I know that.</description>

            <p>11 physical touch<br>
10 quality time<br>
&lt;5 everything else<br>
As expected, the quiz doesn’t seem to tell you something about yourself you couldn’t come up with on your own.<br>
EDIT: shit, sorry for the necro, it’s late and I didn’t notice.</p>

            <p>So I guess I don’t like gifts. Doesn’t suprise me, I’ve never really understood the reason for giving people gifts at christmas, birthdays or whatever other reasons there are. I can’t remember if I ever appreciated a gift in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>I appreciate time spent together and people caring for me, nothing new here. Words don’t mean jackshit to me, the only reason it even have score here is because I found the alternatives lacking and picked the closest one.</p>
<p>To be honest this didn’t teach me anything new, I’ve spent so much time thinking through the years.<br>
If you don’t know who you are yourself, how are you supposed to learn to know someone else?</p>

            <p>Yeah, quizes aren’t the best way to figure out people’s mentality, just an outline.</p>
<p>Anyway:<br>
8Words of Affirmation<br>
11Quality Time<br>
1Receiving Gifts<br>
5Acts of Service<br>
5Physical Touch</p>
<p>Quality time, I’m less concerned about words though… it’s prolly because it was the one “random” answer I chose since there wasn’t anything else.</p>

            <p>i dont really understand my score<br>
You are most like: CHANDLER</p>
<p>How sure are we? BARELY</p>
<p>Like Chandler, you consider yourself the only “normal” member of your social group. And considering how strange your parents were, that’s quite an achievement. Always keeping a sense of humor, your intelligence shows in your quick retorts and use of sarcasm. Despite your hard shell, however, you have surprising depths of emotion and sympathy, proving to be an excellent friend.</p>

            <p>Alright, this is something I’m kind of curious about. I’ve noticed there have been a lot of relationship troubles within this forum ranging from not knowing how to handle a specific situation with a girlfriend, all the way down to causing women to hide and flee when you enter the room.</p>
<p>This page: <a href="https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/singles/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/singles/</a></p>
<p>is a questionnaire that will help you pin point the ways you yourself feel appreciated, and it will also help you be aware of all the ways other people show  and feel affection.</p>
<p>I’m curious to know what everyone is going to get. I’m going to guess that physical contact is going to score very highly here. I scored a 12 in quality time, and a 9 in physical contact, but I took this test a while ago before I was engaged in a relationship, and physical contact was at 11 or something, because I was feeling starved for it I guess.</p>
<p>Anyways, just answer the questions honestly and post your scores/discuss anything related.</p>
<p>I got<br>
12 quality time<br>
9 physical contact<br>
and the others were all very low, I don’t remember the exact numbers because it was a little while ago that I did it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Words of affirmation was the next in order, I know that.</p>
