    <title>Hedgehog in the Fog: The Game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hedgehog-in-the-fog-the-game/8991</link>
    <description>Hello folks,

I have released my first public version of a game our two people team has been working on for the past five months. It&#39;s a side-scrolling mobile game for Android phones. Would be cool if you could check it out and tell me what you think.

<p>Actually, you’re totally right Medevilae.  It needs LOTS of fog.  It would be great if parts of the game were entirely in fog and you could only see silhouettes of the hedgehog and the course.  If you could get up high enough you would eventually make it out of the fog.</p>
<p>As it stands, it’s just another angrybirds style game with a hedgehog in it.  Not that it’s bad, because it does look nice, it just has only a tenuous link to it’s subject matter.</p>
<p>Much more could be done with the fog and incorporated into the game mechanics.  THEN you would have something original and awesome.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Understood. But I guess that would change the whole game at this point. Maybe we’ll try something a bit more original next time.</p>

            <p>Yozhik v tumane is a pretty awesome cartoon.  Although in your game there isn’t very much fog.  You’ve come reasonably close with the art style though.</p>

<p>It’s not SEGA or Sonic related. The similarity is just a coincidence. It’s all based on an old Soviet animation with the same name.</p>
