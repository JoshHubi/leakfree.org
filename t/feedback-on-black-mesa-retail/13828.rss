    <title>Feedback on Black Mesa retail</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/feedback-on-black-mesa-retail/13828</link>
    <description>(Already posted this on the Steam discussion board, but I like to be redundant. I&#39;m also updating this post as I think of and discover more things.)

Just played the first couple chapters, and I am enjoying it so far. I&#39;d like to give my feedback on some of the changes (later when I have time I can give screenshots and video of the specific things I&#39;m referring to, for clarity):

Things I liked:
1. The added dialogue in the room where the guard and the scientist bet on Gordon showing up; i.e. the female scientist overhearing the conversation and bursting out laughing. I felt like her laugh and facial animations were a bit overdone, but overall it was a good addition.
1. Perhaps this was in the mod too, but the scientist going over Dr. Cross pickup lines. (I had only ever heard this when I actually checked out the game&#39;s audio files.)
1. The change in what happens when you put on the HEV suit. My jaw dropped. Awesome!
1. The change in how the vortigaunts approach you during the resonance cascade. I didn&#39;t even know this was something the game needed, until I saw it.
1. The addition to the security guard&#39;s dialogue after you blow up the casserole. &quot;Because that was...&#39;you-know-who&#39;s&#39; lunch.&quot; Hehe!
1. The option for auto crouch-jump. *prostrates self before the crouch-jump gods*
1. The little GUI changes that make this feel more like [i]your[/i] game.
Things I didn&#39;t like:
1. The change in the title screen, which used to be bigger and more ethereal. Now it looks smaller, blockier (more solid), and not nearly as cool. Also, the ghostly sound which plays during the title screen used to play as the title was fading in; now there&#39;s a delay and it&#39;s a bit jarring. (Though maybe that was a bug.)
1. The options menu is translucent, which means the main menu background and text can clutter it and make it hard to read.
1. One of the scientists who lets you into the test chamber now has an English accent, instead of Sisk&#39;s voice work from the mod. I suddenly felt like I was in [i]The Stanley Parable[/i]. It&#39;s not that the voice work was bad; I just don&#39;t think the voice suits him.
1. Kleiner&#39;s lab coat being like everyone else&#39;s now. In the mod, his is buttoned up. It makes him stand out, it&#39;s in-character, and it provides a good contrast with Eli. It makes sense for it to at least be the same length as the others (in the mod it&#39;s shorter than the rest, and that bothered me), but I think it would be better if it were still buttoned up. Something about his facial design and animation was kind of weird, too. Definitely preferred his appearance in the mod.
1. It sounds like the HEV suit voice is different, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good change. I remember someone in another thread said it &quot;sounds like funny child&quot;. That&#39;s about the best comparison I can think of.
1. Is it just me, or do loading screens take EVEN LONGER now? D:  I assume there are more resources to load now, but [i]oh my God[/i] does it ever break the flow. I don&#39;t imagine there&#39;s much that can be done about it, so I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m griping, but there you go.
1. The new HEV suit model. It certainly looks cool, but in the mod I liked that it was very noticeably different from the Mark V. To be honest, in my mind, pretty much any detail that highlights how much things change between [i]Black Mesa[/i]/[i]Half-Life[/i] and [i]Half-Life 2[/i], and reinforces the sense of the passage of time, is an awesome detail. (Examples: G-Man&#39;s model re-skinned with darker colours to match his [i]Half-Life[/i] model; Eli and Kleiner being actually redesigned to look younger, not merely re-skinned.) So the mod&#39;s HEV suit model was a source of much appreciation and satisfaction. And now it&#39;s goooone. :&lt;
1. Some of the changes (like the HEV suit model change, some of the other model, texture, and layout changes) feel like they are trying to make [i]Black Mesa[/i] more like [i]Half-Life[/i], at least visually. I&#39;m sure many would love that, but I emphatically wouldn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t fall in love with [i]Black Mesa[/i] for the ways it was similar to [i]Half-Life[/i]. I fell in love with it for the ways that it was different. I loved it because it was its own, it was unique, and it wasn&#39;t trying to be [i]Half-Life[/i] with graphical improvements. It was so much more than that. I&#39;d just…like it to remain more than that. Obviously, the visuals aren&#39;t everything, and are far from the only thing that made [i]Black Mesa[/i] such a great experience. But I started gaming in 2010, have played mostly post-2005, first-person games, and am a pretty fussy person. To me, appearance and imagery does count for a lot. So it would make me very sad to see [i]Black Mesa[/i] shed its wonderfully unique, distinctive look in favour of visual atavisms.
Things I&#39;m ambivalent about:
1. The layout and texture changes are interesting. I have somewhat mixed feelings, but they still look neat!
1. I have mixed feelings about Gordon gasping in pain when he&#39;s burned. On the one hand, it&#39;s kind of thrilling to hear a tiny bit of voice from an otherwise silent protagonist, like Chell&#39;s pain sounds in [i]Portal[/i]. On the other hand, I feel like he should never have more voice than the breathing during the resonance cascade. It just feels taboo somehow. &gt;.&gt;  But I wouldn&#39;t want it to disappear... Ideally I would want it to be optional.  [img]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/biggrin.png[/img]
1. The guy who mentions Gordon&#39;s ponytail, having his voice filtered because of the speaker. On the one hand, it makes sense (I always wondered how you could hear him that well through solid glass), but I dunno, it just feels weird. I think a lot of my feelings are just resistance to change. I think this one will grow on me. It was just a bit startling the first time around.
1. Flashlight! Forgot about the flashlight. It just seems…so dark now. ; _ ;  And so small. But it also feels less ridiculous and more realistic, so I&#39;m torn. All I&#39;ll say is, when I first turned it on, I didn&#39;t actually realize it had worked.
1. The loading screen when you start a new game. On the one hand, it&#39;s cute, and is one of the aforementioned details that make [i]Black Mesa[/i] feel like a Crowbar Collective game, rather than a Valve game. But on the other hand, it feels a bit gimmicky and silly. One of the things that roped me into [i]Black Mesa[/i] is that it felt much more immersive, as well as much [url=&#39;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier&#39;]Darker and Edgier[/url], than [i]Half-Life[/i]. That loading screen kind of pulled me out of that.
All in all, still the [i]Black Mesa[/i] I know and love! I will post more as I continue to play!</description>

            <p>I have to say, performance has really improved since 2012! In the 2012 version, my game would practically crash when the cargo tram crashed through the wall, now there was barely a stutter.<br>
Plus the ambiance of the game is majorly improved! I loved the mantas and the jets flying around in Surface Tension.</p>

            <p>Ok so, sorry to say but in the retail version I really dislike fighting Marines. There’s a couple reasons for this.</p>
<p>For one, the marines still feel too accurate. Maybe that’s just me, if so, that’s fine. What’s more annoying is the fact that whenever they hit you a blood particle effect comes out of the player. This ALWAYS blocks my vision and makes firing back difficult, especially when combined with the screen shake that comes from being shot. It turns a battle into a panic as they rush in and shoot non-stop.</p>
<p>This also has a lot to do with their AI.  The marines are either strafing wildly or charging in. The strafing is annoying but I can excuse it. It’s the constant charging. Combined with the screen shake and blood effects, it really ends up making the fights more or less play out the same way:  me getting shot and firing blindly until I run out of ammo and have to sprint away.</p>
<p>I love the game overall but this one issue kind of makes it less fun to me. If there was no blood to block my view it would probably be fine. On their own these issues wouldn’t be enough make it less fun, but combined it makes combat with marines more frustrating than anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, love the game! Just feel like it could use some balancing. Keep up the good work guys, thanks!</p>

            <p>I think it’d be nice if one could change crosshairs and crosshair colours in BM. I’d also appreciate it if the settings on the “Black Mesa” options tab would be retained after relaunching the game. I also found most aliens (I don’t remember if the humans also did this) would often stare at me without doing anything. Sometimes it happens after I “surprise them”, which I guess is a natural reaction. Sometimes they just can’t figure out their way around objects. Sometimes I’m just too far away, even if I’m in plain sight. Sometimes, I’m right next to them and they won’t do anything.</p>
<p>This last thing made fights with alien grunts particularly easy.</p>
<p>Aside from those nit-picks, I have very much enjoyed the retail version! :3</p>

            <p>Tbh I don’t mind bhopping in single or multiplayer… Doesn’t matter… Maybe make bhop in singleplayer an unlockable option… like… you have to finish the game without bhop first… and after you finished it you unlock bhop for singleplayer to speedrun the game even more spectacular…</p>

            <p>Oh I forgot theres a whole speed running community as well.<br>
Guess it be a good idea to have two boxes checkable for single player like.</p>
<p>[] Enable Bunnyhopping<br>
[] Enable gauss jumping</p>
<p>Add some speed running achievements like bronze, silver and gold medal.<br>
Making a completion time for gold medal really difficult.<br>
Like it would take 1-2 years for people to find of ways for someone to finally step up and get that gold medal.<br>
Making it showable.</p>
<p>Notice: I am contradicting myself from another thread where I mentioned bunnyhopping shouldn’t be in single player.<br>
I still on a personal level prefer that single player integrity.<br>
That you know any achievements from the single player were achieved without such settings enabled.<br>
But that is forgetting about a bunch of player activity so Id suggest to be able to see if someone completed the game as a speed running or as original.<br>
That would be perfect!</p>

            <p>Sorry for dishing out so many fucking bugs, but this one is pretty game breaking if you use it in the right way. It seems to be left over from HL2. If you press your crouch key, then release it before your character gets back up to full standing height, about 88% to standing height as a rough estimate, then quickly hold crouch, you will be walking at crouch speed, but your view will be above what it should be, almost appearing as if you were slowly walking. You have to time it correctly so you are taller than crouch height, but still shorter than standing height. It is tricky, but really possible. What makes it gamebreaking in both singleplayer and multiplayer if you do this next to a vent or a confined place that requires you to crawl, then go into it, your view will clip into the world and you can see the contents of the whole map, and probably even other players before they can even anticipate you, because your player box is in crouch height to fit in the vent or hole, but your view is higher than that. I haven’t had much time to experiment in multiplayer, but does definitely work in both modes.</p>

            <p>There’s a few problems/oversights in the options menu of the game, first and obvious ones being that some settings in the Black Mesa tab don’t work and don’t stick when you relaunch the game. Some of the keybinding options don’t stick after launch as well. In the Mouse tab, there are useless text boxes that don’t do anything, and if they do, they are in the wrong places and appear non-functional. Also, there are some old and redundant keybinding settings left over from HL2 that didn’t get removed, like weapon catagory 6, and send/recall squad. I also don’t see the option to rebind the default chat key. One last thing, there are some contradictory settings. Going to Keyboard then Advanced, there is an option to enable quickswitch of weapons, however, in the Black Mesa tab, this setting is also present. And in the Difficulty tab, the easy setting claims the computer will help you aim, yet there is a toggleable setting in the BM tab.</p>

<p>I’m not 100% sure but i’ve noticed this and it may have something to do with quickloads. As in, the ragdolls look fine and normal, then i do something bad and hit the quickload key and then they are all spazzed out/halfway in the floor/etc just like that picture.</p>

            <p>actually, not really. yes it would result in some one getting shot to death cause they thought medics had only glocks, but seeing as things like the gaurds have better weapons as the events go on it would almost be expected for the medics to pick up better weapons… hell giving them the weapon pick up function from hl2 would even be nice, having the medics in the first incounters take their buddies guns and start unloading on the player would be cool.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aka limit medics to glocks in the first encounters in we got hostiles but later during the surface tension levels give them the mp5’s and shotguns again (enough dead soldiers or scared medics would arm them selves)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Feasible from a real-world perspective, but a bad idea from a gameplay perspective. By giving them glocks in the early game, you train the player to expect them to carry a glock. The first time the player encounters the medics in later stages, she may approach them thinking they’re carrying glocks and aren’t a threat, only to be killed or severely injured by medics that are carrying heavier weapons. This would be frustrating and unintuitive, as you’d have changed the established gameplay rules out from underneath the player.</p>

            <p>In the original Half-Life, I kinda remember that those Assassins are capable of throwing grenades at you. Any chances of bringing it back (if possible)??</p>
<p>BTW, I just noticed that Snarks have a secondary function: Its function is to throw them near you.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>There are a few AI “issues” I’ve found (not sure if they’ve been mentioned yet).</p>
<p>Assassins are insanely stupid, they just stand afar and shoot so they’re easy shots for the crossbow. They used to feel a little trickier if I remember. Also do they not cloak on Normal difficulty? Maybe I’m imagining it but on the mod I seem to remember them doing it. I’ll check for myself shortly but as is I killed all 4 of them in Apprehension within 20 seconds because it’s like they’re complete morons now.</p>
<p>Likewise, Vorts also just got dropped on their heads as kids or something. They’ll just stand and attack without moving usually, and then sometimes just turn into a brick. As in they literally just stop doing ANYTHING but stand on the spot.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the HECU doesn’t absolutely make me want to not play anymore. They’re definitely more reasonable and fun. The MP5 was kind of overpowered but it’s been tweaked in a patch since I had first started so it’s more reasonable. Shotgun got a tiny buff which is nice, but I still honestly never use it except against houndeyes and that’s it.<br>
Will update with more stuff later.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have played the first few chapters of the EA release and I was blown away (again).  Black Mesa just looks and plays so good (it also makes me wish I had a better computer so I could play BM in its full glory). Out of the lots of things I liked there are a few things that I disliked.</p>
<p>-The shotgun. It just didnt feel like it should feel. I think the Shotgun in Half-Life 2 and its Episodes and the one in the old Version of Black Mesa is perfect. Its one of the strongest weapons in the game - yes - but thats because its supposed to be. its a friggin shotgun. Its limited range and relatively small magazine makes me still use the other weapons. Now it just feels unsatisfying and lame.<br>
I also dislike that you now get the shotgun before the surface battle in WGH. i always thought it was so awesome that you see the shotgun at the beginning of the level and ask yourself “hm how the hell am I going to get this?” and then, after barely escaping marines and helicopters and shit you get into that office and get the shotgun you almost forgot about and finally get to use that (once) awesome gun.</p>
<p>-The scientist before the resonance cascade. Yeah hes the Stanley Parable narrator and thats pretty awesome but I just think the old voice fitted a LOT better. (I know this is nitpicking but it just breaks the immersion for me) I would prefer him as a multiplayer announcer or as one of the scientists of the Lambda team right before the teleporter (iirc there is one scientist sitting away from the others. he could have some interesting dialogue). Rather some optional easteregg instead of  “Hey look its the stanley parable guy!!!” (I know its not meant like this but it feels like this)</p>
<p>-The new glock. Although I think the new alt fire mechanic is interesting, it simply makes the gun a lot less useful in my opinion. After getting the mp5 I mainly used the glock to kill barnacles, headcrabs and clear mines and tripmines. In other words: do shit thats not worth the ammo of other guns. All this now takes significantly longer because the glock has such a huge delay (yes it is huge when you try to kill 10 barnacles. it used to take ~2 seconds to kill a barnacle, now its ~6). I could use the alt fire but thats not as accurate and wastes ammo. Then I could simply use the MP5 to clear all of this, it wouldnt make a difference</p>
<p>-I also hope for the VOX-Lines in OC and LC to return, I still dont know if theyre supposed to be absent, but they just make the world of the game seem more rich and detailed.</p>
<p>but remember, these are just a few things I disliked apart from the hundreds of things i liked. keep up the good work</p>
<p>[Edit:] One last thing I think was offputting is the desktop icon. We used to have this nice highres HL2-Style icon, now we have a strange lowres, pixely icon that looks very bad on white backgrounds <a href="https://puu.sh/i0rbN/4cda57567d.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://puu.sh/i0rbN/4cda57567d.png</a></p>
