    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fast-remote-access-program/6688</link>
    <description>I there a remote pc access program free or otherwise fast enough that you can game reasonably through it? Like could I be on a school computer and use this program to play a game running on my computer or are the programs/internet just not fast enough to handle that? And possibly a program that works on mac and pc.</description>

<p>There will always be a delay in the controls of cloud gaming until common internet speed is increased significantly and computer hardware gets powerful enough to encode/capture video instantly. As of now, none of the two are happening. Give it 5-7 years and maybe cloud gaming will be something big, but right now it’s kind of a joke.</p>

<p>I noticed on the previous page that sersoft said OnLive was a scam, or at least he thought so. It isn’t. And the reason OnLive is much more capable then any streaming programs is because they use servers for everything. First, they have dedicated gaming PC’s that play the actual games. Then they stream that video footage using (HD) capture hardware to a nearby server which is streaming/compressing the video on the fly over their insanely fast business internet package. It’s a bit more complicated then streaming/capturing all on your home pc, which probably only has 2-4 cores that are doing all the gaming/capturing/uploading by itself.</p>
<p>As for your current situation, you’ve already eliminated all possible options. Streaming movies, however, can be done using media-sharing software. But gaming isn’t done this way.</p>

            <p>Reviving this thread for a new related question.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to use my computer from my living room connected to my tv without having to move my computer every time. So I was wondering what is the best way to control your computer from a different room on a different screen? Is there an effective way to use a crappy computer attached to the tv and a remote access program? Or perhaps a program similar to remote access that is specifically designed for this purpose?</p>

            <p>I remember when I introduced counter strike standalone 1.6 to my school, soon everyone who had a flash drive and attended computer classes only played CS or starcraft, and soon after even those who weren’t supposed to attend computer class were there (absent from their actual class) and the replacement teacher was playing CS with the students because the real teacher had a nervous breakdown due to everyone playing CS in class.</p>
<p>Someone else got the blame for it but then I got busted for stealing a laptop from the mentally challenged class because someone was a snitch, later his house got robbed.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>The program can only be as fast as your internet connection (your schools AND your PCs). Not to forget all the work setting up a secure way of remotely connecting to your home PC.</p>
<p>How about you just do some work at school and play when you get home?</p>

<p>Ouch. I get 2.5 megabits upload speed. Unfortunately, at my school, which is where I planned to be using this, the internet is way to slow to stream the game at at all bearable settings.</p>

<p>you’re welcome then</p>
<p>and the lag depends on your PC, I play crysis 2 on my EEE PC with streammygame, I think paid version allows for bigger resolutions, but you need a gigabit router and wired connection to minimize the lag</p>

<p>Thanks.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And I’ve been running it over broadband because my home network is a little on the complicated side. L4D1 is completely playable. I get almost no lag. Strangely enough, I tried playing microsoft’s chess game and it lagged a little. Fallout New Vegas’s lag was unbearble.</p>

            <p>you’re welcome then</p>
<p>and the lag depends on your PC, I play crysis 2 on my EEE PC with streammygame, I think paid version allows for bigger resolutions, but you need a gigabit router and wired connection to minimize the lag</p>

            <p>Bump: Fuck Yeah! I got streammygame working and it works pretty well. Unfortunately the resolution is shit and if I try to play more advance games than L4D it start lagging, but it’s still pretty badass.</p>

<p>I just tried it for free. Works splendidly. I’d consider buying it but the games library is pitiful. Now I’m really curious, if they can do it, why can’t some remote access program do it? I’m going to fiddle around with streammygame as it looks like what I’m looking for.</p>

<p>Looks really interesting. How do the people at onlive get rid of the system lag?</p>
