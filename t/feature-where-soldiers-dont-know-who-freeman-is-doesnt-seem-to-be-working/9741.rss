    <title>Feature where soldiers don&#39;t know who Freeman is doesn&#39;t seem to be working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/feature-where-soldiers-dont-know-who-freeman-is-doesnt-seem-to-be-working/9741</link>
    <description>In We&#39;ve Got Hostiles, the very first encounter with a group of soldiers, someone shouted &quot;I&#39;m tired of these games Freeman, come on out!&quot; And I heard it again a little while later in a different fight. But the soldiers are supposed to have tag that causes them to not uses phrases that mention Freeman until later in the game.

So far I think that&#39;s the only phrase I&#39;ve heard, so maybe the &quot;I&#39;m tired of these games Freeman!&quot; bit has been put into the wrong category of phrases.</description>

            <p>Except that someone asked whether the soldiers would shout Freeman’s name in the early chapters and the devs gave us a screenshot of the various options for each soldier and one of them was an option for not knowing Freeman’s name. So the devs intended that the soldiers would not know who Freeman was straight away, but it seems that has feature hasn’t worked.</p>

            <p>I thought it was pretty intimidating that they already knew who I was. It really amplified the severity of the entire ordeal. The incident has been officially put at your fault, to such an extent that the military is there within 2 hours with the prime objective of killing your ass off</p>

            <p>I also confirm. It was kinda odd to hear, too, considered that i had seen that image from Ram a while ago.</p>

            <p>Me too. I was a bit surprised the grunts were using the “f word” so quickly. Maybe they had already watched “Freeman’s Mind…”</p>

            <p>My first encounter with the Freeman dialogue was in Power Up. I don’t know if that is too early or not, but it is quite early in the game (relatively), so I think it might be this bug</p>

            <p>I’ve run into this problem, too. On my first encounter with the HECU soldiers, every other line was something mentioning Freeman by name. I thought it was odd, given that they shouldn’t know his name until much later.</p>
