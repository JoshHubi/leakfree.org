    <description>Hey, it&#39;s been a good long 10 years since I&#39;ve been into computers and gaming on a remotely serious level, so I&#39;m looking for some advice, help, tips, etc.

I recently bought a new desktop computer, after suffering through the laptop fad these past 5 or 6 years.  It plays Source games (the HL series) on it&#39;s highest settings without skipping a beat.  And I&#39;m looking into other single player games.  Playing demos, and Crysis showed me that my system ain&#39;t what it oughta be, because there is some major skippy-ness, and poor quality in every game I try.  For example, Crysis had to be run on it&#39;s lowest setting in order to be remotely palatable.
So here are my specs, and maybe y&#39;all&#39;s can tell me what needs upgrading to make things go smooth.  Let me know if I&#39;ve left any details out.

Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit
AMD Phenom(TM) X4 820 quad-core processor [2.8GHz, 2MB L2 + 4MB L3 shared, up to 4000MT/s]
6GB DDR3-1066MHz SDRAM [3 DIMMs]
640GB 7200 rpm SATA 3Gb/s hard drive
1GB ATI Radeon HD 5450 [DVI, HDMI, VGA adapter]

Thanks.</description>

            <p>Anyway, answering the OP, your system is alright, just buy a new graphics card, because that model is mid to low range.</p>
<p>The Radeon 5770 should be alright.</p>
<p>edit: if budget is not an issue, buy a faster CPU too. The Phenom II X4 965 (3.4 Ghz quad-core) is great and is not very expensive.</p>
