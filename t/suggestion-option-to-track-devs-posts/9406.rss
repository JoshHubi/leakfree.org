    <title>Suggestion: Option to track Devs posts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestion-option-to-track-devs-posts/9406</link>
    <description>Alright, this isnt a suggestion for the Game per se, but it is a suggestion for the forums. I tried searching if someone else tried suggesting this, but no luck.

All the time when I read threads such as:
Ask the devs
Suggestion threads
News threads

I always seem to find myself scrolling through much of the discussion only in order to find IF a dev wrote something worth reading. Either about the mod, progress or other important updates in the community.

So my suggestion is basically to create some sort of page or way to track the devs posts in the forums. I do not know how much programming or work this feature would take to add, but in my opinion it would be a very nice feature to easily get access to the latest information.

We all know how much confusement there are when other people say &quot;ram said that and catz said that&quot;. If everyone can track these posts maybe it could also save some confusion around the forums, what do I know. All I know is I would like it. Would anyone else here?

Cheers!

            <p>I approve, this is an excellent idea. There might be a teensy problem if one of the Dev’s doesn’t quote the person he’s replying to though.</p>
<p>I also wonder if the “Secret Developer SubForum” might impact this feature.</p>
