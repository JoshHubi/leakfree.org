Don&#39;t think it requires a screenshot tbh, it&#39;s where you go into the water tunnels, turn the valve, float up and climb out of a second shaft. There&#39;s something wrong with the ladder and I couldn&#39;t climb out. Restarted the game and it was OK, but only managed it after a couple of minutes trying.

There was a barrel in the shaft the first time and not the second, which could be a coincidence, or not.</description>
