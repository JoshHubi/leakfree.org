    <description>This looks extremely interesting.

This WYSIWYG editor allows the user to create, compile and implement new shaders easily into a source mod without any preliminary knowledge of HLSL.

The shaders are based on nodes which are connected over bridges to finally compose a flowgraph for each, the vertex and pixel shader (similar to shader/material editors that you may know from other engines). Any shaders created this way can be referenced by a vmt file in a similar manner to shaders that have been created through code.  

Note: Shaders created through the editor will not work properly in Hammer or HLMV due to their non-hardcoded nature.

            <p>Intriguing.</p>
<p>In other news, the devs shader work is probably already amazing, but if it isn’t I’ll cry if they don’t use this.</p>
