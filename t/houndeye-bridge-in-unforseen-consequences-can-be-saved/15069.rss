    <title>&quot;Houndeye Bridge&quot; in Unforseen Consequences can be saved</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/houndeye-bridge-in-unforseen-consequences-can-be-saved/15069</link>
    <description>As the title says, the bridge (after the [i]Akria[/i]-Elevator) that is supposed to collapse after the houndeye sets of his shockwave apparently can be saved.
I specifically tried to do this, so I rushed towards the bridge and tried to shoot the Houndeye right away. I hit it, but it still managed to set of a shockwave, which did kill the guard, but did not blow up the TNT crates, oddly. So I killed the houndeye with the Glock and the bridge was still intact. But I couldn&#39;t cross it, there was an invisible wall half-way on the bridge. So I climbed the pipes and jumped right down to the bridge which triggered the transition. After the loading screen, I turned around and THEN the bridge started to collapse, but the crates and the forklift just stood there in mid-air. I shot the crates and when they exploded the forklift fell down, too (iirc). I attached some screens. If need be I&#39;ll attach the getpos and status. I only tried this once, so far.

            <p>This is interesting.</p>
<p>At first i thought that the Devs wanted to make it possible for one to stop the Houndeye,<br>
so you can cross the bridge, but an invisible wall?</p>
<p>That’s weird.</p>
<p>Because i remember posting, what i thought was a bug,<br>
a bug at he big rusty pistons room. Where you could stack crates and barrels to<br>
get on the catwalk without using the pistons.</p>
<p>i figured it’s a bug, since you can easily pass the room.<br>
At least they could have placed a crate on the pistons that would be vital to save before it gets destroyd<br>
in order to climb up the catwalk.</p>
