Sorry if this has been posted somewhere already.  I would love to hear everybody&#39;s two cents on this.

[b]EDIT:  [/b]Sorry the title got cut off.  It&#39;s supposed to say &quot;Great Cleansing&quot; if you haven&#39;t read the article&#39;s title yet.

[b]EDIT 2:[/b]  Gabe put out a quick press release.  Nothing specific was given except for the fact it won&#39;t affect any projects:


&quot;[i]We don&#39;t usually talk about personnel matters for a number of reasons. There seems to be an unusual amount of speculation about some recent changes here, so I thought I&#39;d take the unusual step of addressing them. No, we aren&#39;t canceling any projects. No, we aren&#39;t changing any priorities or projects we&#39;ve been discussing. No, this isn&#39;t about Steam or Linux or hardware or [insert game name here]. We&#39;re not going to discuss why anyone in particular is or isn&#39;t working here.[/i]&quot;</description>

            <p>Yeah correct, sometimes clearing the stock is the only major goal here but on the cases of one who really needs it can benefit from it, otherwise it’s good to refrain ourselves from it and optimize our finances to another next level.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  <a href="https://www.c2vancouver.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Reading Tutor</a></p>

<p>Exactly.  The thing that’s getting everyone worried is the shear number of people that left.  It’s clearly not a financial issue.  They could survive off of Steam alone.  Most likely just them clearing out old stock.</p>
