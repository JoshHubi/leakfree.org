    <title>HL2 in Real Life (and Italian Voiceovers)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-in-real-life-and-italian-voiceovers/841</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

not sure if someone posted this already, I just discovered it by chance ..

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovtEeLV340g&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovtEeLV340g[/url]

It&#39;s a 10-minute short movie about Half-Life 2. personally, I think it&#39;s quite an achievement and a work of love, given the limited resources.

Also, it allows me to showcase the Italian Voice of the HEV Suit which I have been scouring the Internet for ...  :wink:  I suppose that now what I spoke about in the other thread about HEV Suit voiceover might make more sense.

Enjoy,

M.</description>

            <p>Considering they’re not a professional team of actors hired to make blockbuster movies, its a pretty decent effort. Escape from City 17 didn’t have any first person views, which is probably infinitely harder to pull off well than other types of shots.</p>

            <p>I liked the way they made the shot look like it was from the game, as well as how they held the weapons, etc. although I agree that things happened rather too slowly and they could have done better on the effects.</p>

<p>That’s not the point. I agree with Ibanez. They didn’t have to show zombies or headcrabs which, aside from the Synths, are the most difficult things to get right and can so easily look terrible. As a result of their retarded plush headcrabs, I got the feeling that it was a comedy. Half-Life 2 is one of those things where you either spend the money on making it look right or you don’t do it at all. It’s nigh impossible to do a film on the game on a shoestring budget.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who didn’t like it?  The only thing they had going for them was that they lived somewhere that HL2 was based off of.  They used plushies thrown at the camera for headcrabs, guys running around with plushies on their heads for zombies (wearing clean skater shoes no less), and everything was really slow and awkward. Escape from city 17 was miles better.</p>
