            <p>I’ve tried GIMP and just couldn’t get used to the interface. I’m really used to Adobe thanks to them teaching me everything in school on how to use it then not mentioning it cost 200 dollars to get it at home (bastards)</p>

            <p>The best you’re likely to get is the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). It’s not as powerful as Photoshop and IMO the interface is horrible, but it’s the best free alternative I can think of.</p>
