    <title>Which chapters of any HL game do you NOT like?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/which-chapters-of-any-hl-game-do-you-not-like/9349</link>
    <description>Since we have a thread for chapters we like, I figured I&#39;d be the other side of the coin and rant about stuff that pisses me off about the game. 

This is probably where you expect me to talk about Xen being a complete mess. It is, but the game goes downhill earlier than that. I think the decay starts with Lambda Core. 

My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:

1. The beginning of Lambda Core has you coming in from a rather large fight against Xen Agrunts and HECU soldiers. I walked onto the Lambda Core elevator with around 39 health on Hard difficulty, and there is little to sustain the player at first- the closest heal is the scientist who drew the short straw to open the door for you. What&#39;s between you and him? Black Ops Assassin units and the odd Xen alien. The former are pitted against the player inside an area stacked to claustrophobic effect with crates. Getting to the second floor means the player must break some boxes to clear a path to a stairway up. While the player is doing this, the assassins will run about harassing the player as they try to get their bearings. The Assassins in HL also don&#39;t have the red eye-glow effect like the Black Ops in Black Mesa do, so they&#39;re that much harder to track down and kill. I tend to burn through a lot of grenades and shotgun shells in this area.

2. The Lambda Core level flow plays out a lot like Blast Pit. To enable the teleporter to Xen, the player must reactivate the pump controls and flood the core manually. This boils down to two large level &quot;bounces,&quot; both of which are positively [i]riddled[/i] with Agrunts and Vorts. The verticality of the structure is frequently used against the player in some areas, where the grunts will open fire on the player from above. But their tactics aren&#39;t the problem so much as the [i]sheer amount[/i] of these foes. And they all seem to respawn as well! 

3. The flooding of the core sequence and the entire access to the next map make no logical sense. The flow controls for the water once both pumps are on are in the core itself, controlled by valves. Wouldn&#39;t they have some kind of control room where the functions of the core and the regulators for the water amount could be controlled? It makes no sense to put flow controls inside the core proper, because no one would rationally assign personnel to work controls underwater.

4. THE FUCKING PORTAL AREA. There is one area inside Lambda Core that never fails to piss me off, and that&#39;s the giant circular tower with the Xen portals everywhere. Players have no indication as to where any portal will lead, and a few of them are purpose built deathtraps, seemingly constructed specifically to encourage the player to save scum the fuck out of this poorly constructed pile of shit to get on with the game. 

And finally:

5. The &quot;defend the scientist&quot; sequence while the teleporter warms up is ridiculous. Controllers repeatedly spawn into the map and shoot at both the player and the scientist working the portal controls. The player is given a ludicrous amount of ammunition for this sequence, but there is very little in the way of cover from the repeated onslaught of orange cancer. There&#39;s the four portal arms, and that&#39;s about it in terms of cover. Hopefully this is fixed in BM.</description>

            <p>Half life, I really didn’t like Surface Tension that much.<br>
Opposing Force, the last level &amp; boss was real boring.<br>
Blue Shift, meh it was all pretty good.<br>
In Hl2 I really hate Water Hazard, and strongly dislike Highway 17. Don’t like the turret standoffs and the citadel that much either.<br>
I really hated going back to the Citadel in Ep1, especially if I just played Hl2.<br>
Episode 2, strider battle was meh.</p>

            <p>For HL1 I’d say On a Rail and the Xen chapters, because they were just kinda boring for me. I also find lambda core to be somewhat annoying, but I think that’s just cause I’m so close to the ending. Kind of like how some City 17 chapters annoyed me in HL2, because I grew weary of fighting and just wanted the ending.</p>

            <p>There were chapters I liked. I hated some before, but that was by my stupidity. Now, for HL1, Apprehension and Interloper are not cool.</p>
<p>For HL2, Water Hazard. Spent 130 hours there!</p>

            <p>For me, the most annoying parts have to be the female assassin parts (ANY of them) and the beggining of Lambda Core, also the first half of On A Rail can be boring as fuck if you stick too much on the train<br>
Half Life 2: the “stay off the sand” parts<br>
I really enjoyed Water Hazard and Route Kanal though</p>

            <p>Water Hazard wasnt that much fun, the parts where you have to fight helicopters etc is fine, but the rest of it is just plain transportation with low action.<br>
Also, it disturbs me that freeman seems to be stearing all vehicles with his mind rather than hands. I mean, how much trouble could there have been adding the arms in the vehicles?</p>
<p>In HL1 I’d really say the part after Gonarch Lair, what’s the name again?</p>

            <p>Hmmmm I guess I would have to say I didn’t much like Blast Pit. I didn’t hate it, but I couldn’t wait to get past it.<br>
It was a complete pain in the ass for me. I can’t really define why I didn’t much like it. The other would be power up. It served no purpose but to put a cushion between figuring out where you need to go and actually getting to it.<br>
I liked everything from HL2 and its episodes.</p>

            <p>I’ve never really liked Office Complex very much. It’s just a bland chapter that hasn’t aged very well, although back in 1998, it was a very good showcase for all the new gameplay ideas Valve had pioneered.</p>

            <p>For <span class="bbcode-b">Half Life 1</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">On a Rail</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">We’ve got Hostiles</span> are the most bland levels I can think of. <span class="bbcode-i">On a Rail</span> was fun, but annoying; <span class="bbcode-i">We’ve got Hostiles</span> was so visually monotonous that I want to gouge my eyes out whenever I’m on the Chapter. I really don’t like <span class="bbcode-i">Office Complex</span>, either. I mean, it starts off really well, but it get’s a bit annoying near the end. <span class="bbcode-i">Residue Processing</span> can be a bit confusing sometimes, but it was fun on the first go, so I guess as I get tired of the game, the fun factor drops and the confusion gets on my nerves a bit more.</p>
<p>All other chapters are amazing for the most part.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Half Life 2</span>: All the chapters were pretty damn amazing, but if I had to pick one I didn’t like as much as the rest, it would probably be <span class="bbcode-i">Water Hazard</span>; which is odd, because <span class="bbcode-i">Highway 17</span> is probably one of my favorite -if not my absolute favorite- chapters.</p>

            <p>When I played the game for first time I was 6 year old(My big brother had bought it, and I used to watch him play, and while he wasn’t using the computer I played too). I was so young I loved absolutely everything about it. But I had got stuck in the last part, when I had already killed Nihilanth, because nothing happened, he stayed there floating above my head. I had to destroy those fireballs to finish him, but I didn’t know. So I left the game thinking it was messed up.</p>
<p>When I played again much later, I imagined the game would continue after Xen, and that you would return to the Earth and escape from Black Mesa or something like that. But you didn’t. All those years I spent thinking of how would the game end, and I realised that there was just a suited strange guy talking to me in a spacial tram. So I have to say, I really hate the ending. I would have liked to see something more spectacular than that.</p>

            <p>The teleport maze was head-scratchingly confusing my first time through.</p>
<p>I think it could have benefited from perhaps having more colors and each set of portals share the same color, so that way you could actually tell where a portal would go (since you could look up and see the portal exits)</p>
<p>I really hope BM has changed this puzzle so that it’s still quite a challenge, but it also reward quick thinking as opposed to trial and error.</p>

            <p>Ideally, a player should never feel like they’re trial-and-erroring their way through a level, killing themselves multiple times in the process.  The mines segment is acceptable since it’s possible to minesweep with explosives and snarks, but the Lambda Core teleport maze has no such excuse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we have a thread for chapters we like, I figured I’d be the other side of the coin and rant about stuff that pisses me off about the game.</p>
<p>This is probably where you expect me to talk about Xen being a complete mess. It is, but the game goes downhill earlier than that. I think the decay starts with Lambda Core.</p>
<p>My reasoning for this conclusion is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The beginning of Lambda Core has you coming in from a rather large fight against Xen Agrunts and HECU soldiers. I walked onto the Lambda Core elevator with around 39 health on Hard difficulty, and there is little to sustain the player at first- the closest heal is the scientist who drew the short straw to open the door for you. What’s between you and him? Black Ops Assassin units and the odd Xen alien. The former are pitted against the player inside an area stacked to claustrophobic effect with crates. Getting to the second floor means the player must break some boxes to clear a path to a stairway up. While the player is doing this, the assassins will run about harassing the player as they try to get their bearings. The Assassins in HL also don’t have the red eye-glow effect like the Black Ops in Black Mesa do, so they’re that much harder to track down and kill. I tend to burn through a lot of grenades and shotgun shells in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lambda Core level flow plays out a lot like Blast Pit. To enable the teleporter to Xen, the player must reactivate the pump controls and flood the core manually. This boils down to two large level “bounces,” both of which are positively <span class="bbcode-i">riddled</span> with Agrunts and Vorts. The verticality of the structure is frequently used against the player in some areas, where the grunts will open fire on the player from above. But their tactics aren’t the problem so much as the <span class="bbcode-i">sheer amount</span> of these foes. And they all seem to respawn as well!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flooding of the core sequence and the entire access to the next map make no logical sense. The flow controls for the water once both pumps are on are in the core itself, controlled by valves. Wouldn’t they have some kind of control room where the functions of the core and the regulators for the water amount could be controlled? It makes no sense to put flow controls inside the core proper, because no one would rationally assign personnel to work controls underwater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE FUCKING PORTAL AREA. There is one area inside Lambda Core that never fails to piss me off, and that’s the giant circular tower with the Xen portals everywhere. Players have no indication as to where any portal will lead, and a few of them are purpose built deathtraps, seemingly constructed specifically to encourage the player to save scum the fuck out of this poorly constructed pile of shit to get on with the game.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And finally:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The “defend the scientist” sequence while the teleporter warms up is ridiculous. Controllers repeatedly spawn into the map and shoot at both the player and the scientist working the portal controls. The player is given a ludicrous amount of ammunition for this sequence, but there is very little in the way of cover from the repeated onslaught of orange cancer. There’s the four portal arms, and that’s about it in terms of cover. Hopefully this is fixed in BM.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I respect your opinion, and I’m not going to call you an asshole for it. But I think differently. I like every chapter, especially the difficult ones, since they challenge me, and the more annoyed I get by death, the larger is the victory feeling when I manage to do it right.</p>
