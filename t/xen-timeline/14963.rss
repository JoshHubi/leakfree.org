    <title>Xen Timeline</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-timeline/14963</link>
    <description>[b]Happy Halloween![/b]
We wanted to use the holiday and the sale to announce our rough timeline for Xen. We are currently targeting a summer 2017 release. We will keep you up to date on our progress and we plan to show off some media as we finish developing Xen to give everyone a glimpse at what we are working on.

[b]Why so Long?[/b]
We can’t overemphasize how much work it was to get the game on Steam. Most of our effort before launching was put into porting to the retail engine and getting the game to work better than it did in the mod. Since release, the team has been focused on developing Xen. We even planned our updates to have features that would help improve the earthbound levels and Xen (for example CSM).

We want to do Xen the justice it deserves, and have it be the definitive climax to the Half-Life 1 story. To do this we have completely redesigned and expanded the Xen levels to what we think Valve would have done without the limitations of the time.

To help illustrate this, here are some comparison shots of our levels to the original Half-Life levels in Hammer. Not only are our maps substantially bigger than the originals, there are more of them as well.

As always we want to thank our awesome community for supporting us in Early Access and for being as passionate as us about Half-Life. We have been working really hard on Xen and we hope you are as excited as us to see the full release of Black Mesa. We’ll have more in game media to show off in the near future!

[b]Patch[/b]
We also wanted to quickly mention that we have a patch coming for our latest update. This patch fixes:

* The hitching on Linux multiplayer servers and on Linux single player
* Russian closed captions
* UI fonts being broken for people that do not have Steam set to English
* Workshop publish tool not launching
* ZECU torso crashing hammer and the game


Thanks!

            <p>Okay, so what do you guys think of the two new screenshots the devs released?<br>
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/aZk2uyc.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">First screenshot</a> and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/33ZZVler.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">second screenshot</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I absolutely love the lighting and colors. You can really tell why they were pushing for godrays.<br>
The old Xen looked very bland with its fleshy monochrome colors, Black Mesa Xen looks a lot more colorful and alien to me.<br>
I love the contrast between the light blue sky and the orange Xen crystals that’s going on. And the Xen fauna looks great as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, this please. This is something that Valve has pushed extensively in CS:GO as well, even adding a $notint parameter to VMTs that tells the game what parts of a model NOT to tint (given the model consists of multiple materials), as shown in <a href="https://media.steampowered.com/apps/csgo/blog/images/workshop/lighting/13.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this example</a>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would love to see a L4D/Alien Swarm-style colour parameter on props - I could see myself getting a lot of use out of that with custom assets, and a lot of the vehicle models added in the STU update are L4D2 models built with that feature in mind. There could potentially be some use in applying that tech to xenian landscapes as well, to boost variation in the organic and rock props without creating whole new skins.</p>
<p>That said, even the new models they’ve already shown off in that one screenshot would make me a happy camper (mapper?) so I’m not going to hold it against them if they don’t implement that parameter.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just happened across the Content Creator Request thread, and it seems I already stated my desire to see it <span class="bbcode-i">and</span> got a confirmation that it was in the works at the time. It was supposed to come out in Content Update 3, but as is often the case for programming tasks, it must have gotten pushed back due to bugs. That or they forgot to put it in the fgd. Either way, hopeful it will be fixed by Xen’s release.</p>

            <p>I for one have gotten less and less interested in the actual design of Xen as I’ve become more and <span class="bbcode-i">more</span> interested in what sort of engine improvements we might be seeing along with it. The <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28869-Texture-Lights-and-Bounce-lighting-in-VRAD/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">new RAD compile parameters discussed way back when</a> are neat, but they’ve also piqued my curiosity about what else may be to come.</p>

<p>Isn’t it obvious. They have taken all the ea money and split it 50 ways. Each developer has bought their own Caribbean Island and stocked it with exotic wildlife. That is the only reasonable answer, either that or they are busy at work on releasing new media because if they are just squashing bugs and finishing the game I am going to be sorely excited.</p>

<p>IIRC there wasn’t actually a transition back to the BMRF once you arrived in Xen. It’s been ages I played it, so I could be wrong, but I watched a playthrough of one of the original Xen that has been ported to BM as an workshop addition, and there weren’t any transtions back. Not saying it would be cool, tho.</p>
<p>In Blue Shift and OppFor however there were several transtions back to the Facility, I think.</p>

            <p>Great, now this thread is starting to derail.<br>
Hope everyone is happy with their unnecessary comments<br>
that do not belong here in the first place.</p>
<p>So i’ll ask something on topic so this comment doesn’t derail it further:</p>
<p>I remember in the first Half Life there was only one transition back to the BM<br>
in the Xen chapter. Could we expect more of these transitions?</p>

<p>JohnWorfin wanted news about Xen because it’s summer “according to the outside of his house”, despite it not technically actually being summer.<br>
By that logic, Crypt, who lives in Texas, should be entitled to Xen news because the consistent weather in Texas is comparable to a temperate climate’s definition of summer.</p>
<p>That came off as slightly condescending, but I just have fun explain stuff in detail.</p>
