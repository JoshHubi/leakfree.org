    <description>I know its old news, but is anyone else ticked off that the PC version of Assassin&#39;s Creed Brotherhood is delayed till February when the console versions are coming out in less than a month? This is the game I&#39;ve been looking forward to for the better part of 2 years.</description>

            <p>When I saw the title I thought that it was delayed everywhere, and I got really annoyed. Then I read the post.You should probably get someone to change the title to Asassin’s Creed Brotherhood PC delayed, or PC Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood delayed.</p>

            <p>It strikes me as one of those games one would rather sit down and enjoy on a console rather than a game one would hunch over a keyboard for.</p>
<p>It’s just hooded guys with tiny knives. You can probably wait.</p>

            <p>I pre-ordered Limited for 360. I’m not too worried about the PC release since it will undoubtedly have the crappy DRM which AC2 is infamous for.</p>
