    <title>Crashing 1 minute after launch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-1-minute-after-launch/11211</link>
    <description>Hi, I encountered a weird and very annoying issue. Been playing Black Mesa just fine last night and before, up until Chapter 5 &quot;We&#39;ve got hostiles&quot;. No issues, no crashes, nothing. 
Then today, I start the game and the game crashes 1 minute after. No matter what I do, it always crashes after 1 minute. I can load an old save, start a new game, it ALWAYS crashes. I rebooted my system, no difference. 
What the hell is going on? It was fine yesterday.
This is extremely frustrating because I&#39;ve loved the game so far.</description>

            <p>I have the exact same problem.</p>
<p>Can you tell me which ini files you altered and how you did it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Okay, SOMEHOW the problem solved itself. All I did now was mess around abit with the settings. Changed resolution, played with some of the settings in the ini files. It might be a coincidence though. This weird error came out of nowhere and vanished into nowhere, which is just as weird…</p>
