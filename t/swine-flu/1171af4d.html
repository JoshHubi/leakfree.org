<p>I NEVER said they would release on the public etc. What I said is the Government would not miss an opportunity to weapon ANYTHING they feel would be a benefit to the Government. I did NOT say they DID this, but the possibility is  there since the recreated the virus. As to the Hoof and Mouth in England, there was a research lab in England where it got out and infected the local livestock (They believe from a labcoat). This is well documented now and was the basis of the 28 days later movies you refer to that I NEVER mentioned.</p>
<p>The same can happen to ANY dangerous vector, the possibility of someone being careless has and can happen again. I find as well as do some others I know that this swine Flu is very similar to the 1918 Flu, and how odd that the real 1918 Flu has be recreated since 2005. I am not saying the two are one, but that it could be possible, but I would not say for a fact it was. The 1918 Flu could kill you within 24 hours no matter how healthy you were. This was because of the response to the virus of your body attacking itself.</p>

<p>People the people I know said it wasnt anything to worry about and that the scares were done as tests to get the public ready for the real possibility of a killer Flu similar to the 1918 one. So know these people well enough (going to lunch and working with them) I reasoned that the media was hyping it. As you notice the media is NOT hyping this Flu, in fact there is little information being giving such as HEALTHY people being killed by this flu even though the numbers are still low.</p>

<p>I agree on Books, I WAS suggestion people sit down and do their research instead of asking people to HAND SPOON FEED them the information. I asked a question to the modders of the mod, and then decided to help warn some of the younger members of this forum, but I will be damn if I will SPOON FEED a lazy generation that wants everything given to them on a silver platter. To be honest I really dont care about those that wish not to head a warning I do CARE about those honestly wanting answers and solutions with out a smart ass tone or immature attacks.</p>

<p>There was NOTHING objective to your original response to my posts, you seem hell bent to deny any danger and to me that is very foolish, again the old saying better to be on the side of caution. There is no logical argument to have people refrain for modest preparations, even if this Flu isn’t the killer Flu one day there will be one, both CDC and WHO said its not a matter of “IF” but “WHEN”.</p>
<p>I guess by your reasoning that the CDC and WHO are just trying to cause panic when they suggest EVERYTHING I just said in my posts with regards to preparation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the 1918 Flu if you don’t think they have or are trying to weaponize your foolish, not saying this flu is that, but to think scientist wouldn’t want to SEE what they could do with it is naive.</p>
<p>As to the End of the world I never said that, I did say the Pandemic has the ability to be the worse yet. What’s the harm in preparing ahead of time? Especially MINOR common sense preparation?</p>
<p>No I wasn’t worried about SARS or AVIAN Flu at the time.</p>
<p>As to me not providing facts, please BUY a book about the 1918 Flu and how this Flu and that seem to be similar, hence what got me wondering on the reverse engineering, heck even if it was for Study it could still get out of the lab.</p>
<p>As to the people I spoke with could care less about you or this forum, they are only focused on their work. Personally most I spoke with think the world is overpopulated anyway, so I guess your responses would be in line with their thinking that some are incapable of surviving based on Darwin’s Theory.</p>
<p>Well I tried, I can safely say you all deserve what you get! Anyone stupid enough to say wait till you are warned on TV is insane. That’s like living in Earthquake areas and not having a 72 hour kit. I watch the Deer where I live and when they hear Danger (a click) they all RUN and Hide to survive, but then about 2-3 minutes later they forget and think the danger is gone, then they get Shot by the hunter. Same with some people……</p>
<p>I never heard of attacking someone who is genuine on trying to help, Fear mongering is saying we are all going to die and its going to happen for a fact tomorrow, etc. I never said any of those things. Just because I said something that Scares a lot of you, you decided to ATTACK me personally. Funny its like telling someone the Dam has some Cracks and it MAY break sometime soon, and instead of checking it out or preparing for the eventuality of it. The people yell and call names the person who warned them.</p>
<p>BTW I relayed this posting to some of the people I know, and I do hope they drop by to educate you guys, but the first thing they told me is “Let the Idiots die, they are meant to”. Also the Age group here seems to be 18 – 35 years.</p>
<p>I’m done here, not all but a lot of you here are just Punk Kids who think you know everything just like every generation, only to learn the hard way.</p>

<p>Tiki I don’t think they fully understand that the FIRST WAVE is always small its the second and third waves that are worse.</p>
<p>To the others, this Flu is KILLING HEALTHY PEOPLE not sickly and they are all in their 20-40’s, this is Important as the Flu normally effects Very young and elderly.</p>
<p>Also I remember back 2 years ago them finding a Body in the Antarctic WHICH HAD THE 1918 Swine flu and they wanted to reverse engineer it. It was in Scientific America I believe. I do wonder personally if they didn’t succeed in reengineering it and somehow it got out, similar to the hoof and mouth disease in England.</p>
<p>Here is a similar article I called up, I was wrong it was back in 2005 so more like 4 years ago but there is another one that spoke of reverse engineering it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/oct0505studies.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/oct0505studies.html</a></p>
<p>Also keep in Mind that there is a 24hour period where the person LOOKS FINE but is a carrier of the Virus so you can get infected at a rapid rate once it mutates.  Also when the outbreak DOES take place, all the stuff you would need, facemasks, gloves, and disinfectant will all be sold out or at prices unbelievable.</p>
<p>Seriously I am not saying to LIVE IN FEAR but to error on the side of caution and prepare NOW, it only costs very little to have the supplies mentioned above plus some extra water and food, as quarantine in these cases could last several days. To all those acting silly and making jokes, it’s NOT something to kid about or make light of. I’m not saying for sure this is the BIG one as they call it at WHO and the CDC, but this Flu has the BEST chance of being so out of ALL the viruses that we have seen yet!</p>
<p>Yes I would like to play the mod, but also I am now MORE concerned over the ignorance and lack of concern of this Flu, and I am concerned for the Members of this forum now. I was not expecting these kinds of responses on the Flu. PLEASE gather the few items you need NOW before the outbreak, Most of the Items have NO SHELF LIFE and can be saved if the outbreak doesn’t happen now but the unknown future. The food, its good to have extra that can be stored for ANY type of emergency, so nothing would be wasted.</p>
<p>The Flu may be nothing, then again it may NOT, is it really worth the risk to just save some money for a PS2 game? What happens when Billions KNOW it’s an outbreak when it happens? Are you going to the store then or buying what you need online then? Mail will shut down until a system for decontamination can be in place. Level 6 is important it means Governments can impose Martial Law, Shut Banks, Stores, Internet down and Force Mandatory Vaccines and if there isn’t enough you WILL be quarantined in your Home or a special facility. Nor is there any promise it will WORK, it’s a shot in the dark, not to mention 10% will have a severe response from the shots alone or the possibility it can mutate worse with those with the Shots. There are many possibilities and only a couple good ones.</p>
<p>Anyway I am just sharing what I was told in my conversations with those who DO know what they are talking about, and they are WORRIED.</p>

<p>The swine flu I mentioned is and Avian Flu, it has 3 Avian, 2 Swine and 1 Human mutations. Its VERY simular to the 1918 Flu and yes they are SERIOUSLY concerned about this one Mutating. I suggest checking this out more, its very serious. As for the game its just a game, but it would have been nice to play the damn thing. lol</p>
<p>Take it or leave it, I work with WHO and in doing so I get alot of information my way that isnt always released to the general public for fear of panic. Am I spooked, YES I am its serious and I have made preparations to have gloves and mask when needed as well as Medaphene Spray for my mail. All the Doctors I spoke with at WHO all suggested to do so as well as the vaccines, There will be 3 1 standard avian flu, then a booster, then the one for the swine flu, if there were not worried they wouldnt bother trying to produce enough for ALL the populations in the 1st world countries.</p>
<p>I suggest checking this out more than Fox news, there is more information still out there, even if you dont work with CDC or WHO.</p>
<p>Anyway it would have been nice to play the mod before possible problems, and all I suggested is how it would effect release. I am surprised of the ignorance of what this Avian Flu that is out there and what it could mean this Fall. But then again I blame TV and the news, too many think the Vaccine is a cure all and thats it, Whats worrying them by who I spoke with is not the amount who have died but those who have died and how they died. It will mutate its just to what level.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Word of advice, its better to over worry about the dam busting that not. Too many people have lost their lives by not heading warnings and to error on the side of caution.</p>

<p>I see no one takes serious the possibilty of a real pandemic. I suggest some of the posters to look more into WHY the Flu is special. this isnt conspiracy theory you can check CDC and tons of medical sites to see their concerns, also there is NO promises that the vaccine will protect you.</p>
<p>As for the early swine Flu, true many got over it, but the problem is the second wave which in 1918 happened the same way, summer version was soft not many deaths, but the fall/winter is what kicked off the deaths.</p>
<p>It was a serious question, its a shame “IF” this Flu is as serious as they say it could be that the mod would be lost because of timing the release. There IS a possibility that the Flu could be equal to the SPANISH FLU of the 1918 is fatalities. If some of you havent noticed the Governments are really trying to get as many vaccines as they can for this Flu and are taking it VERY serious. We are STILL in a LEVEL 6 Pandemic, I am sure most dont know that, and this is why World Health Organization is mobilizing the Nations for Massive Vaccine program.</p>
<p>I fear alot here do not understand how serious this really is. This has NOTHING to do with aliens or conspiracy, the CDC and WHO are both trying to warn people of the REAL danger that could happen this year.</p>
<p>I am sorry some of you feel this is a Joke, its not and I hope it doesnt mutate as it can to cause massive deaths worldwide. BUt there is more than a 60% chance that this Flu will mutate to a more deadly strain than the minor one this summer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new, but I have monitored off and on this site for about 4 years or so, whenever the mod began.</p>
<p>My point in the thread was with a possible Swine Flu Panademic being VERY possible this fall/winter, will we ever get to play this mod?</p>
<p>My worry is that there is so many people involved in so many countries that with all the chaos because of the issues with a massive pandemic will we ever get to play this great Mod because of member deaths?</p>
<p>I fear this mod will be released around christmas, but I also fear it will be too late. I mean Massive 1918 style Flu will put a damper on the mod being released if not from the modders for sure from the sites that host.</p>
<p>Just curious others opinions including those working on the mod. I am not asking like others for the mods release just to play etc. I am just stating a very Logical point on the mod ever being released. This Swine Flu if it catches on is NOT the common cold and will have massive effects on the economy, mail, businesses, and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Anyway, The video of the Mod looks great, I just hope we will be able to play it.</p>

          <p>Hell, for all I know we could all be dead by tomorrow. Earth might be hit by gamma rays from an exploding star less that 1000 lightyears away, and we would all be toast. An energy flare from our very own sun could spontaneously erupt and hit our planet, setting the whole atmosphere and surface on fire. Not to mention the thousands of asteroids in our solar system that might perchance some day collide with our homeworld.</p>
<p>And that’s only cosmic events counting. What about World War III breaking out? The scenario from the game Fallout does become more and more plausible with each passing day. What did the Fallout 2 intro say? “Too many humans, not enough space or resources to go around”. It’s already happening. All the richer nations of the world are preparing for the event of a nuclear war. Giant bunkers and vaults beneath the surface are being built right now. Billions of dollars, euros and other currencies are being spent on those projects, so someone seems to take them deadly serious. During our lifetime, wars for the remaining resources on Earth will spread around the globe. And most of those wars will be fought by nations who have a nuclear weapon arsenal available, should everything else fail. Most of our energy still comes from oil and uranium. The deposits will likely be depleted in a couple of decades.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of death we will die. But dying from old age seems to move further and further down the list of possibilities with each passing day.</p>
<p>But there is no point in spreading panic about it. Fearing death doesn’t do any good. Life is just a ride in a rollercoaster. Enjoy it while it lasts! Don’t bother that it will end too soon! Every life ends “too soon” - at least for those left behind to mourn for the deceased. Just realise that this is what your life is destined to do: end! And there is nothing you can do about it. If some motherfucker wants to kill you (for some reason only he understands), you will die violently. There is nothing you can do about it. There is no such thing as “safety”. If a new disease spreads too quickly, you might die from it. The same thing could have happened every time in your life that you were sick. There is no such thing as a “harmless” sickness. Every illness can become severe and deadly very quickly, if the circumstances are grave enough.</p>
<p>The only difference you can make is: enjoy your life and ignore that it might end any time. Look forward to cool things your future might bring, even if it’s a matter of pure random luck when you finally get to experience them.<br>
Preparing for the apocalypse will only serve to make your suffering last a little longer. Life is destined to end. Death is the ultimate goal of living. Right after reproduction, of course.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
