    <description>Hi,

I am new, but I have monitored off and on this site for about 4 years or so, whenever the mod began.

My point in the thread was with a possible Swine Flu Panademic being VERY possible this fall/winter, will we ever get to play this mod? 

My worry is that there is so many people involved in so many countries that with all the chaos because of the issues with a massive pandemic will we ever get to play this great Mod because of member deaths?


I fear this mod will be released around christmas, but I also fear it will be too late. I mean Massive 1918 style Flu will put a damper on the mod being released if not from the modders for sure from the sites that host.

Just curious others opinions including those working on the mod. I am not asking like others for the mods release just to play etc. I am just stating a very Logical point on the mod ever being released. This Swine Flu if it catches on is NOT the common cold and will have massive effects on the economy, mail, businesses, and society as a whole.

Anyway, The video of the Mod looks great, I just hope we will be able to play it.

<p>blah blah…Its serious as H1N1 is serious and there are deaths of people Bleeding out of their Eyes and Mouths with this Virus, Some died within 24hours, and yet nothing in the news…</p>

<p>Haha, what the fuck. There’s nothing in the news about people bleeding to death via their eyes because it’s ludicrous fiction.</p>
<p>Several people I know have caught and very quickly recovered from sine flu, <span class="bbcode-i">including my six year old niece</span> and a significant portion of the rest of her school. At this point your nonsense and fear-mongering have crossed the line into blatant trolling intentional or otherwise (bleeding out of their eyes, for Christ’s sake, I mean <span class="bbcode-i">really</span>, since when is that a symptom of any flu, including the Spanish one? Have you any idea how long it would take you to bleed life-threatening pints of blood out of your facial orifices?), so as much fun as everyone is having at your expense in this thread I’m going to close it now.

            <p>I read you talk about FEMA preparing for massive body disposal… if it’s the story I think it is, that was debunked… People just take a screenshot on google maps of something that looks like a field of coffins, and start a conspiracy theory about it…</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh, and what the fuck do YOU know about that? You analyzed it? Or you took this from <a href="http://omgwereallgonnadie.com" rel="nofollow noopener">omgwereallgonnadie.com</a>? You can say ‘some people said it is […]’, but you speak as if you formed your own opinions by analyzing it.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t compare to 1918… hygiene was much different back then, medecine was far less developed, authorities had absolutely no plan to take care of potentially critical or critical situations. Even if the virus was as bad as 1918, the effects would be far less.</p>

            <p>To the guy who said its avian flu it tracking and not swine flu, the Swine Flu “IS” Avian Flu, it just has more mutations in it.</p>
<p>The site with the tracker is ONLY tracking the new flu since it broke out earlier this year. The Swine Flu is a Version of H1N1 therefore the same terms are used.</p>
<p>Its serious as H1N1 is serious and there are deaths of people Bleeding out of their Eyes and Mouths with this Virus, Some died within 24hours, and yet nothing in the news. If anything the news isn’t HYPING they are suppressing for fear of panic.</p>
<p>All I am saying as you have been warned that this strain will get worse as it mutates, there are too many experts that agree this is a serious strain. If some of you would buy a book on the history of the Spanish Flu you would know the First wave of the outbreak was so light no one thought anything of it. It was the second and third waves that started to kill.</p>
<p>FEMA has been preparing for Massive unrest and body disposal for a few years now, just because of the H1N1 and the possibility of when it will mutate.</p>
<p>As for whether this one was made, it looks very complicated and seems to genetically similar to the 1918 Flu, so I THINK that could be possible. It wouldn’t be too hard for it to get out by someone being careless while reverse studying it. It could have been a weakened form that got out, but it will grow and get stronger as it mutates.</p>
<p>There are ALOT of people on Talk shows saying this Flu is nothing etc, There wrong there is something different about this Flu and the People at WHO and CDC are really really worried about this one, when they weren’t on the others. I am not speaking of behind the scenes and not the warnings to the public. Some of the people I know say this could be the one they are waiting on and they plan to get out of dodge before the panic starts.</p>
<p>If you WAIT last minute it will be too late, you wont be able to buy the food and supplies you may need once it’s on CNN. You also don’t want to be a food line to get your food as people in the Line could be infected. There is a 24-hour period when the person is HIGHLY contagious and yet looks fine!</p>
<p>All the Silly childish pictures will not change the facts, I’m sorry but some of your here are in you middle 20’s and should act like men not children, there were men in their 20’s winning a war and surviving the great depression and now we have them throwing things at people who warn them with real concern. I’m sorry but its sick to attack someone trying to help you.</p>
<p>Firefly101</p>
<p>Really to those of you who are taking this thread serious and doing you research I wish you well, your doing the right thing looking this up, as you do you will find out why you should make a few modest preparations. AND THIS why I BOTHER to reply in this thread still as a few of you seem to be open minded and mature to look into this without making childish remarks and pictures.</p>

            <p>The BBC is a perfectly valid source, sorry. Even more so because it is publicly funded.</p>
<p>This guy Firefly01 has to go down in history as one of the most effective trolls ever in the history of the internet. 132 responses and still going strong? And this discussion is more on topic than 99% of serious threads here!</p>

<p>Not on the news for months? There are still people dying here in England of swine flu. And the nice map on <a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8083179.stm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8083179.stm</a> shows you the changes that have happened in the last few months.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way ‘overhype’ is made of redundant.</p>

<p>Your source is BBC, which invalidates the rest of your arguement</p>

            <p>Just like influenza is a pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, it’s still on the news once in a while here (Canada), and they did mention the “second wave” that will come this winter, and I’m pretty sure we’ll have another wave of media hype over the virus then. But it’s still is a very rarely-lethal virus, there’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Edit: finally an update from Maddox… I hope someone gives him swine flu lol</p>
