    <title>iPod replacement</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ipod-replacement/2495</link>
    <description>Recently I just put my iPod Nano (4th generation, the one immediately prior to the video shooting nano) into a washing machine, and of course, it won&#39;t turn and all the electronics are fried. I know that Apple doesn&#39;t cover water damage, so does anybody know of any lies I can make up so they can replace mine with a free one?</description>

            <p>Apple won’t replace it should have gotten a warranty from the store most have them. If you feel up to you could buy a new one from best buy under warranty then put it the broken one in the box and get two working iPods but thats completely dishonest.</p>

            <p>I’ve got a really good idea for an excuse, but part of it requires that you’ll have to go to Best Buy and give them $400 to convince Apple that you need a new one.</p>
