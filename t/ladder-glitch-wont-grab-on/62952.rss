    <title>Ladder Glitch - Won&#39;t Grab On</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ladder-glitch-wont-grab-on/62952</link>
    <description>In the same level as my first bug report - On a Rail - after closing off the gates and activating the rocket, you reach a part where the tram will go up an elevator shaft to the outside. If you climb up the ladder instead, and step off on each floor, when I try to grab the ladder, Gordon won&#39;t and just falls instead. I try holding forward and looking up, but he just won&#39;t latch onto it.</description>
