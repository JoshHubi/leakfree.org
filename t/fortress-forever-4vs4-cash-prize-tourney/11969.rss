    <title>Fortress Forever 4vs4 Cash Prize Tourney!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fortress-forever-4vs4-cash-prize-tourney/11969</link>
    <description>Just ran across this today.
Fortress Forever (remake of TFC classic) is having a 4x4 contest paying cash to winners.

The top tier teams will be competing for $800
The low tier teams will be competing for $200

Looks like it begins Feb 1 so, if you use to be good at TFC Classic then here&#39;s your chance to win some bucks.

I use to play this and really enjoyed it but, got older and kind of gave up on it.


Anyway, for those who are interested, here&#39;s the link for info:

            <p>I was top tier player back in the day. Although I’m sure I wouldn’t be that amazing now. I’d be down to join a team if anyone here is thinking of making one.</p>
