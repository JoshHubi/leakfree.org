<p>Are you using the touchpad on a laptop? Plug in a mouse and you won’t have that problem.</p>

</aside>
<p>More specifically: if this solution works but you’d rather not use a mouse, there might also be an option to turn this off. It’s probably a form of protection against accidental mouse movement / clicking while typing: on my laptop, it’s described as “palm detection”. In Control Panel, go to your Mouse settings. I’m guessing the option will be in the very last tab, which is named differently per mousepad / laptop manufacturer. If not, then probably under an “Advanced” button somewhere on that pane.</p>

<p>Well, the game <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> in early access. One of the major benefits of that is being able to fix bugs much more efficiently because people are actually discovering them!</p>

            <p>It seems to be working now. Only the menu is on Fullbright, not the game itself. I was also booting from a save, so that might also be a bad idea. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Could you please follow the instructions in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/620712999968900907/?tscn=1431039438" data-bbcode="true">this thread</a> and see if it helps?</p>
<p>That failing, could you try:</p>
<p>mat_hdr_level 2<br>
mat_fullbright 0</p>
<p>Both on the menu, then in game? And you can’t use old save games with fullbright, either.</p>

<p>I still have Full Brightness stuck. I’ve tried the notepad trick, etc… My DX Level is v9.0, however. Not going to complain, it boosts performance <span class="bbcode-b">greatly. </span>It just makes it look ugly.</p>
<p>It’s amazing that you guys are fixing these bugs so quickly, however!</p>
