    <description>Is Microsoft in the making of a new Xbox?

I Googled &quot;Xbox 720&quot;, but some of the hyperlinks looked false.</description>

<p>Hey wait man, you kinda jumped the gun. When I said hardware updates I was referring to drivers and stuff along those lines, like you know how when you get gfx cards and out of the box they are at a low resolution until you update it’s drivers, and how your gfx card can go to a higher resolution than your actual monitor. Sorry if it sounded like I was implying them to build a new Vita with a higher resolution monitor.</p>
<p>But, I am 99.9% sure that they will release a new Vita with the HDMI output that they took out in a newer version as a scheme to get more profits.</p>

</aside>
<p>Those revisions you keep referring to are known as firmware updates. That’s software, not hardware. Which is exactly what Microsoft keeps doing to their front end on the 360. Thing is, I strongly doubt that the Vita would ever receive a firmware update to increase the display resolution. Plus, if the games are already displaying 720p, there’s no reason to upscale to 1080p just to facilitate having an HDMI cable linking it to a larger monitor, simply because it would look fine as is.</p>

<p>This I can see them doing.  The PSP is one of the few (the only?) systems that anyone actually added features to that just weren’t available anywhere else, in a hardware revision.</p>
<p>And about the higher res screen, would there be much point on a screen that small?</p>

            <p>I don’t think it works that way either. I’m sure the Vita’s screen is made at the exact resolution that the video card in it is outputting so I don’t think updating drivers to make it go to a higher resolution would do anything in that circumstance.</p>

<p>I think that Nintendo should just quit the console business and just sell the games, their hardware is ‘just now’ catching up to PS3 and Xbox</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This may be true, but they’re also making a lot more because their hardware costs less to make, and they’re selling a ton more than Microsoft or Sony.  From a business standpoint, they’re doing great, costs are down and profits are up.  Why change what works?  The only reason Sega got out of the console game is because once people figured out how to burn bootable discs for Dreamcast games, their software sales plummeted, and selling hardware is almost never profitable.  Nintendo is selling enough that they don’t need to stop making hardware.</p>

            <p>I do realize this, that’s where hardware updates come into play. (But why would you need a higher rez on a screen that size?) With hardware updates resolution can be increased and so can performance. I kinda see your point, but the resolution doesn’t matter much for now, they decided to cut back on HDMI output and I bet you it’s a part of a scheme that they are going to add it in a PS Vita 3000 or slim or whatever and maybe that’s when they’ll increase resolution.</p>

            <p>You’re not understanding my point. Yes, the games on the Vita look very nice, but they run at a low resolution because it’s not on a huge screen TV.</p>
<p>Sure Battlefield 3 looks amazing, but you can play it on a 4 year old computer if you run it at 320x280.</p>

            <p>Yes, but this can be fixed over time with a few hardware updates. Remember how the Xbox and PS3 game looked at launch, people thought that Prey was as good as it gets and then a few years down the line we have all these other games like Uncharted, Gears, Battlefield, Mass Effect, and ect. that look beautiful and we go back to prey and are like “This was top-notch? The textures are dated and the bump maps look pretty bad”. Well the PS Vita is just launching I have no fear that In a few years the games will run as fast as a PS3 and look as good, with the combined efforts of hardware updates and game optimization everything will be A-ok.</p>
<p>Think of it like this, the PS Vita just needs to be ‘broken-in’.</p>

            <p>Except for the part where the Vita isn’t running anything nearly as fast as the PS3. The only reason it can run games that look close to as nice as the PS3 is because they run at a MUCH lower resolution.</p>

<p>Guaranteed they almost immediately started looking at ways to pack more hardware in a smaller package. So you could say, yeah they’ve been fucking making one for years.</p>

<p>Also, they didn’t start working on a new xbox until at least 3 or 4 years after launch, and by working I mean brainstorming, planing, and ect.</p>
<p>I think that Nintendo should just quit the console business and just sell the games, their hardware is ‘just now’ catching up to PS3 and Xbox which are both over 6 years old, and now there’s the PS Vita which is running almost the same hardware as a PS3 but it’s portable. This is very sad Nintendo, their WiiU 's only competition is the PS Vita, a home console v.s. a handheld.</p>
<p>Why is that it’s only competition you ask? Simple, people will buy the Wii U out of the fact that it’s new, just like people buy CoD nowadays. Then, when the new set of Xbox’s and PS3’s come out next year or are revealed this year the WiiU will be decimated and again be stuck with outdated hardware. TBH most people that play Wii is for it’s exclusives like Zelda and Mario, and Mario is starting to bump me the wrong way right about now.</p>

            <p>Maybe PPC’s are more efficient for dedicated gaming machines? That or they’re just cheaper to buy in large bulk.</p>

            <p>Well, I guess there’s an answer. Maybe consoles are of the few mainstream markets Power PCs can still survive in.</p>

<p>Why? What’s wrong with powerpc?</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not really used anymore to my knowledge. I could be wrong though. Intel and AMD make up the majority of the processor share. The only computers I’ve ever used that had PowerPC processors were the Macs in my high school.</p>
