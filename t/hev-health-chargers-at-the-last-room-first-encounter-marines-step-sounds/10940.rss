    <title>HEV, Health Chargers at the last room + first encounter Marines + step sounds</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hev-health-chargers-at-the-last-room-first-encounter-marines-step-sounds/10940</link>
    <description>When I hold [E], the chargers don&#39;t keep charging. I have to repress [E] over and over to charge, incrementally.

It&#39;s in the room where you&#39;re about to teleport to Xen.

Also, the Marines shout:&quot;Give it up Freeman,&quot; or at least, something with &quot;Freeman&quot; in it. This is a minor detail, but I don&#39;t think they would have had a priority to kill him, the first time they see him.

Finally, the step sounds you hear after you&#39;re landing your feet from a jump sound like at least three hits, as if Gordon has three feet or is a Flamenco dancer.</description>
