    <title>An interesting theory of mine</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/an-interesting-theory-of-mine/5581</link>
    <description>Are some of you familiar with water births? It&#39;s a form of childbirth in which the mother is supported in a birthing pool so that the child is delivered into the warm water. The baby hasn&#39;t been exposed to oxygen yet. I wondered, what would happen if you would keep the baby underwater? The baby could probably live its whole life underwater, as long as it&#39;s not exposed to oxygen. Some people say that there is probably a limit, but we wouldn&#39;t know because no one has researched this. What do you guys think?</description>

            <p>I thought babies being able to survive underwater for longer than normal was because they don’t have an inhale reflex yet, which prevents them from getting water in their lungs. I may, however, be mistaken.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>regarding op - babys can survive underwater for short periods of time, not because babies have gills/ can take oxygen in from the water etc but because their is a natural reflex that closes their windpipe so they cant drown, its a similar process as to what happens in the womb, otherwise babies would drown from having liquid in their lungs as soon as the umbilical cord is cut.</p>
<p>That said water births are supposed to be less stressful on babies and mothers alike since the temperature change for the baby is much reduced and the warm water is suspected of easing the pain experienced by mothers during child birth.</p>
<p>I wouldnt recommend leaving any baby underwater for any length of time though, because thats just dumb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Upon releasing a turd into the toilet, the energy released causes a small quantity of water to be projected into the air. This water usually strikes the genital area. One must take preliminary caution by positioning a small piece of toilet paper upon the surface of the water before projecting the turd into the toilet. This piece of paper will absorb the impact of the turd, thus ensuring the safety of your genitals.</p>
<p>Thank you, and have a very safe, and productive day.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Upon releasing a turd into the toilet, the energy released causes a small quantity of water to be projected into the air. This water usually strikes the genital area. One must take preliminary caution by positioning a small piece of toilet paper upon the surface of the water before projecting the turd into the toilet. This piece of paper will absorb the impact of the turd, thus ensuring the safety of your genitals.</p>
<p>Thank you, and have a very safe, and productive day.</p>
