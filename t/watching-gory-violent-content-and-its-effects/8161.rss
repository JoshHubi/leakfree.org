    <description>I always wanted to know everybody&#39;s opinion about watching Gore vids and Pictures, &quot;am talking about the real Shit not the flicks you see in movies&quot; and it&#39;s effects on you. see at first I kinda freaked out, but then I realized that the more I watch these things the more I don&#39;t get any &quot;tiny&quot; feeling of disturbance! I realized this when I saw a badly mutilated body from a car accident while I was in the hospital, when I saw it I didn&#39;t even feel a thing or disturbed at all!! is this wrong you guys ?</description>

            <p>I saw a car on the highway crashed into a concrete wall and engulfed by flames. The driver’s seat had a crisped skelly in it! Firemen were stunned by the image.</p>

            <p>Shit on the internet never really affected me<br>
I got to see and treat some shit but it wasn’t that serious as well, mostly cuts, wounds etc. Worst thing I saw was some guy who had some nasty fucking laceration in his palm because he had some accident involving a pike.<br>
Car accidents are the worst though. Although never encountered it, but I might soon enough. Some friends who did told me it’s seriously fucked up.</p>

            <p>I could give a link to a site that has the worst things I’ve personally ever seen. However I may well be banned.</p>
<p>As someone already said, as long as you feel empathy any morbid curiosity shouldn’t be considered taboo? I’ve had an interest in these kinda things for many years. The human body is much more fragile than the movies want you to believe.</p>

            <p>I had a psychotic episode a few nights ago.<br>
After playing too much WoW I had a complete mental breakdown and ran through the streets with an axe shouting “FOR THE ALLIANCE!”.  Unfortunately I couldn’t find any Gnolls or Wild Boars to kill, so I chased a Squirrel for an hour before the police picked me up.</p>

            <p>I’m not queasy when it comes to blood and I’ve not dealt with really any gore asides from roadkill, which I feel bad when I see. I’ve seen plenty of gore online, not in games but on r/gore, i went there once cause a friend of mine had brought it up and what I saw on it haunted me for days afterwards because as Sassy said, they were someone’s wife, someone’s brother. A father, a mother. Even a friend. A friend of mine died in an accident involving a rifle and each time I see an image of a mutilated body or a corpse online, I can’t help but think of the pain I felt when I learned of my friends death. I think of how the people in their lives must feel. Watching that documentary, and seeing the WW2 vet getting hit made me cringe because the one thing I can’t stand is prolonged pain and it sickens me that those people watched. I get the concept of Self-Preservation but in my mind there is a responsibility to help another person because I’d desperately want someone to help me if it were I in that situation.</p>

 (rot)(fodder:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Gore is something I can’t say I’ve had much experience with. When I do, so long as my headspace stays within the realms of simple blood and meat, I’m not bothered. The weird thing is, as soon as you start identifying veins, arteries, stuff like that? Bam, I’m useless. weak, sick, gone. Organs don’t bother me, seeing blood doesn’t bother me as long as I don’t ever make the connection to broken veins. It’s been like this forever, although I’m getting better. In science class I used to litterally go paralyzed in my arms sometimes. My muscles would just stop working and I would have to concentrate hard on everything but the lesson in order to get my system back to functioning so that I didn’t look like a complete fool.</p>
<p>Oddly enough though, I wouldn’t have any problem keying someone through the throat who was causing enough trouble to deserve it, and in our martial arts club I would always automatically revert to neck strikes if I forgot something and had to improvise. It was just so much easier, and my mind always had that area targeted, it wasn’t a concious decision.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m kind of like that too. Once, I saw a documentary of someone who used to cut themselves, and I swear, whenever I even just hear about someone cutting themselves or slitting their wrists and stuff, I get kinda paralyzed too!</p>
<p>What’s worse though, is in Vampire movies/shows, when they show the vampire biting the neck and blood gushing out and shit. That and I guess any cutting of the neck also freaks me out…</p>

            <p>Not to say it’s normal or something.  I have never EVER told anyone I hold this interest offline, as it is a point of shame with me.  But you asked, and I told.  Not trying to sound hardcore or extreme, it was just a compulsion I had in younger years that turned into interest and such.</p>
<p>EDIT: And in the beginning, when I first saw such pictures I was quite disturbed…as a matter of fact the pictures frightened me and made me feel sick.  But I still came back for more.  Maybe for that thrill, that feeling of dread, or otherwise.  But I did come back and as I returned, I did indeed become desensitized.</p>
