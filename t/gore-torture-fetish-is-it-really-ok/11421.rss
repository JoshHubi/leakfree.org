    <title>Gore\Torture fetish, is it really ok?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gore-torture-fetish-is-it-really-ok/11421</link>
    <description>well, I haven&#39;t made a serious thread in a while, my cousin was kidnapped from his university by two people, he was missing for 3 days, until the cops finally found him or...what&#39;s left of him, for 3 days those two people were torturing him non-stop, they cut off his fingers, they split his abdomen wide open and were burning him with cigarets, autopsy results said that he was still alive when they did this to him.

the killing blow was with an axe deep inside his neck that nearly decapitated him, his family only recognized him from his clothes and DNA, and guess what, those people where his friends that lived near him, am glad they were captured and now they&#39;re going to get executed for what they have done to him, this torture-killing thing shocked the Jordanian community because we never had this type of thing before.

now the main thing is, when we checked the killers facebook profiles guess what we had found, gore and torture albums filled with horrible pictures, and they were actually enjoying that by commenting like : yummy, awesome, great. after seeing this, I fully believe that every single person who ACTUALLY enjoys this stuff is a sick person who really need immediate mental help. 

sorry for the long text, but I felt I needed to share this</description>

            <p>Shadi I am so sorry for your loss. No one should have to endure knowing a loved one had to go through this. The human race is a puzzling thing to try to understand.</p>

            <p>Mate, as it’s been said already, sympathies to you and your family, but I’m really surprised you have to ask if that’s ‘okay’?</p>
<p>Of course that’s not fucking okay.</p>

<p>Yeah, you can’t really control that kind of lower level deep buried mental shit if it springs from some early stuff that you were exposed to or something like that; stapling a wrong/right thing on that is like stapling the same kind of moral implications on shit like genetics… Actually going out and doing it, though? Of course that’s wrong. Like, holy fucking shit.</p>
<p>That’s absolutely terrible, Shadi. I can’t even think of anything to say to that.</p>

            <p>Fucked up story O_o I feel bad for the families</p>
<p>Anyway<br>
torture ? yeah, why not<br>
I saw some weird sex shit, and some women and men seem to enjoy it, so why not, as long as its willing and not  forced then god bless them</p>
<p>But where the line between really damaging someones body and actually getting pleasure from it i dont know, im not into that.</p>
<p>Gore fetish ?<br>
I would like to say its not ok, since it implies something died or have been mutilated<br>
But i did saw some amazing gory art, and great sexualized gory images, and people much more like bloody games and movies than fake sterile ones<br>
I wonder how much it has to do with being realistic about how fragile our bodies are and how easy its to die, and how much about enjoyment from looking at people get hurt and die</p>
<p>I guess its just a matter if someone will suffer from your fetish or not<br>
In the end, does anybody really care what are you fapping to as long as you keep it to yourself ?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, this doesn’t sound right at all. I’d say the people who are ashamed of such a thing atleast acknowledge that it is wrong and immoral. Unlike the ones who openly enjoy it.</p>
<p>Shadi, I am so sorry for your loss.</p>

            <p>The idea of having a fetish for gore was brought up to be thought of a sign for this kind of behavior but its kinda of irrelevant since most people in modern western culture have some manor of vicarious violence experience.  I didn’t really mean to put people who enjoy violent media in the same league as those who are violent.</p>

            <p>yes they will die for what they did, but the problem still lies with the hundreds if not thousands of people that enjoy the “sadistic pleasure to see someone else suffering” as Blanc said.</p>
<p>oh and one another thing, they filmed him when they did this, but the police managed to take the film before it spreads to a wider public, but a handful of his relatives where able to watch it, and some of them literally had mental breakdown for what they had seen in the recording</p>

            <p>yup, they ran DNA match, I believe it was his father that had the test, and for the “okey” statement, I’ve seen someone posting that it’s really ok to comment and watch this stuff and say whatever you want as long as you don’t do anything real, ya know I remember once I checked a Page on Facebook that actually posts this kind of stuff and it happened that they posted a picture of a small baby shot in his head and his body was mutilated, I swear that there wasn’t any single comment that had any sympathy, most of the comments were like : headshot!, Human turkey, me like, awesome, I said to my self wow…we are really in a fucked up twisted time</p>

<p>this torture-killing thing shocked the Jordanian community because we never had this type of thing before.</p>

<p>I find that surprising. With the rates of brain defects leading to violent psychopathic / sociopathic tendancies, it seems very odd that there hasn’t been something like this before.</p>

<p>now the main thing is, when we checked the killers facebook profiles guess what we had found, gore and torture albums filled with horrible pictures, and they were actually enjoying that by commenting like : yummy, awesome, great. after seeing this, I fully believe that every single person who ACTUALLY enjoys this stuff is a sick person who really need mental help.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It definitely sound like the actions of a defective mind to me. I am not thinking torture fetish is a sign of a properly functioning brain either. But who is actually claiming that a torture fetish is ‘okay’?</p>
