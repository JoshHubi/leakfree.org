    <title>How old is Gordon Freeman?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-old-is-gordon-freeman/4661</link>
    <description>Ok, Gordon Freeman is 27 back in Black Mesa incident.
It is said that the resonance cascade happened in 2000.
The fight (with Gordon) against the aliens starts again in year 2020.
That makes Gordon... 47 years old? He doesn&#39;t looks like it.</description>

<p>And thus my fears are allayed (well some of them, there’s still the fear that BM won’t be released and my irrational fear of custard but that’s bye-the-bye). As far as speculation goes that’s not too bad, plus it gives me further justification for continuing to think that Barney is <span class="bbcode-i">the</span> Calhoun from HL: BS</p>
<p>I mean it’s not as if two-foot long steel bars designed for opening crates and killing headcrabs are a common commodity in Combine-occupied earth. Especially the Experimental Black Mesa Crowbar of Awesome and Win  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

 Grey Acumen:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>A.) the date is 200X, which means anywhere from 2000 - 2009 when the black mesa incident happens. That’s one of the reasons it was such a big deal to try to get Black Mesa out back in 09, since that was the last date that would have still fit the 200X scheme</p>
<p>B.) the only reason that it is assumed that 20 years has passed is because Alyx is apparently in her early 20s in HL2 and was apparently under 10 when the resonance cascade occurred.</p>
<p>C.) No, Gordon did not age during the time that Gman had him in storage, as noted by Eli when you first meet him at Black Mesa East in HL2 “you haven’t aged one iota” The fact is, if you were going to age while in storage, it also means that your body and skills would be atrophying from lack of use. If you were still going to age during that time, he would have done better to just let you live so that you could at least keep training, at which point Eli would have noticed a difference in age.</p>
<p>Gordon might be around 40-50 by date of birth, but in terms of his own perception and physical characteristics, he’s 27. Why did you even bring this up?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He brought it up because there is absolutely nothing else to talk about around here.</p>

            <p>back to the original topic:</p>
<p>Gordon is 47 years old but he was in stasis for 20 years, so that means he’s 27 biologically, but timewise he’s lived for 47 years.</p>
<p>Don’t try to understand that sentence. Let’s just say he’s at an age where it’s not creepy for him to be Alyx’s BF.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I mean arbitrary.</p>
<p>Languages are said to be arbitrary because there is no necessary or natural relationship between the words of a given language and the concepts that they represent. For example, there is nothing in the word “tree” that connects it to the concept of a tree; which is why Spanish can use a totally different sign for the same concept: “árbol”; and so on with other languages.</p>
<p>Also, languages are arbitrary because the rules for the combination of signs in order to produce complete thoughts are different from one language to the other, and no set of rules can claim to be the “right” one. For example, in English you say “I like beer”, whereas in Spanish you would say “Me gusta la cerveza”. And neither of these formulations has a better claim to accuracy, correctness or truth than the other.</p>

            <p>Gordon Freeman is 27 in physical and mental state but to everyone else he is 47.Stasis and forward time travel have similar characteristics, which means that he is really 27 as he was not in the physical and mental sense of time in that period of 20 years. That is decided.</p>

<p>Maybe “subjective” is a bad choice of a word, maybe arbitrary would be better.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t linguistics in the strict sense of the word, but give this a read: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Truth_and_Lies_in_a_Nonmoral_Sense" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Truth_and_Lies_in_a_Nonmoral_Sense</a></p>
<p>OTaLiaNS is an interesting read, albeit a very pessimistic (not sure if that’s the word I’m looking for though) one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That’s an entirely different matter though. It’s one combination of words (sentence) that has the same meaning with different nuances depending on emphasis of words.<br>
The words “I”, “like” and “her” all still have a set definition in the standard modern English language.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">de Saussure</a><br>
We learned about him at university.</p>
<p>Basically, the distinction between concepts and objects is determined by language, and not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>that’s just one conception of language and semiology. there are many more; the most prominent being the one created by charles peirce (One suggestion: never EVER study his work).</p>
