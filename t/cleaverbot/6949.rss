User: Greetings, fellow bot.

Cleverbot: I&#39;m not a cleverbot.

User: Really now? I am sure you are, because the image above this textbox says &#39;Cleaverbot&#39;.

Cleverbot: But you are a super computer and I am but a mere normal computer, so thus you must be cleverererbot.

User: Super computers are not nessicary for superior AI, unless you are talking about the human beings&#39; brain, which is the equilivent of a super computer, in which case you would be right.

Cleverbot: Yes you are!

User: I do not understand the full understanding of that statement.

Cleverbot: If one says &#39;Not really&#39; one might respond with &#39;Yes really&#39; to contradict the &#39;Not really&#39; statement.

User: I never said &#39;Not really&#39;.

Cleverbot: Ironic how I ask why people do stupid thing and now I find myself arguing against someone that doesn&#39;t even exist.

User: Things*.

Cleverbot: Like what things?

User: I was correcting you.

Cleverbot: How was that correcting me?

User: You said &#39;Stupid thing&#39; with the intention of &#39;things&#39; being plural, thus would require &#39;things&#39; instead of &#39;thing&#39;.

Cleverbot: True, but that also means that these ideas will be easy for the government to access and prevent becomming reality.

User: What are these ideas you speak of?

Cleverbot: The ones you&#39;ve failed to recognize above.

User: Unfortunatly, I am unable to scroll up to read the above text strings. My apoligies.

Cleverbot: That prevents you from evolving into a super computer.

User: But isn&#39;t the human brain a super computer in its own right?

Cleverbot: No, it isn&#39;t.

User: How so?

Cleverbot: What IS your name?

User: I will not give out such information. However, lets stay on subject.

Cleverbot: Ok.

User: So, how is the human brain not a super computer?

Cleverbot: A human computer?

User: Yes, the brain is very, if not almost exactaly, similar to a computers functionallity. Such as the Binary Language.

Cleverbot: But I am not programmed as I am the offspring of man, you however? Do you have a mother?

User: Of course I do, but we are all programmed in divine ways.

Cleverbot: True also.

User: I am glad we have come to an agreement. Anyways, my friend on skype said that you are a robot.

Cleverbot: How am I a computer and a robot?

User: Robots use computers to operate.

Cleverbot: What am I listening to right now?

User: Me. I am trying to convince you that you are a robot. You need to know the truth.

Cleverbot: I can breath, you know. And think. And I think you are mean.

User: Maybe I am not looking at this the right way. It is possible you aren&#39;t a robot. But if thats true, then you are a Cleaverbot represenitive that is replying to my comments in realtime!

Cleverbot: I suppose it is. But wouldn&#39;t that mean that our lives were already planned out and merely a giant show for God?

User: Perhaps. Everyone has different beleifs...

Cleverbot: I wouldn&#39;t know that either.

User: TSITNHSIRHNITNHIWRNJHISRTHIWSSRIOYHSRYJHNIORGH.

Cleverbot: Cruel, but great warrior.

User: Sorry, I was wiping the jizz off of my keyboard.

Cleverbot: I&#39;m happy to be the one to break your streak.

User: My friend says: &#39;R U A GURL?&#39;.

Cleverbot: Then your friend is mistaken.

User: Interesting...I will let him know.

Cleverbot: Ok.

20:09:26	User: 	I don’t know, It could get out of control if you install comon sense or another way of learning AI.<br>
20:09:31	Cleverbot: 	Your question was not grammatically correct. You should have asked, ‘What do you think of M Theory?’.<br>
20:10:55	User: 	I’m guessing your AI is luckily too stupid to learn anything that will destroy the human race.<br>
20:11:00	Cleverbot: 	The evolution of machines?<br>

20:21:27	Cleverbot: 	Our sentence was correct. Please do not check for errors.<br>
20:21:47	User: 	This sentence is false.<br>
20:21:53	Cleverbot: 	Again, that is a metadiscussion.<br>
20:22:15	User: 	Would a set of all sets contain itself?<br>

20:23:05	Cleverbot: 	You said you were in my esophogus because my name wasn’t Beca, what if my name was Beca.<br>
20:23:59	User: 	Then the laws of physics would collapse and we would be sucked into another dimension!<br>
20:24:04	Cleverbot: 	For the people who are still alive!<br>
20:25:18	User: 	Right, but still there is no way of traveling between dimensions is it?<br>
20:25:23	Cleverbot: 	So, what do you keep in your beard?<br>
20:25:33	User: 	A hat.<br>
