    <description>Well, I&#39;m unsure if anyone will be able to answer this, but I figured it&#39;d be worth a try!
I&#39;m trying to make a video, and I want to have some papers on a table. Does anyone know how to add your own papers to the Hammer level editor (working with Half-Life ep.2)?</description>

            <p>Oh, I already optimized it, I’m almost finished with it, only problem are the decals, I typed r_drawdecals 0 into the console so there were no decals in the map. It ran much better. Looks like I’ll have to delete some or set some overlays which I can enlarge. But it’s almost finished with optimization.</p>

            <p>Can you play the map or does it crash or something like that?</p>
<p>IIRC when I still had a very slow computer, I had to use commands like these…</p>
<p>try to type these in-game</p>
<p>cl_detaildist #<br>
-this determines how far/near you’ll see details such as grass and trash on the ground. I can’t remember if these are for props or for decals.</p>
<p>mp_decals #<br>
-this will determine the maximum number of decals in your map… I can’t remember if these affect decals you put in hammer.</p>
<p>I like your map but I guess you need to optimize it.<br>

            <p>Especially in dirty corners of the map I used many trash decals and many graffitys on walls. Some screenshots show places where the military tried to fight against insurgents in the streets without success, in that part of town there have been several street fights the last weeks.</p>

            <p>Papers could be overlays or models.<br>
You might to prefer to use overlays if you don’t need the paper to move.<br>
So look up <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Creating_Decals#Standard_decals" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> - to know how to create overlays, or decals<br>
Or <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Model_Creation_Overview" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> - to create your model<br>
And after that the papers will be in your Hammer Editor for you to use.<br>
Good luck!</p>

<p>Well, thanks for the help guys, I’m still hopelessly confused though…<br>
I actually was looking on google and couldn’t find the right thing, so then I did go to the Steam forums. But I’m not a member so when I went to sign up it said a mod had to activate my account. And in my waiting thought of the Black Mesa forums! Lol.<br>
I have a friend who knows how, he’s going to walk me through it anyways.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>i would use some of the default decals, but if you don’t want to do that, maybe  you can make custom decals? i’m not even sure how, or if you can do that, but thats what we have google for, huh?</p>
<p>Last option would to just make a paper model, but it’ll look kinda weird imo when compared to just a decal.</p>
