    <description>Hey there. I&#39;m looking for people who are good with making single player campaign levels. I&#39;m currently working on a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life Antimatter.

If no one can help make campaign levels, at least give me a link for a Hammer Editor tutorial for Single Player Campaign levels. Thanks.</description>

<p>Hey there. I’m looking for people who are good with making single player campaign levels. I’m currently working on a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life Antimatter.</p>
<p>If no one can help make campaign levels, at least give me a link for a Hammer Editor tutorial for Single Player Campaign levels. Thanks.</p>

<p>You should probably get some more experience in Hammer before you think of starting a mod. Start with something easier, like Deathmatch maps, that is what I am doing right now.</p>

            <p>Hey there. I’m looking for people who are good with making single player campaign levels. I’m currently working on a mod for Half-Life 2 called Half-Life Antimatter.</p>
<p>If no one can help make campaign levels, at least give me a link for a Hammer Editor tutorial for Single Player Campaign levels. Thanks.</p>
