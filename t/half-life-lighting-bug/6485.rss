    <title>Half-Life Lighting Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-lighting-bug/6485</link>
    <description>I have a problem in the original GoldSrc Half-Life which creates a problem in the form of frequent interruptions within the game, it always happens whenever there is any sort of lighting flashing in and out, and it also affects the latency as well whenever I try to play a multiplayer game.  

Is this an issue with the Windows 7 64-bit system I use?  I&#39;m not sure.</description>

<p>Are you using DirectX or Open GL? Did you upgrade your video card drivers, or are you using whatever Windows provided? Keep in mind that GoldSrc is very old, and you might need to tell it to run using some different parameters. Try changing it to OpenGL if you’re using DirectX, and vice-versa. Make sure that you’re not running in software emulation mode, that will kill framerates.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, I changed the video setting from OpenGL to D3D and now it does not lag anymore.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
