    <description>I did a thing.

So basically I wanted to practice my cylindrical modeling and and some other stuff, and here we have the results.

The arms are designed to appear a bit more like the ones found in Gearbox&#39;s HD pack for Half-Life. While totally compatible with MP, they aren&#39;t compatible with other viewmodel mods as far as I&#39;m aware. If they are, someone should tell me how the Hell they managed that. ^^ 


They don&#39;t appear with the Gauss because I can&#39;t seem to rig them to it without breaking the universe. I&#39;ll hopefully have it fixed by the time I update the pack for the December Update.

<p>To clarify what I mean - I’ve only ever seen the hand-swap affect the crowbar and magnum. The trigger for it in-game seems to be <span class="bbcode-i">switching</span> to one of the dynamic animation weapons - I haven’t personally seen the glitch appear when switching between any other weapons. It’s just the dynamic animation weapons that cause it for me.</p>
<p>I realize there doesn’t seem to be much you can do about it at the moment, but I figured it might be worth making a note of this anyways.</p>

            <p>I noted this on the Workshop page as well, but I figure it’s worth noting here as well - it occurred to me that all the weapons that <span class="bbcode-i">cause</span> the HECU-arms bug to occur are the grenade category weapons (frag, tripmine, satchel, snark) and the crossbow (EDIT2: And the RPG, I forgot about that) - in other words, all the weapons with <span class="bbcode-i">dynamic animations.</span></p>
<p>Seeing as it seems to be a bug in Black Mesa itself, I dunno how much that’s worth, but I can’t help but feel that there’s some relation there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, since I don’t think I’ve said it on the Workshop, I’d just like to say - I absolutely <span class="bbcode-i">love</span> how these sleeves look. They’re great.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about something, now that the arms are almost done (Gauss missing from what you say). It’s pretty much a request, so let’s get to it:</p>
<p>When BM first came out, someone made an HD pack for it (it’s still on GB as far as I’m aware), with M16/M4, Beretta (if I’m not mistaken), a new Shotgun, .357, and many more. There were also new hand models.</p>
<p>What I’d like to ask if you could do a similar pack, with a M4, new Shotgun, Beretta, and what else was significantly altered by the HD pack in HL1, using these hands. Or, if not possible, if you could rig the hands on that weapons, if the author would allow this.</p>
<p>I’ve seen that you’ve made a new Gluon and Mk II grenade so far  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Whoaho. Thankies.<br>
Jeez, I thought it turned out pretty decent but I didn’t expect so many people to actually like it. Especially considering how basic it is, and all the issues I didn’t catch before releasing. Well, whether I personally believe it’s worthy of the popularity or not, I’m super glad people  like it! I was hoping my first Workshop submission wouldn’t be considered total garbage and it seems I’ve actually managed.<br>
Though now I feel especially obligated to fix those issues ASAP, which is sorta hard as I’m strapped for time lately.</p>

            <p>Correct. I think I posted about it a few times in the last couple pages of the Show Off thread. I mostly avoid acknowledging it until it’s finished, but I wanted an interesting map for a screenshot of the sleeves.</p>

            <p>Thankies!</p>
<p>I’m amazed you even remembered FD was a thing. It’s going slowly. Mostly focusing on HC (which there is also a tease of  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ), and working on these arms in down time soon because my work for HC is basically done.</p>

<p>I’m considering slapping on the handpack from the original HL model, if you think that’d be cool.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’d be perfect, what you’ve done so far is vastly improved from the vanilla model, both in quality and aesthetics. Also, nice tease of Further Data at the top, how’s progress been with that?</p>

<p>Was never a fan of the HD pack itself, but this is definitely a nice model. Its design is simple, in a good way. Really compliments the research/non-commercial application of the HEV suit. And I’d personally love the handpack on it.</p>
<p>As for other weapon replacements, it’d take decompiling to get these arms on them. Would be nice if the arm models were separate from the weapons/each other, but I imagine the BM viewmodels are like HL2’s, where unused portions of the arms were removed on different weapons. This could make implementing it potentially require reanimation for some weapons, so I’d hesitate to ask the devs to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I overall prefer the original models to the HD pack but the arms in it are nice. I do miss that hand thingy though.</p>
<p>And yeah, I already know you can’t circumvent the conflicting viewmodels. Shame.</p>

            <p>The crossbow scope not work, I mean when you want to zoom the scope is just a strange and bizarre dark, making the zoom impossible to use.<br>
Other than that, I loved the sleeves, I thought it might be one of the best remodels ever made and I would love you put the handpack of the original HL1.</p>
