Happy summer all! We hope that everyone is having a great start to their summer. To celebrate, we proudly present to you our first public screenshots of a Xen exterior. All running real-time, in- game, with no edits.

[img=&#39;https://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/a747b51d505718fda2509877c4e6816e27ea4bf4.jpg&#39;,none,960][/img]

Unfortunately, as some of you may have already predicted, we are going to need to push back our planned release of Xen to later this year, in December. We know that this is not what anyone would want to hear, but after taking a long and hard look at what we want to achieve, we have decided that this is for the best. We do not want to compromise on Xen’s quality in any way. That said, we consider December to be a do-or-die deadline.

To soften the blow of the bad news, here are some additional tidbits and updates regarding what we have done for Xen so far.

[b]Example of the Level of Detail We Are Going For[/b]
[img]https://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/acf583169cb574d192be207b0e7017cb6d2b4eee.jpg[/img]

[b]Interloper Map B Scale[/b]
[img]https://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/33c2f236eabd91a4582509a0cac7922ea121c4d5.png[/img]

[b]New Dynamic Light System[/b]
As part of our continued efforts to bring Xen’s graphics up to the best possible standard that they can be, we have upgraded Source to a new deferred rendering system that supports fully dynamic lights! These new “next-gen” lights cast real-time light, shadows and god rays. These won’t replace all the lights in the game, but we can use them in many special cases where we want the lights to be particularly gorgeous. These lights are much better optimized than other Source implementations of dynamic lights, and are more robust.

Not only will this new lighting system help crank parts of the the game up to 11 in terms of graphical fidelity, these will also be powerful tools for modders as well!

[b]Color Correction[/b]
We’ve started a color correction pass for the whole game. The goal is to better unify the game’s visual style and to add full screen effects during the more intense sections. Most of these effects will be quite subtle, but here is a more noticeable example.

[img]https://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/c9fada20d4280e33d335e2ef8099c4a5c4143f93.gif[/img]

[b]Weapon Holds[/b]
We fixed the soldiers holding the weapons wrong. It took some serious animation trickery to retarget the bones on top of the existing Half-Life 2 animation library, but it worked well once we figured it out. No more hands clipping through the guns!

[img=&#39;https://cdn.edgecast.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/8672783/e6aca5c89dc8a93a761e04113d2a87498f29ab11.jpg&#39;,none,960][/img]

Thanks as always to you guys, our wonderful community, for your support! As always, we will continue to work at full speed on Xen, and we hope to have more updates, information and media for you guys soon.</description>

            <p>I have never thought the Steam community can be as salty as it is currently and I have been on Steam for a good while.<br>
Huge respect for the devs, they must be feeling something… interesting in these “troubled times”.<br>
I think those BM lens flrares look pretty great.</p>

            <p>It’s a shame that guy seems to attacks programmers on our team specifically, because I would argue that, since the retail release, programming have been the department who have most consistently delivered on what was needed and have most consistently had their shit together, saving all our asses.</p>
<p>Our level designers? Man, those guys are the real incompetent ones! /sarcasm, in case it was needed![/size]</p>

<p>Yeah, we’ve tried our best to keep it relatively tasteful. We do understand that the HL universe is mostly quite subtly represented and isn’t packed to the brim with flashy special effects. In fact, most of us don’t really like all the flashy modern game postprocessing effects, so we’ve built them as tastefully as we can. We think they really add to scenes, and we delete them if they detract.</p>

<p>You guys are a joke for programmers</p>

</aside>
<p>Do you have <span class="bbcode-i">ANY idea</span> what goes into making a game engine work, let alone the scripting that comes after? What they’ve done takes a fuck ton of effort, <span class="bbcode-i">a lot </span>more effort than building a brand new game from scratch.</p>
<p>Fitting a new feature into the existing framework is very difficult, because the entire code is essentially a web, one fuck up and you’ll make the entire thing crash down around you while it laughs in your face. Shoehorning something into the existing framework is not easy, it takes skill. I believe that’s one of the most difficult things to do in programming <span class="bbcode-i">before </span>reverse engineering code. The code has likely been done for months, the <span class="bbcode-i">art</span> <span class="bbcode-i">assets </span>take a lot more time to create, especially something that’s up to snuff with the rest of the game.</p>
<p>As far as the game being delayed the old addage, “better it be delayed and come out good, than to come out rushed and shitty,” applies here. The lens flare looks cool. Love all y’all, and while I still lurk here, this community and the devs have been great to me over the years.</p>

            <p>I havent logged into this in a long time because you know what? I didn’t care but after your “do or die” delay, I think it’s time to kill your selves… Slowly. Your fags can not program shit from your own assholes. This game looks like pure dog shit for how long it’s been in development. Pure uncanny North Korean dog shit. You guys are a joke for programmers and no wonder you’re working on this for free. No reputable company would hire you because of your shitty skills. As a result in claiming fraud for my purchase and getting a damn fucking refund. I refuse to support your company. You guys are a terrible joke. Now please. Do at least what you promised with the do or die offer. Die</p>

            <p>Disappointed, but understandable, take your time, guys!<br>
You shouldn’t have promised a deadline that you are not 100% confident in, but I still believe that word said by Shigeru Miyamoto<br>
“A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad”.<br>
We will support you for your work all the time.</p>
<p>感谢你们的辛苦与努力！/Thank you for your hard work and effort!</p>

            <p>Well, can’t say I’m not dissapointed or let down but oh well. We’ll get it when we get it.</p>
<p>Pretty excited about the lighting upgrades/changes/additions though, they look sweet! Especially loved the shot with the police car sirens.</p>

<p>i am excited for this too will update dm_wgh with what ever the BM devs change in the level with it have some plans for balacing on the map too</p>
<p>my other question is how is the optimization in the next update is there any specific pushes for it?<br>
cause im annoyed that i run at barely 30 to 45 FPS in black mesa SP and i know source doesn’t take advantage of multi cored CPU’s properly<br>
ive noticed that the new dynamic lights run better according to the posts prior</p>

            <p>I’ll be honest. I’m extremely upset and disappointed in you guys.</p>
<p>Perhaps, even a bit angry.</p>
<p>No, quite mad, in fact.</p>
<p>How is it possible that a quick copy/paste little mod like this is taking over a decade to get finished?</p>
<p>Are you just jerking off all the time to R34 of Bob Saget? I mean, at least have some better taste, for shit’s sake.</p>
<p>Do you need to hire The Benz to get your crappy little middle school project on the finish line?</p>
<p>Just get your act together, kids.</p>
<p>Anyway, take your time and brush your teeth at least two times a day, boys and girls.</p>
<p>Hugs and kisses, Uncle Maxey.</p>

            <p>Sounds reasonable. Just stick to internal deadlines for the time being. I’m absolutely fine with waiting (especially when I know for a fact that you guys are trying your hardest), but I would still take no information on release dates over release dates that cannot be met any day.</p>

            <p>We’re keeping it internal until we are absolutely 100% confident we can meet it. We were very confident about December too, and that did not go as planned, so we will not make the same mistake 3 (THREE) times.</p>
