    <description>Has anyone heard of the new shooter Singularity?


I saw a trailer and it seemed cool...But I want to know what I might be spending (or wasting) my money on.</description>

            <p>Singularity is really interesting game. I purchased the PC version last week. The end of the game is really interesting as well as many other features.</p>

            <p>It actually is a really solid game.  Although I personally wouldn’t pay full retail price, wait for a sale on steam.  Although its nothing majorly original it combines successful elements quite well. It rarely feels repeative.  It has a good storyline imho and actually one of the endings the one I consider the “Evil” one (although that’s up for debate)  I find deliciously ironic.  This threads only criticism of it is that it lacks major originality but there have been pleaty of other things that borrow many elements and still was great.</p>

            <p>I was reading up on it, and the TMD that you use in the game ends up feeling pretty gimmicky because you can ONLY use it on certain things.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/maxey">@Maxey</a>, Jedi Academy and the X-Men Legends games were good too, but yeah, most of their shit stinks</p>

            <p>Yes, but correct me if I’m wrong. Batman: Arkham Asylum was a 3rd person game designed for stealthier gameplay and still had a large array of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>If you removed the guns from Singularity with how it’s currently designed it wouldn’t be much fun because the TMD is barely combat usable and the atmosphere isn’t good enough to sustain the game.</p>
<p>Anyway, my brother and I both just beat the game and neither of us can figure out the ending. Two of them make sense and are pretty straight-forward, but the one that primarily focuses on Renko is a bit… confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers in ending Questions</strong><br>
Ok, so when you go back in time to kill yourself, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why doesn’t Devichev pick up the gun on the floor and shoot you in the back? He has plenty of time to do so.</li>
<li>Once you are in the past, why shoot yourself and create a weird paradox? Just shoot Devichev off your back and you’d be good to go.</li>
</ol>
<p>And then question about the beginning:<br>
If the singularity isn’t built until after you move backwards through time, what causes the initial “Singularity Burst” that allows you to save Devichev? It can’t just be the E99 everywhere, because the later story seems to imply that it’s the singularity destabilization that causes full time destabilization.<br>

            <p>Games like this are always ruined by getting too many guns.</p>
<p>I haven’t played it yet, but my prediction: This game would be infinitely more fun if it were changed so the protagonist never picks up a gun and has to MacGyver his way through with the Glove-Time-Machine thing. I mean, imagine Batman: Arkham Asylum with guns; it would suck.</p>

bioshock concept to it a bit.</p>
<p>then again dead space was very small at first but i remember reading that in a tiny article back in the day, was worth it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

It’s not the best game ever, I am a little confused on the controls on the Ps3.<br>
Overall it’s a good game, but it can’t be compared to Half-Life.<br>
It’s <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">not that</span></span> good.</p>
