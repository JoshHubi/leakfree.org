    <title>Mistakes made by Valve</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mistakes-made-by-valve/5426</link>
    <description>I think there were enough occasions in which Valve has wasted precious time and provided time for some projects not so important..like free games instead to focus on key titles, I know there is a big team but they need all the potential because, to create a game it takes too much time
The reason for Ep 3 delay is &quot;the release of Episode 1 in June 2006. Episode 2 arrived more than a year after the first release in the series, coming bundled with [u]Team Fortress 2 and Portal[/u] as part of The Orange Box in November 2007. Valve has not offered a time frame for the release of Episode 3&quot;
Even though making these two games was necessary, had to pay as much attention for Ep 3 too</description>

<p>Valve DID make a mistake by needlessly altering the engine of so many  games to get everything on the same level. Until then, they had a mantra  that made sense; to keep older games like HL2 working in the same way  rather than needlessly increasing an older game’s system requirements  with engine updates. Plus, some mods would still like to use the  original HL2; that’s now pretty difficult though.</p>

            <p>You guys found a lot of inconveniences about Valve but it’s about the slow development of the games;making of Half-Life 2 took six years, the reason? development of Source engine and Steam platform, now they have Steam and Source, a game like HL2 should be completed in less than 6 years now</p>

<p>A couple people have said Valve doesn’t make mistakes. That’s usually true, but I can think of two;</p>
<ol>
<li>HL2 2003 Release Date</li>
<li>Ricochet</li>
</ol>
<p>Those were both pretty bad.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How can you call the first one a mistake? They weren’t betting on being hacked by some german psycho.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steam for Mac is the single most horrific thing Valve has ever done. I don’t mind the fact that every game they’ve ever released has been called vaporware at one point or another: translating Steam to Mac ruined hundreds of mods, good and bad, and in one foul swoop completely destroyed my interest in the mod community.</p>
<p>all because they wanted to extend their reaches to the Mac.</p>
<p>MACS ARE NOT PCS. THEY ARE FOR ARTY SHIT AND NOTHING ELSE. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COMPUTER FOR GAMING AND ANYTHING USEFUL, GET A FUCKING PC. IF YOU’RE AN ART STUDENT OR A COLLEGE KID OR A RICH INDIE FUCKING HIPSTER GET A MAC. you mac users ruined the only thing we had left.</p>
<p>i hope you’re proud of yourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Right and wrong.</p>
<p>Valve DID make a mistake by needlessly altering the engine of so many games to get everything on the same level. Until then, they had a mantra that made sense; to keep older games like HL2 working in the same way rather than needlessly increasing an older game’s system requirements with engine updates. Plus, some mods would still like to use the original HL2; that’s now pretty difficult though.</p>
<p>However, thinking that way about macs just makes the PC crowd edge away from you. As much as I love all the extra things my Windows computer does, I have to admit it is sometimes prone to extreme problems. I can fix them because I know a lot about computers, but many people couldn’t. Just someone who’s not a complete geek would probably have a higher interest in macs for their longer lifetime. Catering to another audience (except for the case of the above paragraph because they handled it poorly) doesn’t hurt anyone.</p>
