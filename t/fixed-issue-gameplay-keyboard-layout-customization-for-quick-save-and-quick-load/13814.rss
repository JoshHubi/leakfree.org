    <title>[FIXED] Issue &gt; Gameplay &gt; Keyboard Layout Customization for Quick Save and Quick Load</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-issue-gameplay-keyboard-layout-customization-for-quick-save-and-quick-load/13814</link>
    <description>From playing the steam version I ran into an issue where the quick save and quick load keys are not rebindable.  This is an issue for me personally because I use the steam screenshot method, which I have mapped to f7.  Essentially, screwing me over whenever I attempt to take a screenshot by loading the last manual save.  There is no option in the keybindings menu to rebind these keys, this is what I would consider a gameplay issue and should be fixed.  Yes, I know, I could rebind the steam screenshot key to something else, but believe it or not, I&#39;ve never had to do that.  No other game has had this or a similar issue for me.</description>

            <p>It let me rebind them to f9/f11(save/load), but when i go to options&gt;keyboard it shows them bound to the default keys. My rebinds work, but so do the default ones which is wierd and would, as you said, cause problems with your screenshot key.<br>
I wonder if manually editing the binds in config.cfg and then making the file read-only would work? Since the game shouldn’t be able to change it on its own.</p>

            <p>Confirmed. I also have no Quick Save or Quick Load options. (In case it’s an isolated issue.)</p>
