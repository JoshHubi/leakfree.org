    <title>Viva La Vida by Coldplay- Devl&#39;s arrangement.</title>

     First off, I play trumpet. I have been playing for four years, and I will keep playing until I die. I don&#39;t like to brag, but I&#39;m one of the best trumpeters in the region, in the best marching band in the region. I decided sit down, take a song I liked, transpose it, and write it out. This is the final product. It took me roughly 2.5 hours to finish completely. I took all of this from some piano music I printed out, popped the notes up a whole step or so, and thought it sounded pretty good. Take a look and see what you think of it.  :slight_smile: 

Second of all, I guess this will be the thread where I post all of my covers, music videos (on the trumpet, I can&#39;t sing,) and all music related objects. I welcome everyone else to post their original (or covered) songs!</description>

<p>It sounds amazing, it feels like something from an old school Final Fantasy game.</p>
<p>Please tell me you have more of these delicious musics.</p>

<p>This was my first arrangement. I’ll probably make more covers sometime soon.</p>

<p>Neat-o. Now record yourself playing both parts and I promise to listen all the way through.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I was thinking of having me and a couple friends do it. I need three because the first part splits into divisi (division of a single part) a couple times.</p>
