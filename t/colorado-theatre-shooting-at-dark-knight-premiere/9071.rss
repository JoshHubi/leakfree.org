    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/colorado-theatre-shooting-at-dark-knight-premiere/9071</link>
    <description>It&#39;s all over the news: the deadly shooting at a colorado theatre during the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. 12 confirmed dead, lots wounded.

But here comes an extremely eerie thing:

Amongst the dead is a woman who twitters under the name Jessica Redfield. Check her last blogpost from june 5th [url]https://jessicaredfield.wordpress.com/[/url]

It&#39;s final destination-like eerie.
Goosebumps, damn!

<p>No, not possible. You have to have equally recognizable colors. Red and Blue are OK, but Green or Yellow are much more recognizable to human eye, so whoever would be on Red team while playing against Yellow team would have a much better position.</p>

It’s simple.</p>
<p>You distance the guy from ourselves.  You give him attributes which most people wouldn’t  be able to relate to and then you blame the crimes on this.</p>
<p>You know, I absolutely agree. There is a thing called PC-media in sweden that tries to shoot down everything that isn’t pc…absolutely everything, for example if someone is a bit islamic-critic, your are automatically called rightwing racist. I don’t actually fall into any of those categories, but, man does that jiggle my bunhole when they lie us right to our faces. jeez</p>
<p>edit: I got so upset so I forgot OP…that’s just a fucking disaster for mankind…what a total shitcock. I hope he burns in the electric chair for this.</p>
<p>Killing as many aliens as possible in a given time, though, is patriotic…yeah that would be the “winners” choise of words…allways bee like that and allways will be, allthough when I was 12-15 yo kid I learned that the Finnish-Russian war was about liberation, Russians said it was a matter of Finns invading Russian territory…there you go. I got my facts straight anyways… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>Absolutely: BUT, I wouldn’t call them peers…they are fucking scum of the earth, and allthough I never got bullied I saw some pretty awful things. I’d like to blame the parents for this but some assholes just don’t get what scarres they leave behind. One of my favorite comforts is that those cocksuckers usually end up with wellfare or shitty jobs that totally drive to alcoholism and / or drugabuse…haha FU</p>
<p>shit this post got all messed up because I am shit poor using the quote button. sorry.</p>

<p>It’s simple.</p>
<p>You distance the guy from ourselves.  You give him attributes which most people wouldn’t  be able to relate to and then you blame the crimes on this.</p>
<p>Sure, we could have a serious social debate concerning the REAL reasons as to why this happened, but that’s boring shit for a newspaper.  What we need is HARD. HITTING. REPORTS. which blame shit we have nothing to do with so that we can quickly criticize and then sleep well at night.</p>
<p>Remember the Korean guy who got the high score on campus a few years back?<br>
He was bullied badly the entire time he was at university.  The guy was pretty much driven to a mental break down by these bullies.<br>
Do we stop and examine how bullying from other people (considered to be well respected students) could have caused his killing spree?  No, of course not, because this would be acknowledging that the thoughtless actions by people like you or I could cause someone to break down in such a way.  Even worse is the idea that your child could be driven to such ends by his or her peers.<br>
So we would rather portray this person as an inhuman monster who bares no resemblance to the rest of us ‘normal’ people.</p>
<p>Instead, they came to the conclusion that he was Korean and therefore watched violent Korean films and that this was obviously the cause.<br>
As it happened, they brought up the film Oldboy, despite there being no evidence that he had ever watched the film.</p>

            <p>…That kind of makes me want to kill someone. But then it would be blamed on video games, not the media blaming them, and someone else would kill someone because of it, and before we know it, the world will be in three camps; People who have gone insane because of idiots blaming games for everything bad in the world, the idiots, and corpses.</p>
<p>So that’s a bad idea.</p>

<p>How does that even make any goddamn sense? They pretty much accused the game of depriving him of a normal social life, to account for his psychosis. Media are idiots, that is all.</p>

            <p>The link between games and violence is real guys.<br>
Seriously.<br>
I mean, just look at history.  There were never any wars until Pong was released.<br>
In fact, every time a kid plays a violent video game s/he goes out and commits an act of aggression.<br>
Saddam Hussein was a huge Quake 3 fan.  George Bush Jr. loved Tetris.<br>

<p>I never said you gotta be said or depressed about it. I just think that making jokes about it isn’t the right way of dealing with it…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So what is the right way of dealing with it?</p>
<p>Oh, I know: Let’s go on television and START BLAMING COMPUTER GAMES! Yes, that will make the loss of lives meaningful.</p>
<p>And we better start blaming someone quick, or it might turn out that it’s not the movies or games that’s spawning these retards, it’s our retarded country where 60% of children are conceived at the backseats of a car that’s spawning them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">How come there was a 6 year old shot at the movie? What the fuck was a 6 year old doing at that movie??? Shouldn’t someone blame the theatre for allowing such young kid go to a movie like that?</span></p>
<p>Careful, now, such thoughts are dangerous! <span class="bbcode-i">If we dug too deep, we might realize that our whole rating system is retarded, when it rates “Display of nipple” as more dangerous (15+) than the display of cruel violence (PG-13).</span> No, stop thinking in this direction, place the blame on someone else, quick!</p>
<p>BAN VIDEOGAMES! Quickly! Call the disbarred lawyer who was suing computer game companies!</p>
<p>=========<br>
All right, now seriously: Humor is evolutionary perk which humans developed over the ages as a psychological self-defense mechanism. It is a way how to deal with THINGS THAT DON’T WORK AND WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.</p>
<p>That’s why you have so many jokes about cops and mothers-in-law, and so few jokes about train conductors and fathers-in-law. That’s why you have so many jokes about cancer, death, war or education institutions, and so few jokes about men-to-men friendship (and even those few are more of an anecdote than a joke).</p>
<p>So, in a sense, the humor is a sign that those joking about it are past the initial thought of “OMG it’s horrible”, and now in the stage <span class="bbcode-i">“How the fuck could something like that happen, considering how fucked up our civil liberties in USA nowadays are? What are all the cameras, screenings, coat-checks, infrared goggle guys etc. for, if a man can enter a cinema with automatic weapon and start shooting? There’s something fundamentally wrong, and {I} suspect that the action our powerful will take will NOT be for the better, it will actually make things even worse. That’s why {I am} joking about it. I disagree with the situation and cannot improve it.”</span></p>

</aside>
<p>You think french dubbing is bad? You should hear the fucking horrid dubbing they do in Russia, Ukraine or Lithuania. They don’t even bother turning off the original soundtrack, but rather dub on top of original voices. So you hear two different voices coming out of one characters mouth with a slight delay between them.</p>
<p>Also: Where’d you get that beauty scar tough guy? Eating PINEAPPLE?</p>
