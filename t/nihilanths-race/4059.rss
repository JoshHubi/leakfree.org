    <description>Please read this [url]https://members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/index.htm[/url]
This half-life story guide looks very accurate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----the Overwatch attempt to [b][u]re-enslave[/u][/b] the Vortigaunts, with some success. The Combine&#39;s ultimate purpose is to convert all of humanity into stalkers, and all of the vortigaunts into the slaves they[b][u] were before Gordon freed them[/u][/b].-----

So does that mean, in HL1, the vortigaunts, Alien Grunts, Controllers were with the COMBINE... Then why did Nihilanth summon Vortiguants, Alien Grunts, and Controllers to fight Gordon :freeman: if they were [b][u]enemies[/u][/b]?!?!?!?!?!? 

-----While fighting each other, the humans and Combine also have the threat of Nihilianth&#39;s race. The freed Vortigaunts ally with the rebel forces, wanting [b][u][B][U]revenge[/u][/b][/U][/B] against the Combine. The headcrabs, being headcrabs, just attack anyone they can find. Other monsters find their place assaulting both Man and Combine.-----

Revenge? Revenge for being slaves by the Combine and not Nihilanth?

Found this in BMS wiki
-----The Vortigaunt, Vort, or Alien Slave, is a [b][u]Xenian lifeform[/u][/b] which serves as the primary soldier of the [b][u]Xenian army[/u][/b]. It is a brown humanoid creature with mottled skin, three arms and 4 eyes. Vortigaunts are seen wearing &quot;Slave Bracelets&quot; in Half-Life; graphical evidence that they are being [b][u]enslaved and controlled by the Nihilanth.[/u][/b] Vortigaunts tend to attack in groups and also [b][u]cooperate against enemy forces with Alien Grunts[/u][/b]-----

WTF?!?!? I THOUGHT THEY WERE COMBINE!?!?!?!

<blockquote>
<p>I have a few other questions…</p>
<p>When Gordon Freed the Vortigaunts… did the vortigaunt ally with the human immediately or when the combine started to take over? I mean… did Vortigaunts fight humans when they first met them or did they realize that they were Gordon Freeman’s kind? Also… how did the Vortigaunts send the message to every other Vortigaunt that it was Gordon freeman who freed them? Telepathy? Also… what happened to the Agrunts and Controllers after the Vorts have been released? I mean… what did they do and not how they became extinct.</p>
<p>Any theories?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>what I think is that the vorts were some xen fauna fighting against the human race, the combine and other xenians for long time (maybe 3 or 5 years) also remember we (gordon) appeared 20 years after black mesa incident and the nihilianth’s portal to a combine world got opened in… a half day?. Returning to what I was saying: after those 3/5 years the combine discovered there were vortigaunts in the earth, they thinked about killing them but then remembered the perfect slaves they were and started hunting and capturing them.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, according what I said some repplies before, the controllers and the agrunts were only loyal to the Nihilianth so the combine had no other option than killing them.</p>

</aside>
<p>There isn’t much that’s known about the period during Gordon’s stasis, so we can only speculate how the vortigaunts became allied with the humans and what happened to the a-grunts and controllers.</p>
<p>As for telepathy…when you’re talking to Alyx about Nova Prospekt, she says that “every now and then a vortigaunt gets captured and sends back information”, implying that the vorts have some sort of telepathic connection. They frequently refer to the All-in-One and the vortessence, suggesting they have some sort of telepathic link to which they ascribe spiritual significance.</p>
<p>EDIT: It is also stated in the commentary for Episode 2 that the vorts’ affinity for Dr. Magnusson caused some of his mannerisms to spread among the vortigaunts due to this low-grade telepathy, as evidenced by the way the Victory Mine Vortigaunt says “What next in this parade of constant interruptions?”, the very same line Magnusson uses later in White Forest.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m not sure if this theory has already been posted but what if the combine used the creatures in Xen as scouts? We know that Nihilanth appears to be enslaved to someone and that he hold the Vort’s as slaves, but what if when he says “We are their slaves” he’s referring solely to himself and the controllers, who under the order of the combine, create the alien grunts for use with their slaves, the Vort to scout suitable worlds for the combine to find and invade. Then when Nihilanth was killed the Vortigaut race was free, but they now had to deal with the combine, who in an attempt to recover from the loss of Nihilanth and the controllers enslaved the vorts directly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My theory is that Nihilant and the controllers are the same race, and that the controllers are widely related with the Vortigaunts. Both are intelligent races that have a collective mental telepathic conection (or whatever you wanna call it) between their own species and both lived in the same planet. The Combine came to that planet (not Xen, remeber that nothing is native from Xen) to conquer those races, but they fled to Xen, however, in the end, the combine conquered them. They controlled one of the Controllers (Nihilant), modifying his body, putting him in a “slave machine” and locking him in a room from wich he can’t scape to control the rest of the controllers, whom at the same control the Vortigaunts by the bracelets you see on them (remember that near a group of Vortigaunts there’s allways a controller in Xen).</p>
<p>That means a chain of mental control:</p>
<p>Combine-----&gt;Nihilant-----&gt;Controllers-----&gt;Vorts :fffuuu:</p>
<p>The Alien Grunts are just like the Overwatch Soldiers on earth: heavily genetically modified Vortigaunts with “brainwashed minds” and deleted memories, and because of that is not necesary to control them, the same way is not necesary to repress violently and put great amounts of propaganda on the Overwatch Soldiers on earth. The main combat force of the Combine Xenian Army are the Grunts, the Vortigaunts are just used as slaves that work at the factories creating grunts, and are not intended to be a combat force, but since pretty much all Xenian living forms were teleported to earth, and the slave Vortigaunts take a defensive and violent approach against “intruders” they started to attack everyone in Black Mesa, just like all the Xenian beings</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>1 of the best theories ever made but I think that when a vortigaunt got teleported his mind was controlled directly by nihilianth, and that could explain how the F**** Nihilianth knew gordon, remember he said: ‘‘FREEEEEEEEMAN’’</p>

<p>My theory is that Nihilant and the controllers are the same race, and that the controllers are widely related with the Vortigaunts. Both are intelligent races that have a collective mental telepathic conection (or whatever you wanna call it) between their own species and both lived in the same planet. The Combine came to that planet (not Xen, remeber that nothing is native from Xen) to conquer those races, but they fled to Xen, however, in the end, the combine conquered them. They controlled one of the Controllers (Nihilant), modifying his body, putting him in a “slave machine” and locking him in a room from wich he can’t scape to control the rest of the controllers, whom at the same control the Vortigaunts by the bracelets you see on them (remember that near a group of Vortigaunts there’s allways a controller in Xen).</p>
<p>That means a chain of mental control:</p>
<p>Combine-----&gt;Nihilant-----&gt;Controllers-----&gt;Vorts :fffuuu:</p>
<p>The Alien Grunts are just like the Overwatch Soldiers on earth: heavily genetically modified Vortigaunts with “brainwashed minds” and deleted memories, and because of that is not necesary to control them, the same way is not necesary to repress violently and put great amounts of propaganda on the Overwatch Soldiers on earth. The main combat force of the Combine Xenian Army are the Grunts, the Vortigaunts are just used as slaves that work at the factories creating grunts, and are not intended to be a combat force, but since pretty much all Xenian living forms were teleported to earth, and the slave Vortigaunts take a defensive and violent approach against “intruders” they started to attack everyone in Black Mesa, just like all the Xenian beings</p>
