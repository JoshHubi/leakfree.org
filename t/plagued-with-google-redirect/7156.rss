    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/plagued-with-google-redirect/7156</link>
    <description>Yup.  Every Google search I do redirects me to one of those spam sites.  Any free (and legitimate) anti-spyware software that you guys recommend?  My university already provides Symantec Endpoint, but using its scan doesn&#39;t help.</description>

<p>Yup.  Cal Polytechnic State offers free Symantec, but I’m the only person in my class that’s strugging with redirects.  No one else I asked seemed to have it.</p>
<p>I suppose I could try formatting…but it’ll be a bitch to start over again.  Last result I suppose…</p>

            <p>If it reinstalled that junk on a reboot then the virii is still in you system memory. Last time I had a virus like that was on my old lappy vundo/virtumonde.</p>
<p>Also how are you people getting all these virii’s, pron?</p>

            <p>reinstalled upon reboot?  hm. Reformat! yeah. Yah that is what you should do.</p>
<p>But really, It sounds like some of the anti spyware sees and gets rid of it, but not completely.  Do you honestly have ANY clue as to the real culpret spyware?  Is there a pattern with where you are redirected to?</p>
<p>To ensure you have a clean host file (so that you are not redirected) you can try this:<br>
<a href="https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm</a><br>
(I use it and find it top knotch stuff)</p>
<p>Also, this might help kill any malware still going on, so that you can properly download the spyware updates, and scan.</p>

<p>Also maybe check your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">hosts file</a>, and see if it’s been tampered with.</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of what brings up these spam sites?</p>

</aside>
<p>I just searched for “miniature eyeball” (don’t ask why - random queries work better) and clicked on the result listed “<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com" rel="nofollow noopener">cgi.ebay.com</a> › … › Art Pottery › North Carolina Pottery”.</p>
<p>First this came up (click at your own risk - most possibly a virus; feel free to remove):</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.find-quick-results.com/jump1/?affiliate=ss23&amp;subid=1936_2751&amp;terms=miniature%20eyeball&amp;sid=Z176044325y8FMyYTN5EzXxMTMfdzMfdjMx8VNxYTMygTNwMTM&amp;a=ff67&amp;mr=1&amp;rc=0%5D" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.find-quick-results.com/jump1/?affiliate=ss23&amp;subid=1936_2751&amp;terms=miniature%20eyeball&amp;sid=Z176044325y8FMyYTN5EzXxMTMfdzMfdjMx8VNxYTMygTNwMTM&amp;a=ff67&amp;mr=1&amp;rc=0]</a></p>
<p>And then I was immediately redirected to this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autogrids.com/search-results.aspx?keywords=miniature+eyeball&amp;domaingroup=rehab-b&amp;referrer=adcomtq&amp;camp=0-b-hightqspread-tq-adcom&amp;group=miniature+eyeball&amp;keyword=miniature+eyeball&amp;creativeid=ss23-1936_2751" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.autogrids.com/search-results.aspx?keywords=miniature+eyeball&amp;domaingroup=rehab-b&amp;referrer=adcomtq&amp;camp=0-b-hightqspread-tq-adcom&amp;group=miniature+eyeball&amp;keyword=miniature+eyeball&amp;creativeid=ss23-1936_2751</a></p>
<p>I tried this on both IE9 and Chrome; running Malwarebytes, Superantispyware, and Symantec yielded a ton of infected files and deleted them, but apparently they reinstalled upon reboot.  D:&lt;</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

            <p>I had this a while back. Got rid of it, but my most recent PC problem is my whole computer is gaining heat somehow.</p>
<p>Stupid overheating…</p>
<p>EDIT: I think it is Conduit bar as well. Seemed to stop after I got rid of it.</p>

            <p>I don’t know… it almost sounds as if he’s talking about these bullshit sites that always appear high up in Google searches for generic / popular searches like "free download " or "fix ".<br>
If it’s the case, it has nothing to do with his machine…</p>
<p>Did you try with another browser?</p>
<p>Also, try this link (change ‘something’ to whatever you want to search):<br>
<a href="https://64.233.183.104//search?hl=en&amp;q=something" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://64.233.183.104//search?hl=en&amp;q=something</a><br>
This is <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>’s IP address, so if something is fucking up with your DNS, the results you get there should be different than your current search…</p>
<p>Also, do you get redirected AFTER clicking a result? Or do the result links themselves point to the ugly stuff?</p>

            <p>You don’t have a conduit toolbar installed do you?  I find they tend to try and control your search.  Also it sounds like the old Cool Web Search malware that was around maybe four or five years ago.  Maybe a newer replacement for that.</p>

<p>Can you give me an example of what brings up these spam sites?  “<a href="http://searchtermhere.com">searchtermhere.com</a> - Generic Slogan” sounds kind of like parking pages for un-owned domains or squatters seeking big bucks for registering a domain before another person/company can register it.  I would like to check it with my computer to see if I’m getting similar.</p>
<p>Malwarebytes, Spybot S&amp;D, Ad-Aware, running some of these anti-malware programs might also help.</p>

<p>run malwarebytes or GMER on the thing</p>
<p>(Shitmantec) Symantec endpoint being the useless piece of shit it is, will have stuff all chance of fixing it</p>
<p>Wouldn’t hurt to run hijackthis and look for anything suspicious in the log it’ll spit out either</p>

            <p>I visit Google, type any random term in, and the results listing shows up.  Usually clicking the first few results are fine, but clicking the other links redirect me.</p>
<p>They’re spam sites.  You know, sometimes it’s the obvious “searchtermhere”.com with the generic slogan, sometimes it’s free adware, sometimes it’s Careermonster.</p>

            <p>So, what, exactly, happens?  Is there a Google search toolbar in your browser window that you use and it just sends you to a spam site?  Do you type Google into the address bar and then clicking search redirects you?</p>
<p>Also, to which spam site are you being redirected?</p>

            <p>Yup.  Every Google search I do redirects me to one of those spam sites.  Any free (and legitimate) anti-spyware software that you guys recommend?  My university already provides Symantec Endpoint, but using its scan doesn’t help.</p>
