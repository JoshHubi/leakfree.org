    <title>[Crash] We&#39;ve Got Hostiles Checkpoint crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-weve-got-hostiles-checkpoint-crash/9619</link>
    <description>Before I describe what happened to make this crash, allow me to say up front: This checkpoint is a rather bad fit for this part of the map. If the player is attempting to sneak past the turrets to save on grenades or bullets, having a checkpoint right on a laser grid that trips the turrets the player just passed seems a bit unfair. 

I had a quicksave not long before this, so I loaded from there and passed the checkpoint three times due to deaths. On the third time, it crashed the game with a stutter and black as I was shot to death by turrets. No idea if the minidump records player position at the time of the crash, but it&#39;s in the ZIP folder regardless.

The map is the same map as my previous post, I believe.

            <p>Okay, just rename this thread “TURRETS AND TURRET TRIPS BREAK THE GAME.” It just crashed again at On A Rail this time, also because of turrets getting activated.<br>

            <p>It happened again, but I passed the checkpoint after turning the turrets that killed me around. It seems to be happening when the turret triggers go off- perhaps those triggers make the game unstable because of a high entity count?<br>
