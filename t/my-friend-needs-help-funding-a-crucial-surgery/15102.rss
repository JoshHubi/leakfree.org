    <title>My Friend needs help funding a crucial surgery</title>

    <description>I was originally going to put this in &quot;unofficial official chat&quot; but I figured this deserved it&#39;s own thread.

My friend Ping has had very many surgeries in her life so far.  But now, there is a major problem with the screws holding her jaw together and she needs $17,000US to get the surgery and handle any surprise overhead costs.

Ping is a dear friend of mine and I owe her a lot. When I saw Fnork&#39;s post a while back, Ping came to my aid and tried to help me track down information on her. She didn&#39;t know Fnork or anyone else from this forum but she helped anyway, because that&#39;s the kind of person Ping is. We would both greatly appreciate any possible aid. Thank you. &lt;3</description>
