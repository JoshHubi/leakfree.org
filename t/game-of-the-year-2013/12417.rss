    <title>Game of the Year 2013</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-of-the-year-2013/12417</link>
    <description>So this year a lot of promising games are coming out; Tomb Raider, The Last of Us, Watch Dogs, Bioshock Infinite, GTA V, etc etc.

I was just wondering, what do you guys think will be GOTY 2013 and what&#39;s your personal GOTY so far? Mine would probaly be Bioshock Infinite.</description>

<p>Me too. Game is up for pre-order on Amazon- decided to go for the limited ed for PC since I have a new rig that can take anything I throw at it. Like, I can get ArmA 2 running on Very High with 32fps framerate (I think Vsync is on) at 1920x1080 resolution with few dips. BioShock Infinite and Crysis are effortlessly maxed as well, all running at 60fps with the Vsync cap.</p>
<p>I love this new computer  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, it’s a bit early for all that discussion. And I haven’t played any games that came out this year yet.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to Watch Dogs the most though.</p>
