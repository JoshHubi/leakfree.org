        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Valve is estimated to be worth approximately $3 billion with Gabe Newell himself being worth an estimated $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>EA are gonna have to do WAAAY better than that.</p>

            <p>If it continues how it is, would it be that surprising that valve ended up being worth more than EA? and lets face it, valve buying EA might solve a few issues : )</p>

            <p>Well, turns out 90% of this thread is a lie. Disappointing, really. I was hoping that Valve actually gave EA the middle finger instead of just ignoring them like they usually do. One can dream, though.</p>
<p>Btw, <a class="mention" href="/u/olddirtybastard">@OldDirtyBastard</a>: I can’t stop watching your signature.</p>
