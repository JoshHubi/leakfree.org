            <p>I do. Still sad about Quake Champions. I have found memories of playing hl1dm. when servers were packed and boot camp was full. The routes you develop while running that maps, like Datacore, go for the m203 rounds, jump jets, shotgun was a 2 shell monster insta kill. Stalkyard was fav though. And how great were tripmines?!</p>
