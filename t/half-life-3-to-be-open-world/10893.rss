    <title>Half-Life 3 to be open world?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-3-to-be-open-world/10893</link>
    <description>It&#39;s a rumor,but still
&quot;The person close to Valve has confirmed that the development of Half-Life 3 is well under way, although much work remains. According to her, Half-Life 3 FPS will always be a very action-oriented, but with many RPG elements: open-world, quests and NPCs will be waiting for you! One of the inspirations the developers would also be the series of Elder Scrolls (Skyrim, Oblivion). This is very unexpected direction from Valve that we used to play rather linear but nevertheless excellent.&quot;

<p>If they actually make Half-life what3vs, I don’t see them going through with this. Maybe expanding the idea of a somewhat “open-linear” game, like at the strider battle in EP2, only expanding it to an entire game.</p>

</aside>
<p>There’s only so much you can change before you have to start from scratch. The engine was built with certain limitations in mind, such as the number of things that can be put into a map and that kind of stuff. If they could easily get rid of loading screens I would imagine they would have in Portal 2. I suppose it kind of worked in that game, with them being after every chamber but I can’t imagine it was a conscious decision to leave them in.</p>

            <p>I don’t really know how anyone would think this would be out of place anyway. Half life’s mission structure always resembled those seen in lite rpgs. Npcs telling you what to do and whatnot. The only difference would be that you get to choose what to do first. Something in the style of the darkness or even borderlands to an extent would be perfect for half life. A hub with portals that lead to relatively linear areas.</p>

            <p>I recall gaben himself saying they have something even cooler that the portal gun in store for the HL series so I don’t think we have to worry about gameplay mechanics. That was a long time ago though.</p>
<p>As for the loading screens, since they haven’t gotten rid of them by now, I think it’s safe to assume it’ll take a major engine update to do so. And by major I mean basically a new engine.</p>

            <p>Open world gameplay may not be the answer, but something has to change. A new engine using the same old gameplay mechanic will only give you more frequent, longer loading times that more often than not break immersion and that’s long been an issue with the series. I’d like to see a balance between the two.</p>
<p>I think a bunch of smaller open world areas would work, especially with the portal storyline. Besides, if we get to see Xen or other borderworlds, that would be a seperate map altogether.</p>

            <p>I highly doubt valve will go pure open world. Maybe small areas with more exploration detail, but let’s be honest half life is known for its excellent linearity, not for its weighty choices or big environments.</p>

            <p>I have suspected this for years now, so this comes as no surprise.</p>
<p>Though open world might possibly be a bit much. I’m sure it will have more than one ending and/or several ways of doing things.</p>
<p>The way valve makes stuff could turn this into such an awesomegame though. Just imagine how many hours of stuff you missed the first few playthoughs would be in the game…</p>

            <p>I think that an open world HL game could be very interesting if done right.</p>
<p>Ideally I think that it would put you in control of a new character, sometime before the events of HL2, and let you play as perhaps a resistance fighter. It could be based on stealthy travel and movement, and you have to be careful to avoid combine patrols and be sure not to lead them to a base, or it could be dynamically destroyed and any parts of the story there lost. There are a lot of interesting ideas there.</p>

<p>I could see it go with some RPG elements but not all of them.</p>
<p>An open world RPG like Skyrim would be something where you are able to choose you’re own path and become what you want to become. Since the protagonist in Half-Life is Gordon and not some unknown hero like the Dragonborn, I don’t see this coming.</p>
<p>But the ability to talk with NPCs and get quests you can do alongside the main quest for rewards that can make you stronger, I can see that. Though of course, the world can’t be as linear as Half-Life, yet it can’t be as unlinear as Skyrim either.</p>
<p>There is just one thing that makes me scratch my head now…</p>

<p>I’ve always imagined that it would be properly immersive AND properly interactive if the player could move their view up and down somewhat quickly to “nod yes” and move their view left and right somewhat quickly to “shake their head no”.</p>

<p>As for the topic at hand, I don’t really know what to think. Going all out open-world like Skyrim or whatnot doesn’t seem very appealing. It feels like it’d just detract from the story and lose focus, considering the huge change in style. However, going in a less extreme direction, similar to Crysis or such could be interesting, simply making it less corridor-y.</p>
<p>I highly doubt the information is real in the first place, though.</p>

            <p>I don’t really see that it would make all that much difference, having it open world. It’s just instead of having a long snake of levels, you have a circle or square. As for quests, well, half life pretty much had those already, just without lots of bits of text and quest screens and things. Blow up x amount of striders with magnussons. Throw the ball at dog. Defend Alyx from combines while she works on whatever machinery.</p>
<p>My only concern would be how they put it together. If they do it right, it could work. Quests should have some impact on the story. It becomes a bit difficult when the player can choose which one to do. As long as they don’t have tons of stupid, meaningless quests that don’t advance the story and aren’t interesting, I’ll be happy.</p>
<p>As for the whole question over the legitimacy of the thing, well, I can’t really see why not. It all sounds fairly reasonable to me. I guess to me, it just doesn’t seem like something a troll would make up. I would expect a troll to give more meaty information, whereas this is all very general stuff and doesn’t actually tell us a huge amount. Also that fact that the article spent a lot of time talking about the reasons for delay.</p>

            <p>Oh god no… making an open-world game would be so unoriginal, and Valve likes making revolutionary games. They make fresh games that always present a completely new concept of gaming. For me it’s unimaginable to have a non linear half-life. It just seems wrong.</p>

            <p>I have a gut feeling thats just not on Valve’s mind right now. It’s too radical for Half Life, even for an fps.</p>

            <p>Half-Life was designed to be a linear game.<br>
An open-world Half-Life game wouldn’t be Half-Life anymore.</p>
<p>Gordon, I say, was always the guy who does all the work in one-two days, going through different places and back, fighting all kinds of enemies, thinking smart on his way, caring lots of weapons at the same time, <span class="bbcode-b">all without eating, drinking and sleeping</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I always thought that the Tram / train at the beginning of HL 1 &amp; 2 was a very deliberate metaphor for Gordon’s predicament; He is being rail-roaded. He’s a driving force in the narrative, but he’s not steering it.</p>
<p>But in Ep. 2 when (possible spoilers) the G-Man agrees to let Freeman go free as long as he sees Alyx to the white forest to deliver a message to Eli, there is no railroad sequence just a (moderately) open ended vehicle section.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s an extremely interesting observation.  Another thing is is at the beginning of HL 1 &amp; 2 you’re on the tram/train, and at the<br>
beginning of Ep 2 the train has crashed. And I agree with your whole post  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m not worried at all with whatever they’re planning for the next one, when they came out with Portal 2, not only did they meet my<br>
expectations of the game but they faaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrr exceeded it and I’ve not been disappointed yet.  So I figure the chances are<br>
that whatever they chose to do with it they’ll probably do it extremely well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
