    <title>Ice Texture - HL2 Hammer Editor</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ice-texture-hl2-hammer-editor/8220</link>
    <description>Well it&#39;s my first post, so if i&#39;m writing this in the wrong section sorry  :slight_smile: 

If not wooo... anyhow i&#39;ve been designing this level all week and its a snow based map for a zombie mod and i have tried to use the preset textures and if i&#39;m honest they look a bit dated now, so i wanted to make a ice texture with bits of water dribbling down it as if the ice were melting, does anybody have a clue as to how i could make this?

I was thinking of this route but not sure how i could make little dribbles ([url]https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Creating_a_Waterfall_Material[/url])

Any help would be brill.

btw, I wrote the tutorial you linked and I’m pretty sure it’s not possible that way, shaders in source have some nasty limitations in some cases(especially refract and water shaders).</p>

<p>Well it worked  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  so maybe you didn’t play test it enough?</p>

            <p>Yeah i’m pretty sure you can do it the way that’s in the tut; I think i might have used that for something once too… it might have been something else though</p>

            <p>The only idea i’d have would be using something like the glass distort filter in photoshop over a base image, or some filter that gives it a water-y feel.</p>

<p>Personally, i’d do two separate textures and have one standard snow/ice texture beneath a second texture like the one you mentioned, and just use the second texture to refract the bottom one to give it that dripping ice effect. It’s probably not the best way, but it’d probably work.</p>

<p>Yo i’ve figured it out I put the same post on the steam forums luckily didn’t get hacked in the process however somebody told be to do what you just said  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> … it looks a bit shitty at the moment seams as the water is black blobbs and they’re running far to fast but its getting there, thanks for the reply anyhow… any chance you know how i could make the water blobs? XD</p>

            <p>…it’s the wrong forum.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I would try asking this question over at <a href="http://interlopers.net" rel="nofollow noopener">interlopers.net</a>, or another such website that’s dedicated to HL2 modding, rather than here.  That’s not to say that there’s nobody here who could help you, but you’d have a better chance elsewhere.</p>
