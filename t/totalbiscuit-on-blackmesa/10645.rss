            <p>I didn’t realise it until I finished the game, but I read on some forums that apparently <span class="bbcode-b">all </span>red valves are useable. Any other colour is not. Is that true?</p>

            <p>I was thinking that, they should have made it so you can’t crouch the fire in that part.</p>
<p>Though I thought it was pretty stupid when he said the red valve looked like everything else and there was millions of objects on the floor when A. There was only 2, and B. He already had used 3 or 4 of the same red valves and they were the only valves that did anything so far.</p>

<p>yeah but thats where level desing comes to play. As an example, you remmeber those red valves in nova-prospetk that extinguished fires? those were place in a way that, you first saw the fire, then the valve ( when you back tracked to look for another path). That partic ular part of the level could have been improved, but that would have required the fire to be unavoidable and/or the valve placed somewhere else.</p>

            <p>I have to admit that sometimes, it’s really frustrating to see other people complain about stuff they do not know a thing of, and if they do that in public, it’s frustrating to the point where it’s really annoying. But thats why TBs channel works. He is not afraid of fanboys, even if they are right in what they’re saying.</p>
<p>About platforming: It’s one reason why I like Half-Life. As a child, I loved all the jump and run games, and to some extent, I have never lost that love! I mean, is it realistic or the most intelligent way to deal with a situation? Probably not. Can it be entertaining and demanding (movement control)? I really think so. Hence, I appreciate the dev’s approach to platforming, meaning that they have not cut it out in its entirety.</p>

            <p>he didnt blamed the mod, the blamed Half life, and said specificly “half life is not a perfect game, no matter what fanbois say”, and he is right (to an extend), his dead on plataforming were ridicculus, yes, somebody who had played at least one source game knows what crouch jumping is. But the critic goes beyond that, first person plataforming is a faulty concept, witch ussually gives more headache than satisfaction. Personally I enjoy jumping puzzles, maybe because I they have grown on my thanks to the half life saga, but I can see why he thinks they are bad.</p>

<p>I also posted about how he whined throughout the livestream about how he didn’t want to put Black Mesa on YouTube because all the HL fanboys would be bitching at him… and then what does he do, he puts in on there anyway… in a horribly edited and pointlessly censored format.</p>

            <p>I watched that stream live, and I can say that TB made some pretty good points in it. Granted, it was infuriating when he didn’t figure out how to crouch jump until the chat intervened, but still.</p>
<p>Basically, I think it’s what Langenscheiss said. If you hate a game as well, he’s the best guy ever, but if you disagree, he’s a lying PoS.</p>
<p>(Gotta agree with him on the crowbar thing, though. Really? How did that get messed up?)</p>

            <p>If he rants about a game one does not like either, one realizes how smart he is. If he complains about stuff you like, he is a whining douche.

<p>Oh he definitely is, but he also has very good points and usually backs every opinion he makes with evidence (im talking about Mailbox and WTF is). In this stream, however, good points are mixed with whining. You wouldnt denied that first person plataforming was a bad idea and thats why no games apart from mirros edge have it anymore, or how the corwbar animation is way worse than the original Hl2 animation, the rest is just whining for his personal  retardation on the game and exagerating for comedy pruposes</p>

            <p>Yeah, used to like the guy.<br>
Well, still do, but himself flipping out during that stream was weird as fuck to me. He doesn’t do that too often.</p>

            <p>TotalBiscuit is such a douche. Watch out if you want to post a comment on that video… I and a bunch of other people got blocked because our feedback was slightly negative. I used to be a fan, but lately I’ve come to realize how much of a whiny tool he is. Unsubscribing from him as soon as the Terraria series ends, the only reason I watch that is for Jesse Cox.</p>
