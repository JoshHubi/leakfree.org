    <title>Getting stuck in pipes</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/getting-stuck-in-pipes/14972</link>
    <description>I&#39;m playing Black Mesa on Linux, bought through Steam.

A few times in the game so far I&#39;ve gotten stuck in pipes. The worst ones seem to be where roundish pipes go around a curve.

The first couple of times, on earlier levels, I managed to eventually wiggle through, with combinations of hitting jump and crouch and movements, but it was a painful experience.

Last night, on the Residue Processing chapter, I got totally stuck in the curved pipe heading back into the facility near the start of the level. I had to reload and try again, and got just as stuck the second time. I had to switch on noclip to get past it.</description>
