    <title>Is there any way to recover saves?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-any-way-to-recover-saves/62848</link>
    <description>I was trying to do The new achievement, &quot;The Rarest Specimen&quot; I saved and started up a new game, but accidentally I quicksaved too much and my progress with the hat is gone, it doesn&#39;t show up in the &quot;Load game&quot; menu. So, is there any way to bring those saves back?</description>

            <p>You could check if an older save is still present in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage" rel="nofollow noopener">Steam Cloud</a>, where you can download it:</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorageapp/?appid=362890" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorageapp/?appid=362890</a></p>
<p>If Black Mesa is still running, don’t quit it yet, or the older saves will likely be deleted/overwritten in Steam Cloud.</p>
<p>This only applies if Steam Cloud synchronization is enabled for Black Mesa (which is it usually is unless you disabled it.)</p>

<p>Please ignore any other variations of this method as they will not work, and rip off my original Facepunch post.  I do not recommend using this method unless you are impatient, an achievement hunter</p>
