    <title>Memorable Moments in Black Mesa?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/memorable-moments-in-black-mesa/10965</link>
    <description>Do you have any particular moments that you like, and think they are memorable to you? I sure have some.

- The Questionable Ethics lobby battle, simply because of the action, and the uplifting battle music, the correlation between the two go together really well.  :slight_smile: 

- The first time you ever pick up the Hivehand. I love it because of how Freeman reacts to sticking his hand up the little gun&#39;s bumhole.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>First play through and the coolest part for me was getting the Tau Cannon then turning on the big laser that blasts through the wall leaving hot slag on the wall. That was a visually epic scene IMHO.</p>
<p>Also, the first reactor scene before the proverbial hits the fan and the reactor at the end. So much detail and mechanical design compared to the original “floating random stuff”</p>
<p>Great mod! Need MOAR!</p>

            <p>At the moment, I would have to say the scene in Questionable Ethics after you save the scientists from the surgical unit and you take them (the group!) to the lobby (running with the scientists was kind of awesome in its own right) only to be ambushed in the lobby with the scientists screaming to you and remarking about what they’re hearing.</p>
<p>Then, after the firefight in the lobby, the scientists come out and remark about what they see.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, it still gives me chills at how awesome that entire sequence was.</p>

<p>BM version of QE far surpasses the original version in every way.  The team did a fantastic job with that section.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Shooting glock as fast as hell<br>
The Office Complex Office where the Vorts shows up<br>
Kill enemies with a hacked turret<br>
Look at the oblivious security guard getting dragged by a zombie in “We’ve Got Hostile”<br>
Shoot HECU Marines (I kinda miss em at LC)<br>
The ambush in QE : The music,the grunts,the fall (grunts are in top of the building,i love watching them fall and splat bloods on the floor),and the Scientist rage (TALK TO US DAMMIT.)<br>
Grabbing gibs.<br>
Watching brain rolling.<br>
Watching eyeballs rolling.<br>
Enters the Lambda Labs.<br>
Meet a security guard named Hunter.</p>

            <p>I spent the entire tram ride grinning like an idiot and getting chills up my spine. I was looking at all of the details put everywhere, thinking “Oh man, it’s finally here, and it’s already AWESOME. I can’t wait to see the rest!”.</p>
<p>Also, the end of Questionable Ethics of course. That was my favorite part of the game. It felt like the perfect collaboration of dialogue, music, and gameplay.</p>

            <p>I’m in the second run through Black Mesa, meanwhile I have seen Inbound so many times via Youtube …</p>
<p>I love this moment when the music begins to drum, the tram door opens and you can see how this beautiful yellow robot appears behind the slow opened door from sec E and than moves in. No matter how often I see Inbound, I keep getting goosebumps and moist eyes.</p>
<p>This is in so many ways epic. Really great job, love this. :’)</p>

            <p>Questionable Ethics is now my favourite chapter in the game. The colour scheme and atmosphere reminds me a bit of MedSci or Hydroponics from System Shock 2.</p>
<p>The ambush at the end wasn’t all that difficult for me. I was bracing myself for ragequitting because of the comments I had read about it, and then I played it for myself finally and ended up clearing it on my 3rd attempt or so, simply by taking a defence point by the door where you enter the lobby, and take out the soldiers as they run into your view. I had to lower the music volume down to like 30% to make this part bearable, though.</p>

<p>My first thought was that it’s based on airboat puzzle with blue barrels in HL2 where you need to lift some wooden logs to create a ramp. But, just like in HL, it can be skipped by exiting the train before it falls and just jumping to the other side of water tank.</p>

<p>That part was so “HOLY SHIT”, but I just wish that feeling extended to the actual fight, but due to the glitch that makes the garg fall in love with the water tower, it became underwhelming.</p>
<p>Still though, I was afraid they wouldn’t have the scene where the vent gets riddled with holes but I think having the garg there made it better then the original version  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, that’s very well paced. I was like “I’ll just drop to a room below with some soldiers” and then I saw a garg smashing through the door and I’m like “HOLY SHIT” and I run for my life - that was actually the most hectic little moment in the whole game on my 1st playthrough  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I really love all the Surface Tension chapter. With the AI adjusted, obviously. That level is long and epic. It’s an all out war between<br>
Xen and the HECU. So many things happen…and the soundtrack…<br>
Good lord…</p>

            <p>The moment in Blast Pit where you have to pass the tentacles one last time to get upstairs and burn it. With that epic music kicking in the moment you enter the room.</p>
<p>The second gargantua you run from, you look behind you and see it rushing towards you, crushing cars like they’re cardboard boxes.</p>
<p>Pretty much all the moments with the soundtrack kicking in really. Joel Nielsen really nailed it. I’d even go as far to say I prefer his work over that of Kelly Bailey. He retains the style of the original, whilst adding his own touch. Love that it’s more rock-oriented, too.</p>

            <p>The Resonance Cascade sequence at the end of Anomalous Materials was really, really nice compared to the original version. All the giant machinery and things going around you definitely makes you feel that you are part of something big and the disaster that follows is even bigger than all the machinery and test chamber that precedes it.</p>
<p>I was kind of sad when I killed my first Vortiguant by the way. I remember them as allies from HL 2. Also I was kind of afraid of them too, because they were very tough in HL2 but then I remembered this is HL 1 and they are merely slaves here.</p>
<p>Ah and also, it was really nice to see Eli Vance and Doctor Kleiner.</p>

            <p>1.) The hivehand pickup scene<br>
2.) Jets flying by in surface tension plus the airstrike<br>
3.) The ambush in questionable ethics<br>
4.) Both the assasin fights<br>
5.) The manta ray vs. jets scene<br>
6.) Popping out of all the little holes in surface tension while fighting a tank and dozens<br>
of HECU grunts guerillia style  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
7.) Seeing the new Garguanta the first time in power up<br>
8.) pretty much the whole game</p>
