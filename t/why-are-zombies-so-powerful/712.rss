    <title>why are zombies so powerful?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-are-zombies-so-powerful/712</link>
    <description>On difficult( in half life 1), zombies deal 40hp damage when they hit you with both claws. but garguantuas deal 30hp damage when they smack you. meaning that zombies can do more damage than garguantuas melee wise. I suppose they do so much damage because its almost impossible to get hit by them if you try to dodge,but the only real way you can ever be hit by a garg is on purpose, because to get with melee range means you have to pass threw their fire attack, which would deal quite a bit of damage. So because it so hard to get hit by them, they may as well remove the attack or make it somewhat more threatening in BMS, but that&#39;s just my opinion. but still, WHY do zombies do more melee damage than gargs? :hmph:</description>

            <p>Well if the zombies were to weak people would complain and to strong they’d complaine. So valve just left them in between same with the gargantuan.</p>

            <p>Why are you complaining about zombie swipes? At least they are mutated. Was I the only one startled by the strength of Marine kicks? Those took a huge chunk outta my health. (I DID play my first playthrough on hard, but it’s not THAT much of a difference.)</p>

            <p>Posting once, then instead of using the edit button you just post a second time.</p>
<p>Pretaining to the subject, if they hit you twice, wouldn’t that mean that one claw attack delt 20 points of damage?</p>

<p>You have point, but still…an arm the size of yours and arm the size of you…what would logically do more damage? IMO, the garg. plus, wouldn’t it hands be REALLY hot because of the intense heat it stores within itself? I does think the outside is hot, because if it was the HEV suit would register fire damage and touching the garg would result in damage. but do to the fact he was wearing an HEV suit, I guess it might make sense for lacerations to be worse than blunt melee damage. plus, when you get hit by both hands from a zombie the suit says ‘<span class="bbcode-b">MAJOR</span> lacerations detected’ but when the garg hits you it just says ‘<span class="bbcode-b">MINOR</span> fracture detected’<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
