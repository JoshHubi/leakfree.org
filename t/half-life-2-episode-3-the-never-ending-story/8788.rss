    <title>Half Life 2 Episode 3- The Never Ending Story</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-2-episode-3-the-never-ending-story/8788</link>
    <description>The time between the episodes being released has been something of a hot topic, or it was before the world got bored and moved onto other things.
Obviously it&#39;s the irony that releasing episodes quicker was to make the release faster that has us marvel at Valve&#39;s situation. 

And I think it&#39;s a safe bet that Episode 3 will never be released.

Looking at it objectively, we see a game that was slow to release from the very beginning, and while it was award winning and fantastic I can&#39;t help but wonder if Valve dragged their feet for a reason. Like a kid who just doesn&#39;t wanna do the damn dishes(!), Valve only really wants to produce multiplayer games. They declared their intent to only produce multiplayer not long ago, whether this discluded Ep. 3 from production is something to wonder about.

Left 4 Dead and it&#39;s very quickly released sequel were produced so fluently because though it has singleplayer, the ultimate attraction was the multiplayer. And let&#39;s face it; had the effort that was put into Left 4 Dead 2 been put into Half Life 3 (and I mean without the episodes, the actual game as a whole) then the game would have been released LONG ago. And Left 4 Dead 2 was release ONE YEAR after it&#39;s prequel. 

Episode 3 could have been released Long ago, but it hasn&#39;t. And there is a reason for said delay. Valve dragged their feet for too long and, just like that kid who doesn&#39;t wanna wash up, they&#39;re still sitting in the sink while he&#39;s off doing something else. 
Valve doesn&#39;t feel obliged to complete their game series, they&#39;ve moved on. And whenever they&#39;re pressed, the questions are dodged with little effort. Just move on, next topic please. 

If the gaming community were to group together and SOMEHOW get Valve to promise to finish (by finish... I mean START) Episode 3, then who would buy it? Sure there are PC gamers on steam, but it won&#39;t be a midnight line up like mainstream games. It&#39;ll be people buying the game as a sort of &#39;what the hell, let&#39;s see how that old series ends&#39;. 

***
So all together, consider the points that are holding up production of Ep. 3. Valve&#39;s lack of enthusiasm; the time that has elapsed and the lack of a market that the game now offers.

Episode 3 won&#39;t sell as well as it would have, especially when you consider that it&#39;ll probably NEVER be seen on XBOX or Playstation.

Worth mentioning is that Episode 3&#39;s plot won&#39;t be resolved logically. Can you think of a logical way to explain the G-man&#39;s plot that wouldn&#39;t leave people disappointed or insulted. Telling the player that the g-man is apart of Gordon&#39;s subconscious and not actually real, would be like ME3&#39;s ending (and we all know how that went down).


Shall we forget about Episode 3? I think so. The sooner the better because, well... Ep. 3 just isn&#39;t coming. Though Valve won&#39;t admit it (because they like to keep you on the hook) Ep. 3&#39;s production hasn&#39;t even been started. 


***
In closing. The momentum of the Half Life 3 series has died like a marathon runner with a broken shin. Half Life 2 Episode 3; the Never Ending Story.</description>

            <p>I know right? So many people know so much shit. It’s amazing that they haven’t just up and put together the games themselves with how much concrete knowledge they have on the subject.</p>

            <p>The assumption that the allocation (or percieved lack thereof) of rescources to a project automatically means said project will be completed in a more timely fashion and be a better game for it is count to potato retarded… Some things just should not be rushed, and Half Life 3 is one of them… Personally, I want this new installment to evolve fps and gaming as much and hit just as hard as the last 2 did, and therefore i dont give a flying fuck if it takes them another 7 years to make, as long as its that good…</p>

            <p>Valve doesn’t “drag their feet.” Working at Valve isn’t high school where you can dick around on your phone all day and no one says anything. They don’t care what you work on, but you have to deliver RESULTS, even if those results don’t reach the public and end up being re-worked or scrapped during iteration.</p>
<p>Different games have different development periods. Valve has traditionally struggled with defining and executing the HL and Team Fortress series, while they have had little trouble with games like CS, Dota, L4D, and Portal. It’s just the nature of the kinds of things the games are trying to do. HL needs to be revolutionary, and after two solid (but slightly rehashed) episodes, I think they probably realized that they need Half-Life to be a nuclear bomb again, like it was the first two times.</p>
<p>Gabe said Valve has been working on “Ricochet 2” this whole time, and it makes sense that he’s correct. It’s just hard to make a third game in a series have the same impact as the first two, when the first two were industry-defining masterpieces. It takes time.</p>
<p>People should research Half-Life 2 before making these threads. These exact same discussions were popping up all over the place pre-HL2 release. “No one will care about Half-Life any more. Everyone just wants to play Halo.”</p>
<p>And then Half-Life 2 sold 6 million copies in its first year. Half-Life 3 will come out, be good, and do fine.</p>

            <p>What is the point of making a new thread just to post a paragraph that basically boils down to “Well, <em>I</em> think that [noparse]HL2:E3[/noparse] will never come out!!1!”? Regardless of whether you scream “Opinion!” or not, there’s so much saying that you’re wrong. HL is Valve’s flagship game, and they’re not going to stop releasing games for it with no announcement whatsoever. The last game also ended on an extremely large cliffhanger, which again, makes it really obvious that they’re eventually going to continue the story, as long as they stay in business. No matter how long the game takes to release it will release.</p>

            <p>Lol…<br>
That’s all I’m gonna bother saying.</p>
<p>PS: why post a new thread about it? They’re loads out there which could have loved been commented on. They haven’t been for such a long time, and you…<br>
You ruin their dream of being commented on by creating a new thread. Do you even have the slightest idea how much you hurt these old threads?<br>
Some haven’t been commented on for years, and yet you create a new one.<br>
I’d feel ashamed if I were you.</p>

            <p>Uh, I wouldn’t be calling this comment trolling, or call me a troll. I joined today, didn’t mean i join for to just post this thread.</p>
<p>And differing opinions make the world go round, much like religion and atheism, facism and freedom and all that jargon.</p>
<p>These are my opinions, should I’d share. You can disagree all you want, that’s what makes freedom of speech such a great thing.</p>
<p>And when the day comes that HL3 is released (or the episode) then I will gladly kiss your feet and tell you how right you were and how wrong I was. But… I wouldn’t hold my breath.</p>

            <p>Your point is stupid, your logic doesn’t make sense, and we already have a million episode 3 threads, this will be closed fast. Anyway episode 3 is in development and it has already been stated that it will be singleplayer plus, meaning it will have co-op or a multiplayer mode of some sort. Can’t believe you joined today just to post this thread you troll.</p>

            <p>The time between the episodes being released has been something of a hot topic, or it was before the world got bored and moved onto other things.<br>
Obviously it’s the irony that releasing episodes quicker was to make the release faster that has us marvel at Valve’s situation.</p>
<p>And I think it’s a safe bet that Episode 3 will never be released.</p>
<p>Looking at it objectively, we see a game that was slow to release from the very beginning, and while it was award winning and fantastic I can’t help but wonder if Valve dragged their feet for a reason. Like a kid who just doesn’t wanna do the damn dishes(!), Valve only really wants to produce multiplayer games. They declared their intent to only produce multiplayer not long ago, whether this discluded Ep. 3 from production is something to wonder about.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead and it’s very quickly released sequel were produced so fluently because though it has singleplayer, the ultimate attraction was the multiplayer. And let’s face it; had the effort that was put into Left 4 Dead 2 been put into Half Life 3 (and I mean without the episodes, the actual game as a whole) then the game would have been released LONG ago. And Left 4 Dead 2 was release ONE YEAR after it’s prequel.</p>
<p>Episode 3 could have been released Long ago, but it hasn’t. And there is a reason for said delay. Valve dragged their feet for too long and, just like that kid who doesn’t wanna wash up, they’re still sitting in the sink while he’s off doing something else.<br>
Valve doesn’t feel obliged to complete their game series, they’ve moved on. And whenever they’re pressed, the questions are dodged with little effort. Just move on, next topic please.</p>
<p>If the gaming community were to group together and SOMEHOW get Valve to promise to finish (by finish… I mean START) Episode 3, then who would buy it? Sure there are PC gamers on steam, but it won’t be a midnight line up like mainstream games. It’ll be people buying the game as a sort of ‘what the hell, let’s see how that old series ends’.</p>
<hr>
<p>So all together, consider the points that are holding up production of Ep. 3. Valve’s lack of enthusiasm; the time that has elapsed and the lack of a market that the game now offers.</p>
<p>Episode 3 won’t sell as well as it would have, especially when you consider that it’ll probably NEVER be seen on XBOX or Playstation.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning is that Episode 3’s plot won’t be resolved logically. Can you think of a logical way to explain the G-man’s plot that wouldn’t leave people disappointed or insulted. Telling the player that the g-man is apart of Gordon’s subconscious and not actually real, would be like ME3’s ending (and we all know how that went down).</p>
<p>Shall we forget about Episode 3? I think so. The sooner the better because, well… Ep. 3 just isn’t coming. Though Valve won’t admit it (because they like to keep you on the hook) Ep. 3’s production hasn’t even been started.</p>
<hr>
<p>In closing. The momentum of the Half Life 3 series has died like a marathon runner with a broken shin. Half Life 2 Episode 3; the Never Ending Story.</p>
