    <title>I Will Probably Be Moving To Florida In October</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-will-probably-be-moving-to-florida-in-october/15247</link>
    <description>I had a job interview this evening, and it went well. I got an offer to start when they get moved into their new office. I will be making about the same money I am making now, and they will even help me get set up in a new place.


Yay!  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I learned Autocad in high school. I did figure a lot of stuff out on my own though. I have done any 3d work since 2014 unfortunately.</p>
<p>As to why not California? I’m an east coast guy, Florida is less expensive, and has better air from what I have heard. Also, I have been there before and know the area a little.</p>

            <p>Great! I’m glad things are shaping up in a way you want them to! It’s a great feeling when that happens, tho I get the “I’m terrified!” - my wife and I kinda decided today to move to brasil by the beginning of next year, so I will have this moment, too, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>I’d like to ask you something about the work you do. You are working in an architectural firm, aren’t you? What is it that you do there? I believe I remeber you mentioning 3D visualisations. Is that still true? If so, what programs are you using? And did you learn those by yourself?</p>
<p>Anyway, best of luck for your future life down south!</p>
<p>(One more question: Why did you favor Florida in stead of - say - California?)</p>

            <p>I measured a bank in Boca back in 2014.</p>
<p>I need to put together a list of things I need to buy when I get there…</p>

            <p>Left out a few other important things. Jai Lai is huge in Florida and it seemed like they have more golf courses there we  posts in our threads!<br>
Check out Boca Raton, I thought it was absolutely gorgeous. I had no idea that you could go to a dog track and play poker.</p>

            <p>Palm Beach county. The office is in Del Ray now, but moving next month a town or two up north.</p>
<p>I have been to a dog track in 2014 to play poker. Didn’t watch and races. And I don’t gamble or play cards anymore…</p>
<p>And I also hate seafood.</p>

            <p>Where at in Florida?<br>
The best part about Florida are the dog tracks, the worst things about Florida are the lightning, the sink holes and that Scientology is headquartered there.<br>
P.S. Got great seafood though…</p>
