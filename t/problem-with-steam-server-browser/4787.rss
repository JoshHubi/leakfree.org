    <title>Problem with steam server browser</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-steam-server-browser/4787</link>
    <description>Since the big engine updates I only find about 100-200 servers for each game, and all of them seem to be from my country.
I also can&#39;t join friends when they are ingame anymore.
It all worked perfectly before the updates.

Don&#39;t say anything like &quot;open ports&quot; or &quot;disable firewall&quot;, I tried that.</description>

            <p>give it time, send error report if possible, i had similar problems in the past, and solved it by uninstalling steam and reinstalling, you could try that, but backup all your shizzle so you dont lose enay!</p>
