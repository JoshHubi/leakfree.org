    <title>Bullying</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bullying/6459</link>
    <description>I just saw a segment on the news where 7 teenagers were taping their bullying of a 13 year old for 20 minutes. Dispite his cries for help, no one stepped up. Not even the woman that walked around the mob as seen in the recording.

So at what point would the police deem it ok for me to put my hands on a kid to pull him off another kid?  Last I heard, if I so much as touch another kid, I can get arrested.  My own child was a daily victim of bullying until I followed him home one time till they started in on him again, and I cussed out the mob.

Fair? Just? Do it anyway? Call cops while watching? Do nothing?

Who of you HAVE been in a situation where you saw the bullying and knew it was wrong? What did you do? Were YOU a victim?</description>

<blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of my Junior year in High School, actually.  Rather funny incident witnessed between classes.</p>
<p>So, there was this commotion in the hall.  There was this little stick-thin skate-punk kid, about 5’ 0", 110lbs, soaking wet, hassling this other guy.  Apparently he had run off with skate-punk’s girlfriend, or he’d dinged his car, or skate-punk was just looking for a fight.  Never did quite figure out the cause.  He’s doing the usual ‘tough guy’ routine.  He’s jumping around waving his arms, trying to get up in the other guy’s face, and spouting off a stream of obscenities and ‘gangsta’ talk, that was rather laughable coming from a blonde white guy.</p>
<p>Eventually Skate-Punk gets annoyed that his ‘victim’ just seems to be wandering down the hall ignoring him…So, he throws a punch.</p>
<p>He throws a punch at a guy at least a foot taller, and twice his weight, who just happened to be on the wrestling team.  A half-second later, skate-punk is literally flying across the hall to impact quite painfully on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>Funniest damned thing I ever saw…</p>
<p>But seriously.  Dealt with bullies.  Fuck 'em.  Faculty and ‘authority figures’ never did a goddamn thing.  Good on Casey.  I hate to say it, but a lot of the time, giving them a taste of their own is the only way to get it to stop.</p>

<p>That made me laugh so hard… In my School district there is no such thing as bullying, no one does it, but hey at least there have been kids cought smoking weed. There was this one kid though in 7th grade that kept calling people faggots, gaylords, and prostitutes, he would also threaten to snap your neck; I would constatnly annoy him every time he’d threaten me. those were such fun times</p>

<p>In my class at school, there was a big fat guy that was bullied quite often. He could easily defend himself, but he didn’t.</p>

            <p>I don’t think the school I went to had much of a bullying problem, or at least I never saw any. There were plenty of fights, though.</p>

            <p>My time in school was hell on earth.</p>
<p>Bullying is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> the kind of crap anyone should put up with. Regardless of what school administrators say about fighting being “everyone’s fault,” self defense is not a crime.</p>

            <p>In my school the only bullies were the group of pathetic people who acted all tough and say they’re smarter than other people, meanwhile not paying attention in class and failing their exams.
