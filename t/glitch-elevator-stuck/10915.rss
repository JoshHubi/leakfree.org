    <title>[Glitch] Elevator stuck</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glitch-elevator-stuck/10915</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t remember which chapter this is.  There&#39;s a part where you get into an elevator, it stops and drops you into radioactive sludge.  When the elevator dropped me, I landed in the sludge and lost some health.  After that, I some how managed to get stuck underneath the sludge.  I was forced to load a save point.
