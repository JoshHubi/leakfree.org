    <title>Secondary functions for weapons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/secondary-functions-for-weapons/3821</link>
    <description>I have read that some of the weapons have been stripped of second functionality, like the Glock for instance.

I just came on the forums so I haven&#39;t seen these types of posts but I was wondering if you could add some of these secondary functions for the weapons.

The crow bar can gave a hard swing using when pressing the secondary trigger.
- Pros: Powerful
- Cons: Has a slow recovery time, I guess recoil?
Yes it&#39;s lightweight but think about it. Swing a ruler right now, lightly and hardly. Which one hurts more?

I was wondering if the zoom in feature will be available for the .357 Magnum. I just edited the wiki and added that it was an original feature in the trivia section. I wasn&#39;t sure if you the team has stripped it and has already made it final which was why I didn&#39;t add it in the secondary function. Yes guys, it is in Half life source. Try it now. Magnum zoom rules.  :smiley:  It is not just in the Deathmatch but also in singleplayer.

The pistol or glock, ..... Gun straightening and centering.

As seen in this vid.
Maybe the magnum can have this? Also the SMG but freaking grenade thing has taken it. -_-
&quot;&quot;&quot;EDIT&quot;&quot;&quot;
What happens if a post is red. Does that mean it sucks?</description>

<p>The only weapons that need the secondary function are the mp5, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, and tau cannon.</p>
<p>The other weapons do not require alternate functions because they are unnecessary.</p>

<p>Doesn’t the .357 also have a secondary zoom feature for Single Player and Multiplayer?</p>
