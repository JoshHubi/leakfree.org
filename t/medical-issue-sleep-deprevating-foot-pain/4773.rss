    <title>Medical Issue - Sleep Deprevating foot pain</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/medical-issue-sleep-deprevating-foot-pain/4773</link>
    <description>I slipped into a friends hot tub the other day. Landed on my right foot once on the seat and again on the bottom very hard but no significant pain. A few hours ago I was playing manhunt with friends and running a lot and took another semi hard hit this time. No pain started then either. About 2 hours ago the serious pain set in. I can&#39;t put any pressure on it without experiencing serious pain. Even while not under pressure it hurts horribly and is keeping me up (6am). I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not broken but that I have a serious bone bruise? Any other thoughts? I&#39;m headed for x-rays in a few hours and am occupying myself to attempt at shutting out the pain.</description>

<p>Not exactly a fair comparison. For the small crap here, they charge too much.<br>
Sure you had lack of service but in a major incident like that here. They would<br>
drug you up, do all this crap and slap you with a bill probably twice than what it<br>
should be and say insurance wont cover it.</p>
<p>Not to mention, it wasn’t as bad as your condition to absolutely see one right<br>
away.</p>
<p>On a lighter note. Glad you’re alright. [/SIZE]</p>

            <p>Even if it’s just a sprained ankle, it can get really bad if not treated badly. Last time I sprained mine it kept hurting for almost two years, until eventually I got some physiotherapy.</p>

            <p>I’d reccomend putting on an elastic foot support thingy and then see a doctor if it doesn’t go away.  Also, try to walk as normally as possible, it tends to help.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>To better answer your question, where did you actually impact your foot in the hot tub?  And then how was it damaged playing manhunt?  Finally, where actually are you experiencing pain?  The ankle, the arch, your heel, etc.</p>
<p>My mom had something similar happen a few summers ago, jumped into a pool with her legs locked and landed square on her right heel in 3 feet of water.  Got an X-ray, actually had a piece of bone chip off, caused her a world of hurt.</p>
<p>Doctors may suck, but it’s worth getting checked out - if something sheared/cracked and it heals wrong, you’ll regret not having it checked out.  And if they recommend it, do whatever therapy they recommend!  It sometimes seems silly, but those exercises only take a few minutes and definitely help recovery.</p>

            <p>I had a similar thing last summer. I crashed with my bike on a dirt jump and landed on my wrist. It didn’t seem to hurt much, so I continued riding for a couple of hours more. When I got home it started hurting while I was eating supper (at about 11pm :p) and when I went to bed the real pain started. No matter how I tried I couldn’t position my wrist so that it wouldn’t hurt really bad. Couldn’t sleep for the most of the night. The next morning it wouldn’t hurt unless I moved it… for a single degree. I couldn’t ride my bike for a couple of weeks while it gradually got better.</p>
