    <title>Windows 7: Need permission from my own account</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-need-permission-from-my-own-account/7292</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just reinstalled Windows 7, and I&#39;m trying to delete some old shit.
I took ownership and gave myself full permissions, but when I try to delete it, it&#39;s telling me I need permission from [i]my own account[/i]. Wtf?

Any thoughts?

edit: 
these commands in cmd work:
takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y
icacls &lt;foldername&gt; /grant administrators:F /T


pretty fucked up that you even need to do that though :|</description>
