    <title>The fate and possible survival of Dr. Breen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-fate-and-possible-survival-of-dr-breen/4603</link>
    <description>So what happened to Breen?

I personally believe he was transferred into an advisor&#39;s body. Think about what happens in the EP1 advisor room; a video in which Breen specifically mentions, and agrees to, being put into a host body. (the devs had to have put it there for a reason) Then an advisor appears, is apparently afraid to let Gordon and Alyx see him, and launches an unprovoked mental attack. Futhermore, when you meet that same advisor again in EP2, (he&#39;s the Barn guy) he is apparently inexperienced with his advisor abilities.

It just makes sense to me, but I could very well be wrong, and that&#39;s what this thread is for. Proving me wrong.</description>

            <p>In my opinion; the only chance for Dr. Breen to return is in a Flashback.</p>
<p>That’s what Valve said.<br>
Anyways, i THINK so.<br>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>about breen: we know that the combine were beginning to become annoyed with him for not producing results, so that could mean they did not go to any extra lengths to protect him. we have no proof that he did or did not die. there is good evidence supporting both outcomes, it really depends on what valve decides to do. we also <span class="bbcode-i">think</span> that he may have a host body ready for him, and that we have no idea what that body could be, or if they had resorted to a different tactic. there were also reasons for is face flashing across the screen when the gman mentions that some people (breen) did not approve of keeping alyx alive. about the breencast where he is seen that i believe everyone is referring to, why wouldn’t the combine be playing breencasts that were prerecorded? (i mean, would he seriously show all of them live? and apparently not because after a certain amount of time they begin to loop) it doesn’t mean he is alive or dead.</p>
<p>about the advisors: we really don’t know enough about them to draw any major conclusions. the main theories are that a:they all work together, linked telepathically, so they don’t have a single leader, which could mean they are the combine. b:they are a species conquered by the combine. c:they are either low ranking officials or high ranking warriors of the combine, also saying they are part of the original species. or d:they answer to one king-like figure, similar to the nialanth.</p>
<p>regarding the combine: they either are here for our resources, or they want control of more planets. and some people have said that it is strange that humans (a technologically inferior race) have discovered inter-spatial teleportation before the combine, but the combine probably had access to different resources than we did. this also may support that the advisors are not combine (coming from a different environment and hence not being able to breath or something to that angle). we really don’t know if the combine are under control of something worse.</p>
<p>so in the end, i think you really need to just take a guess and see if that is the way it turns out.</p>

<p>I’ve never heard that. It’s intriguing.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>How could one man have slipped through your force’s fingers time and time again? How is it possible? This is not some agent provocateur or highly trained assassin we are discussing. Gordon Freeman is a theoretical physicist who had hardly earned the distinction of his Ph.D. at the time of the Black Mesa Incident. <span class="bbcode-u">I have good reason to believe that in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>EDIT: misunderstood what you meant.<br>
Of course they can’t say you need me without their mind, but that doesn’t mean the mind can’t be copied.</p>
<p>Either way, saying that there’s no way he could survive the fall is silly. He was on a platform. Just because you broke the top of the thing doesn’t mean that it had to drop like a stone. There are various fail safes that are available to ensure a survivable descent even without power, so there’s no reason to think there wasn’t one present in this case to ensure he survived to the bottom, allowing him to run from the room to a bunker of some sort so he didn’t die in the explosion.</p>

<p>He is too, making a sarcastic point to extending the logic to all other characters no matter how inapplicable it is. I’d actually agree with this if I could remember ANY of those characters making an appearance after they were supposed to have died.</p>

<p>Knowing who Breen is wasn’t exactly important for knowing what was going on in Episode 1. It’s not like he was ever really mentioned by anyone after that scene, and the only thing before it was when he was seen on the monitor. In the intro.</p>

<p>I’m not actually sure that was intentional. It’s a static texture that was used for Breencasts in HL2 and they could have just used it there so they didn’t have to make a whole new texture.</p>

            <p>Unless that shield around him some how saved him from the huge explosion and or falling damage i would say hes pretty dead. Also he sounded like he knew he was screwed imo.</p>
<p>Edit: its true that he seems to be mentioned over and over in different ways, i thought this was just for nostalgia or something. but yea i guess it could also be building to a re-appearance</p>

            <p>Well, it could be to fill in the gaps about who breen is for those who haven’t played HL2. Sure most people who own Ep1 should have already played HL2, but not everyone does. Well written stories have ways of bringing those details back up so that players just coming into the storyline on the second book aren’t left completely out of the loop.</p>
<p>But yeah, I still feel that there is a specific significance to his reappearance, and some of it might have just been intended to keep that option open, even if they ended up not using the idea of bringing him back.</p>

<p>You disappoint me. Do people have to always explain everything to you? It’s implied.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was under the assumption that it was the combine who need stopping, not their powerless figurehead.</p>
<p>Let’s stop and think for a minute about that host-body message. First they go through the effort of having Breen in that scene, rather than just having him go strait to the teleport. Than later in the citadel in Episode 1, go through the effort of showing that exact same scene <span class="bbcode-i">again</span>. If it wasn’t going to amount to anything, why would they go through the effort of showing you twice?</p>
