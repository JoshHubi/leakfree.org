    <description>First time running the game, I go into the video options and enable anti aliasing. After applying the screen goes black but I still hear audio. Verified game cache, uninstalled/reinstalled, still the same.</description>

            <p>I’m running it on a laptop, and it’s got two GPU’s, and I don’t know the difference between the two. The first is an AMD Radeon HD 7730M driver version 8.951.9.1000. The second is an Intel® HD Graphics 4000, same driver version.</p>
<p>I couldn’t say, I wanted to play with the graphics settings, so I set anti-aliasing to the highest (x8 I believe) and that’s when it happened.</p>

            <p>Could you post your computer’s specifications? GPU and driver version would be quite helpful.</p>
<p>Does this happen for all anti-aliasing settings or just the high ones? What resolution are you running the game? Does your GPU driver override anti-aliasing?</p>
