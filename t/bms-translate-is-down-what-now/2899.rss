    <title>BMS Translate is down, what now?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-translate-is-down-what-now/2899</link>
    <description>So the original forum of Black Mesa Translate is down [url=https://bmtranslate.forumsplace.com/index.php]Link here[/url] and I was wondering, did you found a new site already because it&#39;s hard to contact any of those guys because I don&#39;t know there names on this forum as well as there steam ID&#39;s.

We knew that BMTranslate would go down so we did already saved most of the translations, don&#39;t worry about that.



....FAQ: Yes that website is down for ever and no they will not put it back online anymore.</description>

<p>Even intelligent people tend to go through the phase in their lives when they think “Why can’t everybody just learn English and let’s drop all other languages”.</p>
<p>Even people who are perfect in English would have trouble understanding Mossman when she talked about “Tau-Yamaho” (I personally heard “tau-yau model” the first time around) or when Kleiner mentioned “orbifold, Hilbert-inclusive”.</p>
<p>Then you have the group of hearing-impaired people, who can’t do without subtitles.</p>
<p>People just don’t have anything better to do now, they feel malnutritioned with information (or lack thereof), so they poke into totally minor areas of the mod, trying to find something good to kill time.</p>

<p>Well, besides the bit where Landa investigates LaPadite’s farm. Although it served the plot really well it was a bit of a deus ex machina moment, most of the cinema laughed out loud when Colonel Landa asked if they could switch to English.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well yeah, but it’s not like they were speaking English in the movie while they were supposed to be speaking German in reality, like they do in many movies.</p>

            <p>Yes.</p>
<p>I understand english perfectly well, and I enjoy video game immersion, but I ALWAYS turn on FULL subtitles. That includes in-game SFX, speech, etc. I can’t stand missing a word of dialogue, and it makes the experience seem more cinematic for me.</p>

            <p>I guess you do have a point, but still, as I said this is more of a service for people who don’t know English/simply prefer subtitles. As simple as that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Now, I’ve put <a href="https://bmtranslate.darkbb.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> together.

<p>And Hubicorn - “forumplace” went down because they didn’t had enough money to keep it up also they had a lot of spammers (also a problem on BMStranslate).</p>

<p>It’s more realistic in English anyway. The game takes place in an English speaking country, everyone speaks English, just take in the whole experience as if you are “immersed” in this English-speaking environment. Subtitles ruin immersion so just roll with it IMHO.</p>

<p>Subtitles doesn’t ruin much the immersion. DUBBING DOES.</p>

            <p>If you don’t know English, it is more realistic that you wouldn’t understand dialogue English-speaking characters were saying, isn’t it not?</p>

            <p>I know, I personally don’t like translations, but there are people who simply don’t know the language, or they don’t like it, even. It’s more of a service for them, I think  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It’s more realistic in English anyway. The game takes place in an English speaking country, everyone speaks English, just take in the whole experience as if you are “immersed” in this English-speaking environment. Subtitles ruin immersion so just roll with it IMHO.</p>

            <p>Well, I’m honestly not sure. Vidanor has been kinda MIA, so perhaps I’ll look for a place somewhere to create a new forum. I didn’t see much progress during the time the other forum was up though, but I’m hoping things are gonna work out now that we’re getting close to the release date (or are we?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>But yeah, I’ll look around for a place, if Vidanor doesn’t beat me to it.</p>

            <p>So the original forum of Black Mesa Translate is down <a href="https://bmtranslate.forumsplace.com/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link here</a> and I was wondering, did you found a new site already because it’s hard to contact any of those guys because I don’t know there names on this forum as well as there steam ID’s.</p>
<p>We knew that BMTranslate would go down so we did already saved most of the translations, don’t worry about that.</p>
<p>…FAQ: Yes that website is down for ever and no they will not put it back online anymore.</p>
