    <title>Blackmesa.7z-Download issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blackmesa-7z-download-issues/11701</link>
    <description>Hey Guys,
I&#39;ve problems with the download of blackmesa.7z (Yes, I tried on ALL mirrors), because when i have downloaded it 7-zip just say &quot;C:\\Downloads\blackmesa.7z can&#39;t be opened as an archive.&quot; (I had to translate it because my 7-zip is german) And I don&#39;t want to download the file again from all mirrors, because my internet is very slow. Can someone help me? (Yeah, my english is also bad.)


P.S: Can I download the archive in Parts? My Computer needs for the complete data more than 10 hours (because my internet = slow) And this is very annoying when I have to wait untill it&#39;s finished...:&#39;(</description>
