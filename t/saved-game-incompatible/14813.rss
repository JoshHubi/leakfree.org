    <title>Saved Game Incompatible</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/saved-game-incompatible/14813</link>
    <description>When I try to load a saved game I get the error: Outdated save is incompatible with current version of the game.  Please restart the chapter from the &quot;New Game&quot; menu.

I thought save files were backwards compatible.  Is there a way I can update the save file so I can use it?

Thanks</description>

            <p>No, there isn’t any way to update the save file.</p>
<p>Sometimes nothing bad will happen, with smaller updates, but they are usually incompatible with huge updates like the last CU, because they change a lot of things, and will inevitably create a number of issues, rendering the save game into a total mess.</p>
<p>You’ll have to restart the chapter you were last on.</p>

            <p>The reason for that message is because whenever there’s an update for Source Engine games like Black Mesa, it tends to lead to weird bugs if you try to use an old save.  In one big update about a year ago, if you tried to load an old save, you would have zombie hands (which you are only supposed to see in MP if you choose to play as one). Starting over the chapter would fix that.</p>
