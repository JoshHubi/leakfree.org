    <title>Flight simulators - flying high</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flight-simulators-flying-high/4417</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I just falled into aircraft simulators again. Really long time ago I played Retaliator, TFX, F22ADF and I think EF2000 was the last one (with Metallica &quot;Black album&quot; in cd-rom bay)  :slight_smile: 
Long time passed and I buyed now Wings of Prey. I simply love it and indeed I&#39;m looking up for Falcon Red Viper etc. or FSX with some jet fighter addons.
I watched some [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILqgM1onMmI][b]video tutorials[/b][/url] and it really takes me in seriously.
When I handle basics and rules with that beauty old planes (without all that crazy electronics) I&#39;d like to move on to Falcon and buy 
[url=https://www.gadgetreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/logitech-g940-flight-system-1-580x386.jpg][b]this beauty[/b][/url].

Is there some flight simulator crazy maniacs who can give any basic advices? I mean where I can start to search and what I can start to learn first. I don&#39;t ask for explanations here. Just any links will be very appreciated.

Thanks in advance</description>

<p>Its how they taught us to fly in the cadets, and its good practise. But remember, each plane is pretty different. I was impressed with the realism of IL2, but it didn’t improve my skills much (good approach, undercarriage down, undercarriage has fell off, maybe I won’t land just yet…)</p>

            <p>First of all thanks a lot for your response.</p>
<p>I’d like stick probalby rather with military aircrafts only. I mean behind my monitor of course  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Civilian aircrafts (FS-X) would be great in case I will want learn to fly in real some day. But when I realized I am not even able to learn all that abbreviation and pass exams in english…</p>
<p>But FS-X tutorials sounds very useful if they are done well. I think it maight introduce me into things such as take of and landing procedures and proper understanding of all that basic elements and instruments. Thanks for a good tip. Good to know I dont need to pass absolutely everything up to civilian flighting and move on to military simulator tutorials. At least I know where I can start to learn and where to move on later ;o)</p>
<p>Falcon 4 with Red Viper or Open Falcon addons looks realy juicy but I think I will start with Lock On as you suggested. I found comprehensive guide in my native language right now so I think start there will be good decision. I just fall in love into that Logitech device and it feels too much good (and expensive) to play only Wings of prey (which is bscly IL2-sturmovnik I think)</p>
<p>But let’s be honest. When BMS will comes out, that device will end in corner for a long time anyway ;o)</p>

            <p>Well, do you want to fly military or civilian aircraft? There are different jumping-off points for each, because each has their own simulation software (Microsoft’s flight sim is geared towards civilian aviation, other games like Lock-On or IL2 are geared towards military aviation) - the catch is that most military fighter games don’t put a heavy emphasis on aircraft systems, and aspects of aviation like navigation - they’re not necessarily accessible to players or necessary for the game, so they’re omitted in favor of other features. There are some upcoming games that should fit into that niche, but until then, you kind of have to pick sides…</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the aviation side of things, I strongly suggest getting a copy of Microsoft Flight Sim 2004/X (depending on what your computer can handle) and learning the basics there - instrument and visual navigation, maneuvers, takeoffs, landings, (simulated) radio communication, and instrument approaches. It’s easier to practice all of these in MSFS which has a more relaxed flying environment, than another game which drops you into a combat scenario where people are also shooting at you when you’re trying to learn.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the combat/gaming side of things more, I suggest getting a copy of Lock-On, printing out the manual/control reference, and flying through their tutorials until you get the hang of things…they explain maneuvering and how to fly the aircraft and use the systems extremely well.</p>
<p>If you have any specific aviation questions, feel free to ask - I’ve been flying simulators for years and have a number of hours in the air as well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for positive reply ;o)</p>
<p>Motor glider sounds good. Some day I want participate some basic course and try at least glider (must be beautifle).</p>
<p>I can handle aircrafts from Wings of Prey on simulation mode well. Basic maneuvres are not a problem. I know I must reduce mixture at high altitude or add some when engine is cold before take off and such things. I even landed (barely stopped at end of the runway)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   Hunt other planes is (are*) not a problem. (*damn) I’m sometimes surprised myself what is possible to do. But sometimes when I am hunted and try loose the bastard from my tail I spin into stall easily. That’s why I want at the first place practice with not complicated aircrafts before I’ll buy such a expensive device and go on into modern jet fighters.</p>
<p>It’s more about that I want take it seriously and go deep f.e. into Falcon 4. And there is a lot of knowledge. Of course I can google tutorials, manuals, flying basics etc. But it is realy hard catch up to something at the begining and some experienced virtual pilot could give some advices.<br>
Like go to this page and learn this basics. Then you can try start to understand F16 and here you can find a lot of useful info. You need to know everything about radio comunication, navigation, ILS (if you want land in deep fog) etc. so here you can find everything about it.</p>
<p>So this thread is probably allready dead but maybe someone will help and share his knowledge a little.</p>

            <p>Ignore it, your English is probably better than mine  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I used to play a lot of IL2 Sturmovik, and found that if you understand the basic ins and outs of how a plane works it becomes much easier to grasp how to fly them</p>
<p>I got the hang of landing after learning to fly a motor glider with the cadets, but it won’t be much help unless you’re flying a plane with a tail wheel  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I just falled into aircraft simulators again. Really long time ago I played Retaliator, TFX, F22ADF and I think EF2000 was the last one (with Metallica “Black album” in cd-rom bay)  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Long time passed and I buyed now Wings of Prey. I simply love it and indeed I’m looking up for Falcon Red Viper etc. or FSX with some jet fighter addons.<br>
I watched some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILqgM1onMmI" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">video tutorials</span></a> and it really takes me in seriously.<br>
When I handle basics and rules with that beauty old planes (without all that crazy electronics) I’d like to move on to Falcon and buy<br>
<a href="https://www.gadgetreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/logitech-g940-flight-system-1-580x386.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">this beauty</span></a>.</p>
<p>Is there some flight simulator crazy maniacs who can give any basic advices? I mean where I can start to search and what I can start to learn first. I don’t ask for explanations here. Just any links will be very appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
