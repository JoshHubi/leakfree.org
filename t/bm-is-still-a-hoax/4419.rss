    <title>BM is still a hoax</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-is-still-a-hoax/4419</link>
    <description>When I ask the devs to prove this mod even exists they give us this (and stuff like this): [url]https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackMesaSourceMedia#p/u/0/wuJ1siA-Yq8[/url]

Ohh yea, proof positive!! Phht, give me a break. After six years this is the best proof you can come up with that this mod ever made it out of the conceptual stage. Yea right! Hell, I could probably make that if i played with the dev software for a couple days.

I think the &quot;demo trailer&quot; was someones job interview portfolio project. Simply to show off some skills, nothing more.

Hey Dev&#39;s: &quot;prove me wrong!&quot;

Here is a thought, why dont you show a video of an actual level!!

Sorry for the rant but hey I THINK ITS A HOAX!!</description>
