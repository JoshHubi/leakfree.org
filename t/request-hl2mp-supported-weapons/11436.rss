    <title>[REQUEST] HL2MP Supported Weapons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/request-hl2mp-supported-weapons/11436</link>
    <description>Hey guys alright so one day i thought that the BMS weapons was good enough for me to use in HL2 Multiplayer games like deathmatch etc So... I was trying to copy the weapons from the mod onto deathmatch to see if it worked i was surprised it worked when i played alone but once i joined a server it dissapointed me... Glitching animations so i was wondering if anyone could make these weapon models compatible with HL2MP games because i really like these models and animations greatly but it just dissapoints me at the point i see the animations doesnt work properly ive already tried to see what i could do to fix it but it didnt work of course... My model ended up glitching up COMPLETLY like the 357 barrel flying around and such
But it would be much appreciated if you guys could make this possible! Thanks  :slight_smile:

<p>The first one you can’t do on any <span class="bbcode-i">public</span> server because all the variables server-side won’t work properly (they don’t exist) you would need to start your own server with the proper files in place.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes at first i was just trying to put them in and replace all possible models including hand models the animations were glitchy but they seemed fine enough after spending some time using them<br>
And i did already know i had to host my own server with the models for it to work</p>

<p>I did already know that models cant just be replaced with their file name and i wasnt really trying to use satchel or gluon because… What weapons would be suitable in HL2 for those two?</p>
