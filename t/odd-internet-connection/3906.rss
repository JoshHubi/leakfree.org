    <title>Odd Internet Connection</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/odd-internet-connection/3906</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know exactly how to word this without making absolutely no sense, but Ill do my best, because this is driving me crazy! 

Basically I have 3 computers on a network (Charter 20mb connection) that all properly establish internet connections. The weird part is that one of my computers, which was just reinstalled to windows 7, drops internet connection at random points while the other two computers stay connected. The only way to restore internet is to disable/re-enable my connection in the control panel, or restart the computer. Remember, the other two computers internet work just fine, even if this one isn&#39;t.  

I &quot;score&quot; very high on speed tests, and can game fine. It generally happens when I try to download something, the size and download rate don&#39;t seem to effect anything. For example, I am currently downloading L4D2 on my computer and while I am writing this my internet died. The computer next to me, which is on the same network, still has internet. 

This problem is starting to annoy me, as it is happening very frequently now. If anyone has any ideas, please help me out.</description>

<p>According to you, you have a problem in network connection in you new installed PC. So check it first and check all the static IP address. If there is no IP address then do it first. There is only possibility that your IP address might be changed and you can’t be connected anymore.</p>

            <p>Sounds like IP addresses interfering to me. Make sure your Win7 computer isn’t using a static one.</p>

            <p>I think it’s just a hardware problem, or a problem of the drivers of said hardware.</p>

            <p>It probably has nothing to do with your internet connection, seeing as the other two computers work fine. I would say that it’s a problem with that particular computer that you are using. Do you have the proper Win7 drivers for your NIC / wireless card?</p>

            <p>We would have to know more information about how you have your network set up.</p>
<p>Do you have any Static IPs?<br>
Was this happening before you installed Win7?</p>
<p>It’s probably a piece of software, driver, or interference between two of them.</p>
