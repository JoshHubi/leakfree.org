            <p>The devs have already stated that they’re not going to add co-op mode, it would require changing every map to accommodate multiple players, which is far too much work, especially now that the mod has been released. There’s also the balancing issues that come with having more than one player, and having to deal with players dieing properly.</p>

            <p>Even if developers will make a co-op modification for this game, it won’t happen any time soon, since the game itself is not fully completed yet.</p>
