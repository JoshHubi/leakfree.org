    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-good-is-my-protection/1769</link>
    <description>Okay what i&#39;m trying to ask is how good is the protection level on my PC. From a level of 1-10. I use Spyware Doctor for my antivirus and spyware application. I use Windows Vista Firewall. And for my browser I use Mozilla Firefox 3.5, with these extensions, Wot,Adblock,Better Privacy, and Noscript. Also what programs should I get rid of and which ones should I have, my PC is a gaming PC.</description>

            <p>Usually, if your computer is running shitty, its for a few reasons, Viruses(which usually are in your temp files), Problems with registry, having multiple anti-viruses, being retarded on the internet. CCleaner fixes registry problems and and clear ure computer of shitty files including temp files. And if your going to look for porn, atleast find a “safe” way of finding it. Usually, a community wont allow people to share viruses, so find a forum or something, yea, do that. I’ve had this computer for errrrrr, 6 months, I use no spyware, malware protection, and my firewall is usually down so i can host servers on games, and my computer still runs just as quickly as it did when I first got it, maybe a tiny bit slower, but not noticable. I use CCleaner to remove temp files and fix reg. files, and I don’t go to porn sites where you can get 5 bazilion viruses. If your worried about getting viruses, your probly not thinking right when ure downloading music/porn/movies. Just think before u go to specific sites and u would be fine. Oh and Mozilla is also extremely helpful</p>

            <p>A couple of years ago my kid clicked something he wasnt supposed to.  A pop up that said “DO you want to protect yourself from VIRUSES!??!!”  yes/no</p>
<p>Yeah, I wasnt in the house at the time so of course by an hour later my computer was so hosed I could barely maneuver around.</p>
<p>Anyway, I figured this was my chance to actually TEST what exactly the different programs would find now that I KNEW I was infected with spyware/malware/ickies</p>
<p>Adaware: found 94 issues<br>
Spybot: found 120 issues<br>
Malwarebites: found 4 issues<br>
AVG: found 200 something issues</p>
<p>Now, I dont know how much of that was duplicates or false positives, but in my mind, malwarebites sucks.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve heard good reviews on AVG and Avast, I’ve never really heard much about spyware doctor. You could look up comparisons, but I stick with Kaspersky because their customer support is awesome, they will do a remote diagnosis for free and email you a script to remove any viruses that Kaspersky can’t detect like PAV, all for free. The reason don’t update kaspersky to block PAV is because it is a very flexible virus like the flu, and they’re alway changing it.</p>

            <p>i’m pretty sure i have some kind of virus. i’ve been getting shitloads of bluescreens and for different reasons, my computer keeps losing steam.exe somehow (win32 error) i don’t know what it means. kaspersky scans come up fine, but it did the same thing when I had pav (personal anivirus(a virus)) on my pc. I just cant identify it. The way i see it, with all the useless shit on my pc, I might as well just wipe the hard drive and reinstall everything. If someone knows how to do that plz help. I’m sad to say that there is just no way i’ll be able to DL bms on its release.</p>
<p>Edit: Did a Kaspersky scan and found two win32 fraud packages made by (guess who) Personal Antivirus. Damn russians viruses.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>AVG gives you protection of pretty much everything including spyware and all that jazz as well as link checkers for your browser.</p>
<p>Also, you’re overreacting about this. Most programs these days detect viruses, malware and spyware all in one big thing. Get a package that watches all of them. If you get more then one program they can interfere with each other and screw up your protection.</p>

            <p>Don’t worry, a mod will soon come and delete your post for posting innuendo…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I use Norton because my brother had an extra install left. And Firefox. Though the real protection is Common Sense 2008</p>

            <p>Overall I think your protection is adequate: Now there is absolutely no chance you will ever get a woman pregnant.</p>
<p>Sorry, I went there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just a small clarification; that wasn’t a personal attack, it was made in good fun and I hope you don’t take it personally, because it certainly wasn’t meant that way.</p>
<p>Oh, and something about viagra.</p>

<p>^This.</p>
<p>However, if you are intent on getting more protection, <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> pay for it. Go with Avira/AVG for free virus protection and ZoneAlarm or the basic Windows one for a firewall. For spyware, look at Spybot; its an old favourite of mine.</p>

            <p>In addition to knowing what I’m doing, avoiding IE etc, always having a firewall up, and being behind a NAT router, I also periodically run Secunia PSI, which tells me when something I have installed has a security-related update, thereby helping me avoid having any virus-friendly compromisable software.<br>
For most people, the M$ Security Essentials + windows firewall (unless you like keeping track of exit traffic too), NAT router, and generally keeping things updated (hence Secunia) is plenty, tho knowing not to open dodgy emails helps too (but things like using gmail with it’s great spam filter helps a lot there too).</p>
