    <description>Is this project still alive? I was shown this site by my son a very logn time ago and i was excited, I loved the mystery of Black Mesa and I liked the graphics (but not the locations/gameplay) of half life 2 so to have something that brought two of the things together was awesome.

But ive not really heard any more, has this project died a death or is it alive and kicking and is so... any ETA (i know that is a question we are not supposed to ask)</description>

            <p>thanks for posting people, I must admit I have not visited here much lately as it seemed dead to me, only hope kept the bookmark in my favourites… from the screen shots i’ve seen it looks awesome.</p>

<p>The dev team is still alive and kicking, the game is mostly done, just bug fixes and balancing issues.  Supposedly they’ve been doing this for about a year, maybe more.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree. The mod is very much alive. There just “polishing it” and letting friends and family play test it before release.</p>

<p>Yep, this project is dead. It’s no use looking around the forums at all because there’s definitely no evidence anywhere that this mod is still alive.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Definitely. Directly creating a thread asking if the mod is dead without any previous research is by far the smartest thing anyone can do.</p>
