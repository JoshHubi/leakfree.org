hi there, about 3 years ago i bought a logitech x530 5.1ch. 
About a week ago the front left speaker just decided it doesnt want to work at all. I immediately thought the speaker had died. I dropped it so many times so i wasnt too suprised. I swapped the front left and the back right speakers around and the front left speaker worked fine.
This suggests the front left port on the sub is at fault. I plugged the speakers into my spare computer to see if it was the onboard soundcard failing. The front left speaker still didnt work.

I looked up some guides to disassembling the sub and i hear there is an unbelievable amount of glue used in this thing, so taking it apart myself isnt really an option. 

Anyone have any ideas?</description>

            <p>It might not be a short. It might be that the female connector might have gotten “loose”. I’m assuming that the connectors are RCA types. I have a Logitech speaker system but not the model you have. It’s not something that happens very often, but it’s not unheard of. You might want to check the male connector as well. Also is the board where all the connections are screwed into the sub? If so there might not be as much glue and you would be able to see if it might be something else, such as poor soldering of the wire to the female connector (thus the wire falling off - this is very rare). Those are the easiest things I could think of for the moment. If you still don’t want to open up the sub I could suggest checking e-bay if anyone is selling one for cheap. Although you’re never sure what shape it might actually be in until you get it.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you may have a short somewhere. Aside from opening it up and separate the wires that are shorting you don’t have a lot of options</p>
