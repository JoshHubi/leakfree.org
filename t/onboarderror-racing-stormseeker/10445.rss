    <description>Not [i]really[/i] racing, but the developer behind the last overhaul of Inbound and Anomalous Materials (probably more sorry) is trying to beat Stormseeker&#39;s (the developer behind Surface Tension notably) Black Mesa speedrun record of 3hrs and 22mins.

Go [url=&#39;https://www.twitch.tv/bms_onboarderror&#39;]here[/url] to see the TwitchTV feed.

It&#39;s also a BMS Steam Group Community event. Go [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/groups/BlackMesa#events/1658705200375240104&#39;]here[/url] to see it.

(Sorry this post is late so those who didn&#39;t already know have missed a lot.)

Edit: I guess OBE did some of Surface Tension too so IDK.

Edit2: It&#39;s over, he&#39;s answering questions now, but that&#39;ll be over in a few minutes. He got 2hrs and 27 minutes.

Some answered questions:
1.There was originally gonna be a part at the end where the Controllers try to dismantle the pod the scientist is in.
2.Surface Tension had some missing parts because the developer working on some parts quit mid development.
3.The OaR maps that filled more of the original chapter were apparently cut because they were developed by a sub-par team member who left as well.

There were definately more answered questions, I just don&#39;t remember all. Please reply and add what you remember as well!

Good job OBE! It was interesting listening to your development commentary, please work on a commentary add-on! It&#39;s not boring  :slight_smile: .</description>

            <p>Would love to see another run with more dev commentary. I watched the saved stream video of this one last night and it was interesting to hear about some things you’d never know otherwise. I think you should leave some game volume on this time though, just not too loud so we can hear you like maybe 20% game volume or less.</p>
<p>Also after watching how slow your run was in some parts I retract my old statement, I think the speedruns could eventually get down to 45minutes or an hour if it was extremely asian speedy perfect run and possible people will replace the bunnyhopping with the jump pack from the start. It might not be as legit, but would be funner to watch probably.</p>

<p>I bet a ton of people would be interested in that. Be sure to put in on youtube afterwards though!<br>
Personally I’d love it if you got another dev with you on voicechat too. It’s super interesting to hear your perspective on the game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, you could totally land a job as a level designer if you wanted to.</p>

            <p>I was wondering when speedruns would start to pop up. Sad I missed watching this one. I love watching the different routes people take that you had no idea about. Without the bunnyhoping I doubt that BMS will ever get lower than an hour and half, but who knows.</p>

            <p>Just did my own speedrun, my second playthrough ever, and I got approx <span class="bbcode-b">2hrs:44mins</span> (not counting the tram or load times.) Jesus that was harder than I expected… I even had a few tricks up my sleeve that OBE didnt use and still didn’t come very close! That was really fun, but also stressful as hell. At least I still did better than Storm! hehe</p>

            <p>Could someone upload an HD version somewhere? I’d like to watch it but I can’t hear half of what he says on the stream. Also, the community would cream itself for dev commentary.</p>

            <p>Real fun tonight, nice learning about other’s experiences that we shared together.</p>
<p>Funny watching OBE fail on his own map  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Oh yeah ,and that scorch-mark bug on Lambda was kinda funny.</p>

            <p>Heh, you still managed to meet well under your goal time though, despite all of the sidetracking and headcrab-tripmine failing.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Plus thanks to that run, I learned about a whole bunch of alternate paths through the game, especially on Surface Tension. Thanks for that, and thanks for a great game in general! :3</p>

<p>That was AWESOME watching OBE hurl insults at his own game every time he died.</p>
<p>ESPECIALLY ON HIS OWN MAP. BAHAHAHHAAH that was funny as hell. Especially when that stray headcrab started walking around and triggered his death, then he went to town on the poor thing when he re-loaded. PRICELESS.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Yep many great laughs were had at OBE’s expense and we also found out a lot about the mod, the ideas behind it and some challenges during development.</p>
