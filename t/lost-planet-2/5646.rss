    <title>Lost Planet 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lost-planet-2/5646</link>
    <description>Alright, so I am seriously torn about this one. On one hand, with APB gone, I find myself really REALLY missing a good coop third person shooter. Aliens are always fun and lost planet looks like it has a bit of a UT3 feel to it. (which is, for the most part, good)

On the other hand, well... I really don&#39;t know. does it look like it&#39;s worth it/ is anyone else getting it and why/whynot?</description>

            <p>I really liked the first one. It was a great monster-slaying, explosion-filled shooter with robots, so if I had the money to spare I’d pre-order right now. Although some of the reviews are a little off-putting, so I might wait to try it some time before buying.</p>
