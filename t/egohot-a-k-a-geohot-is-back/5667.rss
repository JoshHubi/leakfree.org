    <title>Egohot (a.k.a Geohot) is back</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/egohot-a-k-a-geohot-is-back/5667</link>
    <description>As many of you may remember. I posted a thread about Geohot leaving the jailbreak scene. Now he&#39;s back, with his release of &quot;limera1n&quot; for the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad/Apple TV. Now many of you may think that this is a good thing, right? WORNG!!! The exploit that geohot&#39;s limera1n uses. Is a bootrom exploit. Meaning apple can&#39;t patch it unless they release new hardware. So that&#39;s a good that we have found another bootrom exploit, that means that all idevice&#39;s currently out, will be able to be jailbroken forever. The only problem is chronic dev team has also found a bootrom exploit. Bootrom exploits are 1 in a million to find. So here&#39;s what happened. Chronic dev team was going to release a jailbreak tool called &quot;greenpois0n&quot; which uses a different bootrom exploit called &quot;SHAtter&quot; but Geohot is also going to release limera1n which uses a different bootrom exploit called &quot;limera1n&quot;. So that mean Geohot is going to burn a perfectly good bootrom exploit, just because he wants to beat chronic dev team to the punch. He also confirmed that he only started working on limera1n after he found out that chronic dev team was going to release &quot;greenposi0n&quot; on Sunday. He&#39;s such an asshole if you ask me. So now chronic dev team is going to have to rewrite greenposi0n to use geohots exploit, or not release at all. Or they could release greenposi0n. But then they would expose the &quot;SHAtter&quot; exploit. As you can probably imagine, I&#39;m really ticked about this</description>

            <p>Downloaded it when I heard the news about Greenpois0n not supporting the 3GS and obviously limera1n also didn’t work (I have new bootrom)</p>
<p>Geohot is an idiot for releasing now instead of waiting until the greenpois0n exploit gets patched.</p>

            <p>UPDATE!!!</p>
<p>Geohot just released limera1n. Untested, and very unstable. Meaning that chronic dev will have to use the SHAtter exploit to make a stable jailbreak. So when you can’t jailbreak your iPhone 5, iPad 2, and iPod Touch 5. Remember that its all because of Geohot</p>

<p>Also Swampy the political situation in the “iDevice” community doesn’t really bother most people in the BM community, if it did, we’d already have read about it, on an “iDevice” forum.</p>

            <p>Give him a break he is just showing his distaste for Geohotz attitude towards chronic dev, i agree with you 100% Secomed, Bootrom exploits should be savoured and released one at a time. I understand the pain of having to wait ages until a new bootrom exploit is released due to me owning a iphone 3gs bootrom: 359.3.2 and having to wait until spirit jailbreak was released.</p>

</aside>
<p>Ok here’s what happened. Chronic dev team has an exploit called “SHAtter” and there implementing it, in a USB control mode jailbreaktool called “greenposi0n” but Geohot, being the way he is, wanted all the fame and glory of releasing the jailbreak first. But the only problem is, is he uses a different bootrom exploit called “limera1n” and so if chronic dev team and Geohot release there tools. Two very valuable bootrom exploits will be exposed at the same time. Meaning apple will patch both of them with in a month.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As many of you may remember. I posted a thread about Geohot leaving the jailbreak scene. Now he’s back, with his release of “limera1n” for the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad/Apple TV. Now many of you may think that this is a good thing, right? WORNG!!! The exploit that geohot’s limera1n uses. Is a bootrom exploit. Meaning apple can’t patch it unless they release new hardware. So that’s a good that we have found another bootrom exploit, that means that all idevice’s currently out, will be able to be jailbroken forever. The only problem is chronic dev team has also found a bootrom exploit. Bootrom exploits are 1 in a million to find. So here’s what happened. Chronic dev team was going to release a jailbreak tool called “greenpois0n” which uses a different bootrom exploit called “SHAtter” but Geohot is also going to release limera1n which uses a different bootrom exploit called “limera1n”. So that mean Geohot is going to burn a perfectly good bootrom exploit, just because he wants to beat chronic dev team to the punch. He also confirmed that he only started working on limera1n after he found out that chronic dev team was going to release “greenposi0n” on Sunday. He’s such an asshole if you ask me. So now chronic dev team is going to have to rewrite greenposi0n to use geohots exploit, or not release at all. Or they could release greenposi0n. But then they would expose the “SHAtter” exploit. As you can probably imagine, I’m really ticked about this</p>
