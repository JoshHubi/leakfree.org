    <title>Game Crash at the end of Office Complex (not the flash light issue)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crash-at-the-end-of-office-complex-not-the-flash-light-issue/12213</link>
    <description>Hey all! I am having an issue with Black Mesa at the end of Office Complex. Scientist is hanging from a ladder and falls, I continue to climb said ladder, elevator comes down and breaks random boards that were your former walkway, I jump into the elevator via vent, hit the load screen and bam game crash. I have tried to play with settings (shadow effects was my first try, no dice) but I have had no luck so far. Currently running Windows 7 x64.

Any help would be much appreciated!!</description>
