    <title>What part are you anxious to see in BM?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-part-are-you-anxious-to-see-in-bm/1322</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to hear what y&#39;all are anxious to see in the mod.  Is it the journey on the Inbound train?  The tentacle alien in Blast Pit?  Xen?  The Gonarch?  Nihilanth?  The Resonance Cascade?  Tootling around on a rail?

Me, personally, I really can&#39;t wait to see the first after effects of the RC.  Or perhaps playing with the map and calling in air strikes on that poor innocent blue alien guy that shoots fire out of his hands.</description>

<p>I don’t mean to alarm anyone, but you need to take everything we say with a grain of salt. Things like “Black Mesa isn’t dead”, “we’re still working on it” and “2009” might not be as grounded in the realms of reality as you’d all like.</p>

<p>I can’t help but feel that this is how the people that have been waiting since the start feel.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wk1Ym45Df8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wk1Ym45Df8</a>  Just replace Gabe’s face with your avatar.</p>
<p>O.T.  Basically all of it, since this will be the first time I play Half-Life 1 in any way.  Why spend 10 dollars for the obsolete version when you can be patient until the new and improved version is one day released for free?</p>

<p>Go through the Youtube channel, there are plenty of samples. For one thing there’s the trailer (don’t overlook the G-Man line in the middle, ‘prepare for unforeseen consequences’, that’s not taken from any Valve recordings), and for another there are several old devblog videos with outtakes and samples.</p>

            <p>Hmm, actually I’d like to see all of chapters, but the biggest hopes is for Questionable Ethics(Except for XEN, of course). I remember first time i enter that lobby - it was beauty, even for now, so…</p>

            <p>The trainride. No matter how much some people hate it, I just can’t! Its so stupidly long, and yet it still did feel good! Just sitting there, hearing the errors, seeing the fact that the facility looks like shit. What happens at the next securityinspection, I wonder… &gt;: D</p>

            <p>It may seem dumb, but I’m anxious for the actual resonance cascade.  It was just such a pivotal moment for me as a gamer.  It broke the damn mold, man!  I can’t wait to push that little cart into the stream and watch the shit hit the FAN!</p>
<p>That, and picking up the crowbar immediately after.  THAT was pivotal too!  I remember it was late August, right after that (in nineteen ninety eight) when I went to OSH, bought a crowbar, and killed that drifter.</p>
<p>Wait…shit.  Topic, guys.</p>
