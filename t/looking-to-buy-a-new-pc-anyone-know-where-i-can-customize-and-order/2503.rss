    <title>Looking to buy a new pc, anyone know where i can customize and order?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-to-buy-a-new-pc-anyone-know-where-i-can-customize-and-order/2503</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been stuck here with a Dimension E510 with a shitty single core pentium D, I wanted a quad core with a shit-big L2 cache for overclocking so I called dell and apparently I need a new computer completely.

I want the best shit so I won&#39;t have to buy for a long time. Steam linked me to alienware customization, so I customized their best pc with the best shit, a badass processor and dual graphics card capability and it came out at $6,565... bullshit. My freinds tell me alienware is a ripoff company and said I could get the same stuff way cheaper. The problem is, I cant find any sites to do this. I could just buy the parts and assemble it, but I don&#39;t know whats compatable with what.

So I was wondering if anyone at bm knows a site where you can customize and have a pc shipped... cheap, not paperclips and duct tape cheap, I mean not jacked up like alienware.</description>

<p>You’re worried about drivers? When you buy the parts, they come with CD’s and you just put the CD in, and they’re installed.</p>
<p>Why do people always bitch about drivers, 99% of the time, it’s one google search away.</p>

            <p>ibuypower does a pretty good job, two of my friends have ordered comps from them, but yeah the price is a little jacked up, but its understandable since they are also putting the computer together for u.</p>

<p>Read their customer reviews. There are tons of people online saying they recieved faulty hardware, or different hardware than they ordered, parts not installed correctly, etc.</p>

</aside>
<p>Also, take into account, if your order gets screwed up, you’re probably more likely to comment about it then if your order goes perfectly.</p>
<p>I hear ibuypower is overpriced, but I’ve never looked into it.</p>
<p>If you have a local computer store, chances are you can find the parts your want and get them to assemble it for you.</p>

            <p>HP does some pretty decent machines, but the easiest way to build a PC would be to just build one yourself, or get a friend to build it.<br>
If you’re interested, read up on how to figure out what works with what, or just ask someone. I did the same for my first PC- I figured out what I wanted, bought it, then had a friend assemble it.</p>

            <p>You idiot Alienware isn’t the only pc manufacturer in the world. Any normal computer store will do as long as you know what you want.</p>

            <p>I’ve been stuck here with a Dimension E510 with a shitty single core pentium D, I wanted a quad core with a shit-big L2 cache for overclocking so I called dell and apparently I need a new computer completely.</p>
<p>I want the best shit so I won’t have to buy for a long time. Steam linked me to alienware customization, so I customized their best pc with the best shit, a badass processor and dual graphics card capability and it came out at $6,565… bullshit. My freinds tell me alienware is a ripoff company and said I could get the same stuff way cheaper. The problem is, I cant find any sites to do this. I could just buy the parts and assemble it, but I don’t know whats compatable with what.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if anyone at bm knows a site where you can customize and have a pc shipped… cheap, not paperclips and duct tape cheap, I mean not jacked up like alienware.</p>
