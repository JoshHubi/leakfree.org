            <p>I would estimate a power level of over 9000. I mean player level. Yeah.</p>
<p>Seriously though, it should be a fair amount of players and it will continue to grow as people hear about it.</p>
<p>The trailer got massive attention on digg. My guess is if we can get the launch announcement spread through social media sites like that we can exponentially increase the amount of people interested.</p>

            <p>Counter Stike, Team Fortress and Day of Defeat are multiplayer games, they where purchased because they where deemed as essential by Multiplayer gamers. Its something that can be continuously sold, continuously updated and continuously played.</p>
<p>Now while that isn’t a jab at Black Mesa in any form, it isn’t the Single Player game of the re-created Half-Life that would be a basis of Valves interest<span class="bbcode-b">*</span>… now if the Multiplayer component is just as well crafted, fun and exciting that im hoping the single player to be then there would be foundation to speculate as much.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">*</span>Valve of course are interested in the Single Player, but they’re also interested in keeping fans and community happy also.</p>

<p>Kidding aside, what I wanted to say was that you’re probably going to release both modes bundled, so the initial release would ‘ship’ with either both MP modes or none at all.</p>

            <p>If I’m interpreting the recent statements of the devs correctly, the code base of the multiplayer and singleplayer parts are being developed seperately, so I guess if they’ll bundle co-op and deathmatch. That’s a wild guess, though.</p>

            <p>Uh, let’s get back on topic. I’m guessing Co-op probably won’t make it into the release, but what about the state of deathmatch? Is that still scheduled to be included?</p>
