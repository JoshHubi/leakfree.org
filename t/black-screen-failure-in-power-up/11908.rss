    <title>Black screen failure in Power Up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-screen-failure-in-power-up/11908</link>
    <description>The screen goes black when I try to go past the room where the explosive barrels kill all the Vortigaunts (just before you open the door and climb the ladders in the toxic waste silo within the Power Up chapter). 

However, though the screen goes black, the audio&#39;s still working and the HUD is still visible. Basically, everything but the 3D models and textures still works, but other than the HUD, the screen remains black.

This is what I&#39;ve tried:

-mat_specular [0,1]
-mem_force_flush [0,1] 
-mat_fullbright [0,1]
-mat_hsv [0,1] 
-mat_softwarelighting [0,1]
-flush
-noclip (camera still fails, no matter where I re-enter the map after the door I mentioned earlier)
-restart (which worked as far as I did the level again and didn&#39;t have the problem until I tried to save it, then I came back with the blank screen right from loading, even though I didn&#39;t save on one. I also tried no-clipping to the end after restart. Didn&#39;t fix it.)
-Reinstalling
-Redownloading
-Updated my graphics card (Intel Q965/Q963 Express Chipset Family)

It seems that even though I can get past this error, eventually the black screen of death returns by the next save&#39;s load.

My friend and I have been playing the hell out of Black Mesa and it&#39;s easily the best HL game in the franchise, so let us know what the issue is here so we can finish the damn thing!

PS: I found the pizza.</description>

<p>your directx in the backup folder solution worked like a charm. If I wasn’t broke, I’d pay you. You deserve some recognition, and I hope the developers do just that.</p>
<p>you’re like 10 kinds of great dude. Thanks!</p>

<p>Forum search could be your friend. Back in the days the game had been released I had been investigating this bug and had come to a conclusion that with older GPUs like Radeon 9500 (i.e. pre-SM2.0 DX9 hardware) or with some crappy Intel “integrated GPUs” the game fails to render fullscreen noise shader properly resulting in totally black screen. Due to a bug in the game engine (in BMS game server dlls, not in Source engine itself) is it impossible to disable noise shader using console variable - it seems that it is simply ignored by the game. But it was possible to kind-a workaround the problem by messing up with a game shader dlls and definition files. I can’t recall exact details now but you could try reading this thread for a possible solution:<br>

<p>Do you have any ideas yet in terms of solving this glitch?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Could you add “<span class="bbcode-b">-dev -condebug</span>” (without the quite marks) to the Black Mesa launch options in steam. (Right click the BM icon in <span class="bbcode-b">steam &gt; properties &gt; set launch options</span>)</p>
<p>If you then run the game and play the area in question that is causing your screen to go black it will generate a log file of the console.</p>
<p>The file will generate to <span class="bbcode-b">\SourceMods\BMS\console.log</span>, this can be opened in notepad or any other text reader. Could you then upload that log file somewhere and link it here so I can have a look.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>No. That specific section of Power Up that I referenced earlier in the thread is the only part where I’ve experience this glitch. I’ve had to stop playing now because it’s persistent. I tried it yesterday, and the same thing happened.  It won’t let up. The screen keeps going black.</p>

</aside>
<p>Are you sure this is the issue?</p>
<p>I’ve already come across toxic waste in the game multiple times to get up to the point where it’s malfunctioning, so why would it be a problem in this area of the game in particular?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Your Intel onboard graphic card obviously can’t handle the shader used by Black Mesa in the toxic waste part.<br>
You should get a decent GPU for your PC. Even if you can turn down lots of settings for Source Engine games to run on onboard graphic, it’s not recommended for Black Mesa since many bugs will come with it.</p>

            <p>The screen goes black when I try to go past the room where the explosive barrels kill all the Vortigaunts (just before you open the door and climb the ladders in the toxic waste silo within the Power Up chapter).</p>
<p>However, though the screen goes black, the audio’s still working and the HUD is still visible. Basically, everything but the 3D models and textures still works, but other than the HUD, the screen remains black.</p>
<p>This is what I’ve tried:</p>
<p>-mat_specular [0,1]<br>
-mem_force_flush [0,1]<br>
-mat_fullbright [0,1]<br>
-mat_hsv [0,1]<br>
-mat_softwarelighting [0,1]<br>
-flush<br>
-noclip (camera still fails, no matter where I re-enter the map after the door I mentioned earlier)<br>
-restart (which worked as far as I did the level again and didn’t have the problem until I tried to save it, then I came back with the blank screen right from loading, even though I didn’t save on one. I also tried no-clipping to the end after restart. Didn’t fix it.)<br>
-Reinstalling<br>
-Redownloading<br>
-Updated my graphics card (Intel Q965/Q963 Express Chipset Family)</p>
<p>It seems that even though I can get past this error, eventually the black screen of death returns by the next save’s load.</p>
<p>My friend and I have been playing the hell out of Black Mesa and it’s easily the best HL game in the franchise, so let us know what the issue is here so we can finish the damn thing!</p>
<p>PS: I found the pizza.</p>
