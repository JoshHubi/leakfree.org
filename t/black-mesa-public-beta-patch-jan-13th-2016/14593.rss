    <title>Black Mesa Public Beta Patch- Jan 13th 2016</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-public-beta-patch-jan-13th-2016/14593</link>
    <description>Hey everybody!

This isn&#39;t actually a new patch, it&#39;s been out for a little while now. I&#39;m comfortable with what we have now though to kind of publically say &quot;we have issues fixed and we need help checking!&quot; A reminder though is that this is a BETA patch. Which means that the fixes are intended to work, but may not work as intended. (buggy bug fixes!).

If you&#39;re interested in trying things out, or if there is a fix for something that you&#39;re interested in, you can opt-into the public beta *right now!* (if you own the steam version of the game). To participate: right click on in your steam browser, click &quot;Properties.&quot; Go to the Beta Tab. Select &quot;Public Beta.&quot; You&#39;re now in the Public Beta! If you no longer want to be part of the public beta branch, you can go back to the Beta&#39;s tab under properties, and set your beta to &quot;none - Opt out of all betas.&quot;  When you opt in, you&#39;ll see a download happening, that&#39;s perfectly normal.

As of Jan 13th, 2016 the Public Beta changes from the Crossfire Update are as followed:

* Added muzzle flash dynamic light checkbox to options menu.
* Added godrays enable checkbox to the options menu
* Minor optimizations made to netcode.
* Crossfire performance optimizations.
* Fixed &#39;FIX IT DENIZ&#39; skin on monitor in UC.
* Polished the workshop tool. (like, it works now, and you can upload thumbnails).*
[list][*]ingame UI for the &quot;workshop addons&#39;&quot; button in the menu is a much larger bug, so it has not been fixed. the rest of the uploader is working better now.
[/*:m][/list:u]

*The workshop tool now places mods in the SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890 folder. When you subscribe to a mod, it will add a folder with the mods ID, to that folder. The uploader will recognize .vpk mods and non-.vpk mods. It is preferred and considered good practice if you make a .vpk mod. (I will provide instructions on how to do that, later).  I will be creating a full &#39;how to upload a mod&#39; guide here soon.

There may be more things that are fixed that I have missed.

Please keep this thread to JUST the public beta fixes. This is not the place to discuss what needs to be fixed, or bugs that haven&#39;t been fixed yet and/or &#39;why haven&#39;t you fixed XYZ bug?&#39; discussions. If I see that the discussion is moving off-topic, I will move or remove posts as necessary. Thanks!

Known issue:
Loading times for Black Mesa for launching the first time during a computer session is longer than it should be.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>In Half-Life 2 speedrunning, that bug’s referred to as Schrodinger’s Crouching, if I recall. If you start holding crouch again in the middle of standing up from a crouch, the player hitbox is still crouching, while the camera gets disconnected at the height you were at when you <span class="bbcode-i">started</span> crouching again. I don’t know if I’m explaining it very well.</p>
<p>It allows the player to push buttons through walls or ceilings, though I can’t really think of anywhere in Black Mesa that can be exploited that way. Arguably, the more severe effects are 1. the player can see through brushes outside of the map (e.g. getting the camera stuck in the top of a vent) and 2. the disconnect between the player hitbox and camera causes the NPCs’ aiming to get thrown off.</p>

<p>Interesting… That makes sense. Thanks!</p>

<p>Could you explain that bug a bit more?<br>

<p>These bug reports are extremely nice and helpful, but only with some context on to what I should be looking for!</p>

            <p>Went and tried that - There are no missing content errors to speak of when I’m not subscribed to anything.</p>
<p>I deleted the entire bms/addons/ folder to check as well - the missing content errors only start when I subscribe to a mod on the public beta. For what it’s worth, I’ve noticed that the addons that don’t work have just a .bin file in the steamapps/workshop/content/etc. folder, e.g. “35248838811338016_legacy.bin”.</p>

            <p>Those of you who are having issues with Missing textures/models could you check something for me, if comfortable doing so?</p>
<p>Unsubscribe to all your mods.<br>
Go to the Black Mesa Workshop download folder (SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890)<br>
Delete EVERYTHING in that folder.<br>
Go and launch the game again and tell me if the missing textures/error models still appear.</p>
<p>We believe this issue is due to a legacy file issue with mods and the new workshop system we’re using.</p>

            <p>Late reply, but I’m talking about addons working <span class="bbcode-i">on</span> the public beta, though. I’ve resubscribed to all of them, but the content just doesn’t load in-game.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, what I’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying the .vpk’s from /addons/workshop into the addons folder and deleting all other instances of the addons - vanilla content is used in-game</li>
<li>Resubscribing to every single addon - get missing content errors in-game</li>
<li>Copying the .vpk’s from /addons/workshop into the /steamapps/workshop/content/362890 folder - get missing content errors in-game</li>
<li>Copying the .vpk’s from /addons/workshop into the corresponding subfolder in /steamapps/workshop/content/362890 (the one addon that <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> work on the public beta - Crypt’s HD-style arms - had a .vpk file in there) - get missing content errors in-game</li>
<li>Deleting <span class="bbcode-b">everything</span> in the /steamapps/workshop/content/362890 folder, as well as deleting the entire /addons folder, and resubscribing to an addon - get missing content errors in-game<br>
Is this a bug, or am I just an idiot?</li>
</ul>

            <p>I have had best results by opting <span class="bbcode-i">out</span> of the public beta, subscribing to a workshop addon, then moving the files downloaded int the old “addons” folder (<span class="bbcode-i">NOT</span> the “workshop” folder inside of it!) after condensing them into .vpks.</p>

<p>You need to resubscribe to all the workshop content, as it needs a specific folder with the workshop item ID. When you sub, it’ll make a folder in the content/362890 folder with a unique number and the content inside that. Can’t just drop the .vpk’s into the addons folder.</p>

<p>Went ahead and resubscribed to all of my workshop addons - a vast majority of them are still not working.</p>

            <ul>
<li>The first problem:<br>
Very long start the game, it came to the point that the last 20 minutes, and the game and are not included.<br>
10 Windows 64-bit<br>
The AMD Athlon 64 Dual Core 2.8Ghz<br>
RAM 4gb</li>
<li>The second problem<br>
Workshop<br>
Audio files do not work, I now publishes Russian voice, textures and subtitle Workshop, and faced with such a problem.<br>
If you use to download Tools “p2map_publish.exe” have to share large files over 100 MB on the stable version running on a beta patch and is not,<br>
If you use the “blackmesa_publish.exe”, is in a stable version of the publication is not working at all, not packed VPK, not unpacked, and the beta patch works only textures, sounds are not working.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you try to connect an addon that replaces the audio files, the console says this:</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>Cannot figure out which search path sound\vo\inbound_tram\tram_01_goodmorning.wav came from.  Absolute path is E:/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/362890/600910999/bms_sound_vo_russian.vpk/sound/vo/inbound_tram/tram_01_goodmorning.wav<br>
Failed to load sound “vo\inbound_tram\tram_01_goodmorning.wav”, file probably missing from disk/repository</p>
</div>
<p>And so every time you try to play sound.<br>
If you enter the console snd_restart sound appears.</p>
<p>But subtitles do not run and not managed by any means.</p>
