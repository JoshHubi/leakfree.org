    <title>Dual Monitor Flicker</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dual-monitor-flicker/8513</link>
    <description>So, I recently got a new monitor, and I decided i wanted to use a dual monitor setup. The problem is, whenever I do anything on my primary monitor, the secondary one flickers. I have a 5830, and I&#39;ve tried disable AMD Overdrive to no success. I&#39;m using the windows dual monitor setup, the one you setup through the windows control panel instead of CCC, because it allows me to keep my resolutions separate and it looks alot better IMO, but it flickers like mad no matter what I&#39;m doing. It also switches to my primary monitor after I play a game, but i can stop that flickering by disabling my second monitor and re-enabling it. I&#39;d like to know if there is a way to fix this flickering while keeping the setup I have. Thanks.</description>

            <p>Could be a bad DVI to VGA adapter or bad video cable.</p>
<p>Try see if your monitors are both properly grounded, at my boss’s house the 2nd monitor was making weird bright/dark waves on-screen, so I unplugged it from the power bar and onto another and the waves disappeared.</p>

            <p>Refresh rates are currently at whatever the respective monitor’s native is. I have still yet to pinpoint any fix.</p>

            <p>I have a 5800 and if I overclock too much my monitors flicker. Sure there’s nothing else going on there? Tried both screens on their own? Cable swapped?</p>
