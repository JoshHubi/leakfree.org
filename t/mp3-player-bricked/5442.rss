    <title>Mp3 player bricked?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp3-player-bricked/5442</link>
    <description>So i have a Creative Nomad MuVo TX Mp3 player(512 MB version). It had started to turn off randomly, so i followed Creative&#39;s advice, updating it. I downloaded the update utility(yes, i made sure it was the right one) with the version 1.22.03. While updating, at the Allocating Table phase, i got an fatal error that said &quot;Operating system reported error: The semaphore timeout period has expired.&quot;. I get this error every time i try to update. I also tried the MP3 Player Recovery tool from Creative, and it crashes when it is starting to download the firmware. Also, my MP3 player now won&#39;t turn on, and it doesn&#39;t show up in Explorer, but Windows recognizes it as a device in recovery mode. I have tried this on 2 PCs (Windows XP Pro and Home), and both have the same errors.

Anyone know of something?</description>

            <p>I know, but it has worked really well, good battery capacity and stuff, and i don’t listen to more than 512 MB of my music anyways. I have an iPod too, but the headphone plug is broken…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Or you could get a new player with more capacity. They’re not that expensive.</p>

            <p>Windows XP doesn’t need drivers or programs to put files on this MP3 player, but when i updated it needed drivers, so it shouldn’t be a fucked up driver or program. But i’ll check out their forums ;D</p>

            <p>Having been through a bricked Sansa express a couple of times, my advice would be the following:<br>
find the community forums, there should be threads about different techniques to unbrick it.<br>
try downgrading the firmware. That’s what I had to do the second time my sansa bricked. There should be a way to do it (at least manually). If it works you can upgrade then back again.</p>
<p>It’s good that you’ve tried it on a different PC, but make sure it hasn’t got precisely the same apps and drivers on it. When my mp3 was bricked, I could only get it working on my friends PC. I assume it’s because some of the external device drivers I had (probably nokia’s) were fucking shit up.</p>
