    <description>I downloaded Half-Life Black Mesa yesterday. I was playing the whole night. Today I can not find a half-life black mesa in my games section (Steam). It is as if the game was not installed on my computer! Hmm I read on the internet that some people had this problem. Anyone have a clue about this:&#39;(? The only way i can play the game is : i reinstall it then at the end and i click yes i wanna play now!! Lol seem&#39;s wrong man... Heelppp !!!</description>

            <p>Did you have a system crash? It may take over 20 minutes to get back your files.</p>
<p>Did you sync the game to Steam, so that it showed in your library?</p>
