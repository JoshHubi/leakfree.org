    <title>Crash at the OaR rocket launch area</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-at-the-oar-rocket-launch-area/10354</link>
    <description>Help? 

So I&#39;m playing through On a Rail, everything&#39;s fine. Get to the outside area where those two HECU marines are going on about Freeman and then... bam. Hit with a MASSIVE lag spike and sound skip (The music was trying to come up but kept skipping badly). My HUD and escape menu also disappeared when the lag started, and I had to do a Ctrl+Alt+Del out of the game. I&#39;m glad I had it windowed, cause I think it might have blue-screened my computer if it wasn&#39;t. 

This is the only place in the whole game this happened. Nowhere else was the lag spike this bad.</description>

            <p>Eh. Might just be my computer then. I don’t want to have the purple/black errors when running DX8, so I’ll just not go to the rocket launching area and skip it.</p>
<p>Hopefully it’ll be fine with the Steam release.</p>

            <p>Had no lagspikes and/or any of the bugs described in this whole section during both of my playthroughs. Derp.<br>
Launch it in DX8 mode, get past that part, then launch it in DX9 mode again.</p>
