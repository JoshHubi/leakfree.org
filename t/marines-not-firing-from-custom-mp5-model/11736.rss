    <title>Marines not firing from custom MP5 model</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/marines-not-firing-from-custom-mp5-model/11736</link>
    <description>Hi,

First of all, I don&#39;t know is this the right forum to post this, but I have a problem. I&#39;ve replaced MP5 with custom M4 skin/model for HL2 (swapped the .mdl&#39;s). It&#39;s all working, but the marines are not firing form it. They just stand and aim at me, but nothing else. However, they still can meele. I can use that skin without problems. Am I doing something wrong? Can somebody help me with this issue?

Also, there is one strange thing - I&#39;ve replaced it back with a backup of the original MP5, but the marines are still not using it...</description>

            <p>The problem is, that I’ve not made that model, and I have zero experience with modeling. But as I said, strange thing is that even when I’ve replaced it with original MP5, marines are still not using it… I will check it again when I start a new game with original MP5.</p>

            <p>There might be some things unique to Black Mesa’s weapon models which are not in Half-Life 2’s, you could probaly edit this if you can use 3ds Max or a program like it.</p>
