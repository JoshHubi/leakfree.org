    <title>Any plans on porting to Linux?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/any-plans-on-porting-to-linux/15240</link>
    <description>I&#39;m glad that Black Mesa is becoming a full game. It&#39;s fun on Windows and all. But I mainly use Linux, and it&#39;d be nice to not have to reboot everytime I want to play Black Mesa. I get the majority of people use Windows and all that good stuff, but Source is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. So it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense why (unless it has HDR with DirectX). But yeah, the game is great so far, so sorry if this seemed a bit uhhhh passive-aggressive.</description>

            <p>I think somewhat similar is overstating it. They’re both UNIX based, but the common heritage ends in like the 1980s. They’re basically about as separate as Windows and Linux at this point in time.</p>

            <p>I am by no means an expert on porting, but from my understanding, Mac and Linux have somewhat similar back ends, which means a Mac port shouldn’t be too difficult now that the Linux port is done.</p>
<p>Unless you have to use a special Apple API or something, I don’t know.</p>

<p>My mistake. Could have sworn I saw some bug reports for a Mac version somewhere…</p>

<p>There is only one reason why and that is the work required to do it. If there was a big shiny red Port button in hammer it would have already been done.<br>
In other words porting, even if the engine supports a different OS, is no simple thing.</p>
