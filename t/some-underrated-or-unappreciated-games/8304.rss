    <description>What are some game you think are underrated or unappreciated.

I&#39;m gonna start flat out and say Duke Nukem Forever.
The game itself isn&#39;t bad, TBH I think people are just complaining because it wasn&#39;t exactly like they had expected, and they expected it to be almost like Duke Nukem 3D.

Beyond Good and Evil

Jamestown the lost colony

and some others, I don&#39;t remember.</description>

<p>That’s what I mean, people rated the game on stuff around it and not the game itself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That may be what you mean, but it’s not what I mean.  If the game is good, it’s good, for it’s score it doesn’t matter if there is better stuff out there.  I wouldn’t look and say “well I gave game X a 90 and it was better, so I’ll give game Y an 85.”  I would judge them both on their own merits and not pay attention to other scores when coming up with a new one.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Call of Duty (only bringing it up because you did) doesn’t suffer from having a “short” development time (2 years isn’t that bad for a sequel) it’s just that they barely change anything.  The problem, for me, is that I don’t particularly like the gameplay as a whole.  There are aspects of it that I enjoy, but as a package, it sucks, and they’re not changing the things that suck about it.  Or at least, they’re not changing them for the better.</p>

<p>That’s why I said pre-Force Unleashed games.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I still believe a good deal of Star Wars games went under-appreciated.</p>
<p>Now if only Lucarsarts would make Battlefront 3, Republic Commando 2, or another Jedi Knight game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Custom Robo for Gamecube.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t call the game <span class="bbcode-i">good,</span> but the gameplay as a general rule is pretty fun. Robots are insanely customizable and movement controls are tight. The story veers mostly into “so bad it’s good” territory, where I frequently do a MST3K style running commentary when I play.</p>
<p>I should do an LP of that game at some point…<br>
(Edit: Dammit, it’s been done &gt;&lt;)</p>

<p>Hell, when I first found KotoR, at Gamestop, it was on the very bottom shelf with all the shit games. It was also on a buy 1 get 1 free thing. So I got KotoR and KotoR 2. I thoroughly enjoyed them both. (This was in 2004 btw)</p>

</aside>
<p>I found KOTOR II for 20 bucks at a Target. I don’t think KOTOR games are underrated and underappreciated. They’re often regarded as some of the best RPGs even today, at least by Star Wars standards. But seriously, Jedi Outcast for 5 bucks? That’s underappreciated. I mean, I’m glad it’s 5 bucks because that meant I didn’t have to pay more, but still.</p>
<p>Force Unleashed II by the way, I think is slightly <span class="bbcode-i">over</span>rated. Just slightly though. The game didn’t seem finished and was pretty shoehorned in just to have a sequel.</p>

<p>That’s what I mean, people rated the game on stuff around it and not the game itself. If that were the case MW3 should have gotten a worse score than Duke Nukem, a year to come up with the same game and graphics, I would count that as a “HUGE waste of development” time. I’ve seen HL2 mods made in a year with better gameplay, storylines, multiplayer, and sometimes graphics.</p>

<p>Now maybe it doesn’t deserve a 3 point-something, but the 5-6 reviews were right on the money. If anything, I think OTHER games should get as low as DNF for failing in the same ways.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I agree with this, the flaw is that other games had much shorter development cycles, which is most likely why they would rate higher.<br>
(at least that’s how I would do it, if it’s in development for 10+ years, it better be F’ing amazing, otherwise I’ll lower the rating with the excuse of “wasted development time”)</p>

<p>Agreed. But, man was that game unoptimized…even if I have 2 radeon 6970’s it still lags sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well that’s mainly because they tried to cram everything they possibly could in the huge levels to make it look as good as possible - It’s mainly due to the vegetation. Some maps have hundreds of thousands of vegetation objects (which is admittedly kinda ridiculous, but still works well for the environment)</p>
<p>That’s probably the biggest thing they had to take out for the console re-release, like more then half the vegetation lol.</p>
<p>That’s also why Warhead ran a lot better, it did have some engine optimizations, but for the most part it was the maps. The maps were still fairly expansive, but they didn’t put every single detail they could in it, and there weren’t <span class="bbcode-i">as</span> many sprawling open areas with vegetation. (In fact, you can get the Crysis levels in warhead and running it in the warhead engine affects performance very slightly, if at all.)</p>

<p>Agreed. But, man was that game unoptimized…even if I have 2 radeon 6970’s it still lags sometimes.</p>

        <title>Some Underrated or Unappreciated Games</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The MDK series, namely MDK 2. I barely see anything about it but It used to be one of my favorites. That damn black hole grenade was fun.</p>
<p>Hexen series - excellent games to play in coop, actually difficult. Hexen 2 was especially good IMO</p>
<p>Daggerfall - Not underrated but one of my favorites (surprisingly, AFTER I played morrowind) and I wish I had owned it when I was a kid.</p>
<p>Hellfire Expansion for Diablo - The Hive levels sucked and most people dropped it at that, but the Crypts were a great extension to Diablo, fit very well, and most people didn’t even get close to them before dropping it. If only it had BNET support (It does have MP support now, but you need hamachi or Tuungle)</p>
<p>I’d also say the Descent series. It was rated very highly but it seems to have faded into obscurity, and the only clone I ever saw was Forsaken. Descent 3 wasn’t as good as the others (mediocre music and crappy sound design, player ship wasn’t cool, level design was good but the mission structure wasn’t as memorable as the whole “escape before the timer hits zero” thing D1 and D2 did) but it was still pretty good.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with you personally on that one. I wouldn’t have minded DNF’s bad level design and other stuff like bad music, but aside from the shotgun and the devastator, the game’s gun play was flat out terrible, and not fun if at all. Most of the guns felt awkward to use, even the freezer (which was my favorite from Duke3D). IMO nothing that was supposed to pack a punch felt like it did.</p>
<p>Now maybe it doesn’t deserve a 3 point-something, but the 5-6 reviews were right on the money. If anything, I think OTHER games should get as low as DNF for failing in the same ways.</p>

            <p>XIII - I really liked it. Shame it’s never gonna have a sequel. The new one (the adventure) doesn’t count as it’s an adventure and has a different story.</p>

            <p>Alpha Protocol is an unappreciated and flawed gem. While it mostly deserves the low scores it got in reviews, it’s actually a fairly fun and deep game once you start shaping your character towards something that works for you.</p>
<p>This game also has a very interesting way in which you influence the world with your actions that goes beyond anything that Bioware and Bethesda have done lately.</p>
<p>It sucks that Obsidian has the worst programmers and gameplay designers, because the technical issues and gameplay annoyances it is plagued with cast a big shadow over all the virtues it has.</p>
<p>It is also too bad that Obsidian will probably never be able to make an improved sequel.</p>
