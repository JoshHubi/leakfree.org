    <title>Graphics card not working</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/graphics-card-not-working/287</link>
    <description>I have a Radeon X800 SE Sapphire Graphics card, and all drivers I download don&#39;t work. When I try to download directly from the site, it says that X800 has been moved to a support structure, or something along the lines of that. I can&#39;t figure out whether or not you have to download the Support Structure, or if I&#39;ll need to get a new Graphics card...

Please, help me if you know anything.</description>

<p>Hey but you can put 4 GTXes)))<br>
New Mac Pro video card solution is plainly idiotic. It’s even more amusing since previous generation featured an option for QUADRO FX cards.<br>
Oh yeah, it’s probably because Quadro FXs do not have mini-display port. Who the hell is the man in charge of this fucked up crap?</p>

            <p>Why didn’t you suggest the x1950?<br>
Though investing in AGP at this point is investing in something that has been dead for a while already…it was a dead end 2 years ago…it’s a graveyard now.</p>

            <p>gotta wait for a mod to do it for you. If they feel so inclined as to close it. But they won’t close it unless it’s a really stupid, pointless thread that has absolutely no purpose in being open. And I’m not gonna pass judgement.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s interesting that my first thread started an epic battle of the graphics cards.</p>
<p>I already got one of the old ones I had re-installed because I couldn’t find a card that fit in my computer (AGP), and I haven’t been recently trying so hard to get the new one I have fixed.</p>
<p>P.S as previously stated, this is my first thread, so… I don’t know how to close it. if someone could tell/do it for me, I’d be thankful.</p>

            <p>Oh for the love of god… OMG GUYZ GET AN ATI CRAD COZ A HIGH END ATI PART OUTPERFORMS A LOW END NVIDIA PART.</p>
<p>Apple’s choice of graphics cards never fails to amaze me. How they can, in all seriousness, put a GTX 120 into a Mac Pro, is utterly inexpicable. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/04/266ghz-8-core-mac-pro-review.ars/4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">I’m not the only one who’s confused.</a></p>
<p>On topic: the OP already said he’s gotten things working with another card, so why is everyone still telling him to get a new graphics card (and not only that, recommending PCIe cards which won’t work with his AGP setup)?</p>

            <p>I’ve never used the ATI Radeon graphics card. I have a NVIDIA 9400M graphics card. I just recommended ATI Radeon because the test on the Mac Pro Desktop website shows the ATI Radeon HD 4870 outperforming the weaker NVIDIA GeForce GT 120. The ATI Radeon HD 4870 had up to 6.6x improvement compared to the previous standard graphics card that Mac Pro Desktops used which was a ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT. For the OP of this thread, I recommend that he buys a powerful NVIDIA or ATI Radeon graphics card that is in his price range.</p>

            <p>I used to use the radeon x1950 pro 512 mb AGP gpu. Problem is my new pc doesn’t use AGP. I now for the moment am using the nvidia 9400 GT 1 gig. I am also running my pc with the intel i7 920 2.67 cpu with the D0 stepping. 6 gig of ddr3 ram. Nice machine imo and the compile times in hammer are way faster than my old pc.</p>
<p>But yeah, my gpu is okay, but I could do with an upgrade.</p>

            <p>Oh god. I like ATi over nVidia, but just cos a mac has a gfx card doesn’t mean that it’s a good graphics card. You can buy MUCH better GPUs than macs come with. Use something like <a href="http://tomshardware.com" rel="nofollow noopener">tomshardware.com</a> and buy whatever brand has the best value. Typically it’s ati, but there are exceptions.</p>
<p>I would get a Radeon 4770 over a 9800 any day. They’re under $100 and as good as a 9800 in most games. Right now, they are hands-down the best value for the money. Even better value if you get 2. If you can find one, that is.</p>

            <p>I have a laptop that crashes occasionally in Fallout 2.</p>
<p>It can’t run Half-Life without crashing.</p>
<p>It takes over ten minutes to start up.</p>
<p>Anyways, <span class="mention">@OP</span>: Get a new graphics card. Better yet, a whole new computer. I suggest the Nvidia 9800 GTX+ and higher.</p>

<p>Oh yeah?  My family comp back home has an nVidia TNT2 from sometime in the <span class="bbcode-i">90s</span>.  This graphics card can’t run HALO.  And we’re talking HALO <span class="bbcode-b">1</span> here.  Damn comp barely runs firefox… and my dad refuses to upgrade it.</p>

<p>Okay. What about an NVIDIA 9400M or a NVIDIA 9600M GT? Would that work for this individual whose graphics card is not working?</p>

            <p>Cept he has an AGP mobo. And you can’t buy GT 120s and they suck. I dunno where they fit in relative to other cards, but the specs for 4850s are better. I wouldn’t use Mac Pros as a graphics benchmark except maybe with the Quadro cards, and even then, meh. I wouldn’t use Alienware either.</p>
