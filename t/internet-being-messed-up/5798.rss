    <title>Internet being messed up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/internet-being-messed-up/5798</link>
    <description>This occured on around ~17th october, that my/our internet has started to be running very slow. On the following week, I was lucky if I could even get a DL speed of 2 mbps, and a upload speed of 0.01 mbps.
The first thought I got when this happened, was probably a cap or something. So I&#39;ve waited until today, which it SHOULD reset (?)

Today, the speeds are as following:

6 mbps                          down                (should be 7-8 )
0.01-0.05 mbps               up                    (should be 0.8 )

(note the 8000 ping in my steam community name)
That number is there for a reason, and the reason is quite obvious.
&quot;no&quot; upload speed, no ping, no game.

I really have no idea WHY it is like this, it has happened like 5 times before. But when that happened, it only lasted for 3-7 days. Now it has been over 2 weeks.
6 mbps is acceptable for what I should have, but the upload speed is just a bag of shame.
I&#39;m running on wireless to a modem/router (same box), in the next room. It is a thomson TG784

Any suggestions on this, if possible?</description>

<p>The only problem I see with that is their life span. After all, they have to feed those hamsters steroids to get them to those speeds. Sad, ain’t it?</p>

            <p>Well you could try to pull a wire from your PC to the router, to see if it’s the wireless that is causing problems.<br>
If you have another computer or laptop connected on your network, you could try transfering something in the LAN and see if it’s as fast as it should be. A ping to the router probably won’t tell you much.</p>
<p>Also, on most ISP website you can go check your bandwidth usage, if it’s a capping issue, you could see it there. And it won’t necessarily reset at midnight…</p>
