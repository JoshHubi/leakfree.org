    <title>Crashing in Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-in-surface-tension/63048</link>
    <description>Hi folks,

Black Mesa crashed two times in the same spot when shooting the same trip mine. On the third try it didn&#39;t crash again. But when I switched windows(borderless) to look at another screen, the game crashed in the same spot. I don&#39;t know if the two kind of crashes are related.

I would like to attach dumpfiles, but it seem like I&#39;m not authorized to upload files...
