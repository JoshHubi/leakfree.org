    <description>[align=center][b]Break Out [/b][/align]

[b]Update :[/b]

I am working on the intro and outro of Break Out, still no luck doing it.

[b]Update 2 :[/b]

I am putting a hold on this project for awhile, this is due to personal problems, giving me a hard time to focus.
Don&#39;t worry, it will be back, just taking a break from everything because i need it.

[b]Update 3 :[/b]

Work on the game has been continued for awhile.
The level design for map 1 and 2 is done, only need to finish things up.
Level 3 level design is still a work in progress, but close to finalization stages.

After i&#39;ve finished the first 3 levels, i will release an public beta so can try it out for yourselves.
Every bug report, suggestion or help is welcome.

[b]Update 4 :[/b]

Demo release will be next month.
I think i will include 3 levels in this demo.
Not sure.

[b]Update 5 :[/b]
[b]
Attention Beta Testers ![/b]

I am not gonna make the demo release next months so i&#39;ll release the beta that only features level 2.
Suggestions and bug reports are welcome.
Keep in mind that this is not in any way finished !

Link :
Request a link because i need some testers and i don&#39;t want too much publicity.

NOTE :
The image is still UNFINISHED.

[b]Storyline[/b]
Your name is John Provat, you are a scientist working at the Coredo Research Facility Labs ( CRFL ).
Your late on your work and you need to test unknown DNA of a creature that has recently been caught.
When you finally arrive on work, you notice that everyone&#39;s acting strange today.
You get your lab to test the DNA, when you are analyzing it, you notice that the DNA of the Unknown creature includes some human DNA, that is weird, this means it is or was a human.
When you are at the terminal to report that the power went out, you suddenly hear a scream behind you.

<p>I meant the Hpl level editor is harder than source ofcourse.<br>
I’ll be using UDK for the sequel.<br>
Now it’s not the time to switch to another engine.<br>
I have worked too long to just throw it all away and redo all the levels.<br>
Level 1 took me 5-6 months.<br>
Just because i was experimenting and trying to figure out what to do next.</p>
<p>Starting an level isn’t hard, but finishing a level is.</p>

<p>If you are creating free 3D indie games then go with UDK or Unity 3D.<br>
You can ofcause use them for commercial games but it will cost you a license.</p>

</aside>
<p>I am not a beginner with the Source engine.<br>
I’ve already created a survival map for L4D.<br>
It’s pretty easy to create a map when you understand the engine.<br>
I am also creating an campaign for Amnesia.<br>
This is much harder for beginners than Source.</p>
<p>I am just using FPS Creator because it’s easy to use and you can create maps pretty quick if you’ll like to.<br>
Also because i am developing my game over 8 months and i don’t think it’s a smart move to migrate to another engine.<br>
I am the only guy working on this game, but schreurder motivates me and helps me out with some important stuff.<br>
The deadline is in 2012.<br>
I didn’t tell anyone about this, except schreurder, as co-operating with me.<br>
Although, for my next game i do think to move to another engine.<br>
Don’t know which one would be the best.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right, i have many problems with this engine.<br>
It’s also getting in the way of development, but it is not holding me back.<br>
I am using as many custom scripts as i can.<br>
As far as i know, there is not one script that is written by the FPSC Team.</p>

<p>The actual content is already there, but it is not made public yet.<br>
I am really doubting if i should make it public or not, because if i did make it public, some people can’t understand the word unfinished and go posting some unnecessary and unpleasant things.<br>
Most of them do not post constructive comments, only whine or blame the developer for not running it well on their computer.</p>
<p>So, i can upload some unfinished beta, or rather alpha, but i am afraid that would only do harm to me and to the game.</p>

            <p>Sorry guys, it is not about blocks.<br>
Think of Doom or Half-Life, it’s inspired by that.<br>
But it will be involving the story much more then the action ( think Doom 3 ).<br>
I promise you will not be dissapointed, you will be scared or jump out of your seat a few times, or both  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Also it is more about atmosphere, so remember Amnesia ( without the puzzles ).</p>

When you finally arrive on work, you notice that everyone’s acting strange today.<br>
You get your lab to test the DNA, when you are analyzing it, you notice that the DNA of the Unknown creature includes some human DNA, that is weird, this means it is or was a human.<br>
