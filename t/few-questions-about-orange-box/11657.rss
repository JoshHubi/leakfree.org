    <title>Few Questions about Orange Box</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/few-questions-about-orange-box/11657</link>
    <description>Hello all :slight_smile:  

I am going to install few mods to HL2. It&#39;s only graphics enhancements. And I have few questions about that.

I&#39;m wondering if mods for HL2 will work with EP1 and EP2? I mean, I have pistol retexture to HL2 (to put in &quot;materials&quot; folder), the same pistol is in EP1 and EP2 so if I just put it in &quot;materials&quot; folder of EPs will this work IF it&#39;s working with HL2? 

I heard that if I have OB all mods of this kind will work with episodes. But I&#39;m not sure about that.

And maybe u know good textures mod for HL2 and Episodes 1,2? You know, graphics enhance etc... and it cannot be cinematic mod 11/12. I have only 2GB ram and graphic card 256mb GDDR3.

THX!</description>

            <p>It’ll work on any HL2 game, just remember that the addons don’t always go in the “hl2” folder.</p>
