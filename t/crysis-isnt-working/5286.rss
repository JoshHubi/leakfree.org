    <title>Crysis isnt working.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crysis-isnt-working/5286</link>
    <description>Hi all, ive had this problem for a while now, when ever i boot Crysis i just get a black screen, have to ctrl+Alt+Delete to get out and cancel it or press ESC and that works.

Was working before any updates, so, I removed all the updates, and all of the games (maximum edition) and all registry files, nothing left of it, so reinstalled.

Still not working, black screen follow by &#39;program not working&#39; from windows.

Im ALL up to DATE drivers wise.</description>

<p>also check event viewer (windows key, type in event viewer and click the option) after the crash and post any new events logged by the system here.</p>
<p>does it create a dump upon crash? i may be able to pinpoint whats causing it if there is one</p>

<p>Your 8800GT ran at 115°C?  Holy cripes!  Superclocked?  I had an eVGA 8800GT and it maybe, MAYBE would hit 60°C during Crysis.  Any other game was &lt;60, and most were &lt;50 - idle was 38°C (all according to RivaTuner and GPU-Z).</p>

<p>My H50s push and pull helps cooling, along with keeping the fans at 75% [semi audible] speed while playing intense games like Crysis. Source engine stuff I run the fans at 70% [barely audible] and keep temps under 90c across the board. If I really want to ensure safety, I can always knock them up to 80-85% since I play with headphones and barely hear them.</p>
<p>OT: I remember you saying via steam chat that the game crashed once you change your resolution. Why not tap into the video config files [I know they exist…somewhere] and set your stuff manually. See if that’ll help?</p>

<p>When i did the uninstall for Crysis is chose to remove save games and profiles, but not for Warhead.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Fact is game ran fine on the current drivers i have now.</span></span></span></p>

<p>What error message did it throw?  Literally “Program not working”, like <a href="https://blog.ekendraonline.com/uploads/2009/09/windowsexplorerhangedinwindows7.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this guy here</a>?  Also, open up the EventVwr, then launch the game and when it crashes you should get an immediate entry in the EventVwr - yes/no?</p>
<p>Also, when did the game run fine on the drivers you have now?  Did you have the GTX480 in an older system and then upgraded everything else?</p>

I actually tested this, I noticed how the motherboard temperature is always around 30-40 C even if the CPU and memory are under full load. Yet as soon as I started stressing the videocard the motherboard temperature rised by almost 15 degrees.

<p>This was my logic on giving up. I have my sources, he has his. [Just to get my little bit in again, I took my card to 105c last night running the Fuzzy artifact testing software, no artifacts and no melted GPU, still runs like a beauty]</p>
<p>As far as Crysis is concerned. Have you re-downloaded it? Because if you said it worked with the crack and then without as well yet still fails. I want to say there is a buggy file somewhere. Maybe in your MyGames folder?</p>

<p>I had the same problem, I got FarCry 2 with my graphics card but apparantly it crashes after 30 min to 1 hour. Using DirectX9.0 instead of DirectX10.0 solved the problem, many more people have this problem.</p>

<p>Okay, so you simply just said that the GTX480 was designed to withstand temperatures up to 105c. Same thing I’ve been saying this whole time, I just wasn’t generic about it because the current issue at hand, involves a GTX480. So I targeted that card and said it was designed to take temperatures that high. I could have said every card was and I would still have been right. If you still don’t see it, then ask someone else to explain it to you.</p>
<p>And sure, it COULD over heat surrounding items but if you have a solid airflow, it’ll keep the temps down quite well. And if someone has a GTX480 on a R3E like myself, the NB optional cooler helps correct that issue.</p>

<p>thats cause you dont have an understanding of how it works…</p>
<p>If you have good cooling as you keep boasting, your cards shouldnt pass 70C under load. Temps over 80C are hot and temps over 90 will slowly bake your memory to failure. You GPU will be fine, your graphics card will not. Have fun frying your own cards but dont tell others that 92C temps are fine for extended use because “thats what they were designed for”</p>

<p>they are also NOT designed to run at 105C…that is simply the maximum temperature they can withstand. Design specifications and tolerance specifications are NOT the same.
