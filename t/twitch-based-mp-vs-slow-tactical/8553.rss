    <title>Twitch based MP vs Slow/tactical?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/twitch-based-mp-vs-slow-tactical/8553</link>
    <description>As the title says, what type of multiplayer games do you guys prefer? The 

tactical aim-eccentric shoot first type of games where tactics (when you play

 with smart people) matter the most like BF or CS versing a good opponent, or 

fast-paced, twitch skill shooters like Quake or UT or Tribes where you get a lot 

of health, large amounts of weapons and speed, layout memorization, and 

health management and route planning are key?</description>

<p>Just did that, quite chaotic but once you get used to it and the speed of the bots everything else in other games just feels so much easier to aim at.</p>

<p>I like em all, really. I go back and forth between sauerbraten/xonotic, and Battlefield. I’ve been playing Halo CE a lot more now that I have it working though, which is like right in the middle. Sometimes I play twitch shooters to “work out” before playing a slower paced shooter. After playing about an hour of an instagib server sauerbraten, I can guarantee that you will be a human aimbot when you play battlefield, COD, or anything else like that afterward.</p>

            <p>I hate getting shot in BF3 because it’s so boring. I miss when games made you feel like you died - even ragdoll in first person would accomplish that better.</p>

            <p>Oh, I am sick of that stupid death animation but the rest of the game is nice. I don’t understand why they decided to make it so when you die you stick your hand out even if your actual body gets flung by an explosion. Should have just switched to a third person view of your death. And the death animations in general for me are really jerky  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  .</p>

            <p>Pretty much. There’s only so much depth in the virtual world to perceive. I also can’t tell the bad guys apart from my own teammates in Battlefield.</p>
<p>I stopped playing that game after seeing the exact same first-person death animation over and over again. How are people not sick of that?</p>

            <p>My problem with Slow, tactical multiplayer is that I never encounter anyone to kill. Every time I try to play CoD or Battlefield, or even TF2, I end up roaming around the map waiting for someone to pop out. Hi-tension zones die out before I get there.</p>
<p>My problem with Twitch multiplayer is I don’t know many exploits and I always have the shitty gun that does negative zero damage or takes four years to charge up.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because an awesome medic like Comrade Tiki could parachute in, pick off your killer, and revive you at the last second.</p>
<p>Even without rescue, that 15 seconds of dying would allow you to see what became of your resting place… if an enemy tank moved in to take the flag… if a group of guys took off in a jeep for one of your team’s other command points… Being dead is useful, either by giving hope or letting the state of the world seep in.</p>

            <p>I like both,but…</p>
<p>Fast based twitch based are for those times I’m feeling hyper active and I just want to get to the action and have a blast. I am very good at any game I play(except for those rare ones) so losing really doesn’t put me down as I know it was because of bad teamwork. There isn’t any strategy to these types of games. Tribes: Ascend is really awesome, and has gotten me back into the “unreal-groove”. I loved UT3, but it wasn’t my favorite, for some reason I really love old-school Unreal with it’s fast-paced,low-poly, and body-dismantling action lol. Maybe I do have a strategy in these games and I just haven’t realized it, because usually I’m just “run ‘n’ gun”.</p>
<p>There is a middle-ground(well kinda)<br>
CoD is basically Unreal mixed with Battlefield. Which is why kids like it, it feeds their hyperactive minds and their thirst for modern weapons.</p>
<p>Strategy BF and CS I like too, but I usually play it when I’m not too jumpy. Although I know that both games share a team aspect, I don’t usually chat with my teammates. I just don’t like using my mic because there’s always that one douche bag that has to be an 18yr old going on 10, but I usually do fine by myself and help out my team when they need it and I can capture and take down objectives by myself, although I prefer a squad mate to come w/ just in case I mess up and get myself killed.</p>
<p>I like CS, but I don’t at the same time. It really urks me how some people can get a kill with one hit on a knife, but when I try to I only take slivers of HP away until they die. The hit detection is pretty bad, there have been many times where I’ve gotten headshots and questioned how I got them when I wasn’t even aiming for their heads.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Unreal Tournament is grand fun, and I think I would generally go with games like that.</p>
<p>I usually find what makes these games fun is not whether they are twitch or tactical, but how polished and well put together they are within their own genres. I enjoy battlefield because it is about tactics, sneaking, cover, and that is easy to see, easy to do and everyone works within that setting. There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that Unreal Tournament is all about run and gun action, you don’t even camp with the sniper rifle.</p>
<p>Counterstrike seems like it couldn’t really make up it’s mind what it wanted to be, and as a result hiding/camping is frowned upon, and sneaking is not particularily effective. The weapons aren’t accurate enough to be a proper run and gun game either though. Luckily it is polished and solid within it’s<br>
own little wierd world, so it is entertaining enough to play.</p>
<p>A perfect example of what not to do is APB. They threw all of it’s solid gameplay out the window and made a frankenstien mess of what was leftover. What you have is a low health, twitch shooter where some people camp but others don’t and you can kind of sneak but not really, and if you don’t you die. It is some features pulled from this game and a few from that, tied together with baling twine and as a result is an overall frusterating experience.</p>

            <p>I personally like  both types, but I find the fast-paced ones usually more fun because I am good at them and I can hold my own pretty damn well, and it’s quite a rush in games like UT, or Tribes, whereas in BF (which i still love) I can be killed at anytime regardless of how good I am, and those types of games have the occasional issues like spawn killing and other things more often.</p>
<p>I find it funny, I hate waiting for respawn times but BF2 and 3 are 2 of my favorite games and while BF3’s isn’t that long, BF2’s was 15 seconds, yet it never annoyed me in that game for some reason</p>

            <p>I’ve been playing Tribes Ascend for a bit, and by playing I mean losing horribly. While I like the idea of that type of game I’m just not good enough at it for it to be fun for me. I like to occasionally play it for maybe an hour but I usually end up getting frustrated and quit.</p>

            <p>As the title says, what type of multiplayer games do you guys prefer? The</p>
<p>tactical aim-eccentric shoot first type of games where tactics (when you play</p>
<p>with smart people) matter the most like BF or CS versing a good opponent, or</p>
<p>fast-paced, twitch skill shooters like Quake or UT or Tribes where you get a lot</p>
<p>of health, large amounts of weapons and speed, layout memorization, and</p>
<p>health management and route planning are key?</p>
