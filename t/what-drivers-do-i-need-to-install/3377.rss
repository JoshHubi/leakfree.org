    <title>What drivers do i need to install</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-drivers-do-i-need-to-install/3377</link>
    <description>I had to format my laptop and reinstall windows xp, as well as install my drivers. My laptop model is a T40. Now this is the website that i need to download my drivers from(only the T40 cololum):[url]https://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=lenovo&amp;lndocid=MIGR-46258[/url]

Now under the section Networking: Ethernet and Networking:Wireless, theres a whole bunch of different networking cards. How do i know which is equipped in my laptop?? I cant find out since the hardware is not listed in my device manager, since i didnt install the drivers yet. I tried searching for my model online but even they dont state what networking cards i have. Yesterday i tired installing every driver and testing it out but i had no such luck.

I appreicate any help.</description>

            <p>What  you need to do is find your ethernet card’s hardware ID thru device manager, and pray that a google search of that hwid will get you the drivers you need.</p>
