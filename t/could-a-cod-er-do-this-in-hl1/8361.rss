If you think about it, it all fits. God mode equals Commando Pro, and with having a Gauss while running Opposing Force, you can just say &quot;I swapped my piece of shit pistol for it.&quot;
Many tries were taken, and no slow-mo effect was used.</description>

            <p>I actually liked CoD 2, but it was pretty broken compared to the others.</p>
<p>4 would have been even cooler if they brought back base assault from UO</p>

CoD[COLOR=‘Black’]5: WaW (Actually pretty good [COLOR=‘Black’]at least before the series became shit)<br>

            <p>CoD UO was the best CoD game</p>
<p>It had vehicles and a flamethrower, and mountable machine guns. <span class="bbcode-i">Vehicles</span></p>
<p>And not the scripted type, I’m talking fully drivable in multiplayer, back in 03. Granted BF did vehicles better and before it but before BF3 CoD had better shooting mechanics and more fluid gameplay generally.</p>

            <p>^ Blasphemy.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: United Offensive  &lt;3</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, the best war games -I think- are:</p>
<p>Call of Duty: United Offensive<br>
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare<br>
Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault<br>
Medal of Honor: Airborne</p>
<p>Two of them old, and two of them new.</p>
<p>And of course, the greatest war game of all time is Call of Duty 1.<br>
Seriously, just play it…</p>
<p>Seriously, if you haven’t played one from that list, don’t be surprised if you love it regardless of graphics.</p>

            <p>Tried Cod1 demo. Very slow paced if you ask me.<br>
Played Cod2 on PC a while back and had a bit of fun. Favorite weapon was the Walther pistol.</p>
<p>Oh and to completely understand CoDs aiming system, that includes playing shitty continuations like Black Ops and MW3. Speaking of which, the only thing I had fun with in those two games were Zombies and Survivor.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">First try</span> my ass. Played HL for many years and this is the first time I’ve actually tried this and I did not get it in the first or second try.</p>
<p>You must not understand how CoDs aiming system works. Any 5 year old can grab a controller for the first time, and <span class="bbcode-i">eventually</span> get a no-scope… <span class="bbcode-b">without</span> Steady Aim or even directly aiming at someone. That’s how the series works, I’ve seen it myself, done it myself, and loathed every bit of it.</p>
<p>I’d consider aiming single shot weapons in Half Life harder because your shot <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely</span> has to be exact and it gets tougher to pull off with high speed.<br>
Last I checked, you can’t fly at a sideways angle at 30 miles an hour in any CoD without the fastrun/superjump hack.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">First try</span> my ass. Played HL for many years and this is the first time I’ve actually tried this and I did not get it in the first or second try.</p>
<p>You must not understand how CoDs aiming system works. Any 5 year old can grab a controller for the first time, and <span class="bbcode-i">eventually</span> get a no-scope… <span class="bbcode-b">without</span> Steady Aim or even directly aiming at someone. That’s how the series works, I’ve seen it myself, done it myself, and loathed every bit of it.</p>
<p>I’d consider aiming single shot weapons in Half Life harder because your shot <span class="bbcode-i">absolutely</span> has to be exact and it gets tougher to pull off with high speed.<br>
Last I checked, you can’t fly at a sideways angle at 30 miles an hour in any CoD without the fastrun/superjump hack.</p>

            <p>uuuuhm yeah i know (knew) plenty of cod players who were able to do shit like that on pretty much the first try</p>
<p>also in cod (at least cod1/2/4) guns are way less accurate when not aiming down the sights, so its actually harder in cod than in hl</p>

<p>If you think about it, it all fits. God mode equals Commando Pro, and with having a Gauss while running Opposing Force, you can just say “I swapped my piece of shit pistol for it.”<br>
Many tries were taken, and no slow-mo effect was used.</p>
