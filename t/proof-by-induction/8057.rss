    <description>Hello all,
I have the following problem to solve:

the count of 2-element subsets of a n-element set is (n(n-1)) / 2.

now I should prove that with an induction proof and case differntiation.
How to do this?
I mean the first step is easy, just n=1 and done, but the inductionstep with case differentiation...

Any ideas?</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/mysticj">@MysticJ</a>:<br>
woah, thank you very much!<br>
btw, I began with n=2 in my proof, don’t know why I typed 1 in my post.<br>
anyways, I think I finally understood how this works now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, either the teacher explaining this to you explained it wrongly, or you didn’t pay enough attention.</p>
<p>Usually the first step is chosen in such a way that it actually gives meaningful result. Since a 1-element set cannot have 2-element subsets, it makes more sense to select first step being n=2.</p>
<p>Now, for n=2, there’s only 1 such subset (both of the elements), so 2*1/2 = 1 is correct answer.</p>
<p>Now the induction step:<br>
Assume the theorem is valid for some n=k. Does that make it valid for n=k+1?</p>
<h1>Proof:<br>
The addition of 1 new element does not, in any way, change any of the already constructable (construable?) 2-element subsets that were in the k-element set, so the only difference can and will result from the newly added element x. The new element x has k other elements (the original elements) with which it can form a 2-element subset, and all these possible pairs must be added.<br>
So, the original set had k*(k-1)/2     2-element subsets, and we’re adding k new such subsets:<br>
k*(k-1)/2 + k</h1>
<h1>k*(k-1)/2 + 2k/2</h1>
<h1>[k*(k-1) + 2k ] / 2</h1>
<h1>[k*(k-1) + k*(2)] / 2<br>
notice the parts in “( )”</h1>
<h1>k * [(k-1)+(2)] ___ / 2</h1>
<h1>k * (k+1) / 2<br>
and since the new set has “k+1” elements (let’s call this j, j=k+1)</h1>
<p>(j * (j-1)) / 2</p>
<p>QED</p>

            <p>A little hint: You want to find the number of subsets of cardinality 2 in a set M of n+1 elements.<br>
Choose an element x \in M. Now you know that the number of subsets of M of two elements is equal to the number of subsets of M{x} of two elements plus the number of subsets of M of two elements where one of the elements is x.</p>

            <p>ah well, alright.<br>
an idea how to start the induction step would be enough, I don’t want you to solve the whole thing, I just need some help how to start.</p>
