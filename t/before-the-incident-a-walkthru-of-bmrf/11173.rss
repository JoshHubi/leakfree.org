    <title>Before The Incident (a walkthru of BMRF)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/before-the-incident-a-walkthru-of-bmrf/11173</link>
    <description>I was thinking it would be cool that when you finish the game, you could go back and walk all the levels as if you had arrived long before the incident occurred walking every floor, room, nook and cranny just exploring and speaking with the scientist to gain a new perspective of BMRF and get more back story. There would be no fighting. Just some puzzles and all the rooms would be open.


What does everyone think?

P.S. Prop to the dev team, this is awesome in so many ways. I love the game and the soundtrack is perfect! props all around. A+++++++</description>

            <p>With access to every sector and security level in the entirety of Black Mesa?</p>
<p>I could see taking some time out of my clearly busy schedule (laugh) to do something like this. It may not be amazing or anything, but it’s be something to work on and some good practice with hammer.</p>

            <p>As far as I understood, it would be impossible story-wise, because it seems like Gordon Freeman never been to those areas before the incident. An officer of security at the airlock says that he can’t let me through it, so I think Gordon Freeman is not allowed to be there anyway.</p>

            <p>It’s not gonna happen:<br>
it would be really time consuming!<br>
Now devs have other priorities:<br>
Steam intergration, bug fixing &amp; Xen.</p>
<p>Maybe they could create a SFM video after the credits…</p>

            <p>lol nice idea. but 0% chance to happen… would be a huge amount of work vs. no gameplay value, just for walking in a facility populated by scientists and guards…</p>
