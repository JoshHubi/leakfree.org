    <description>I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I played the original Half-Life a lot. I&#39;d say I had the most fun playing the Hazard Course [s]which is why I think your remake is pure evil[/s] and I had a lot of fun playing around with cheats after I finished the game without them. It&#39;s a really good game. Anyone else have memories like these?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For some reason, I have a really fond memory of fighting the Nihilanth in GoldSrc Half-Life. It took me an hour to actually beat him, and while I was fighting, I was also talking to my then-best friend over Skype and all-in-all I was having a heck of a time.<br>
Also playing Half-Life’s multiplayer on an oddly active server (considering it was like, 2013) was really fun. I’ve always loved ratmaps, and this server had a rotation of them. I remember playing CS: Condition Zero when I was like, 11, in a game shop, driving around in a giant pencil car. It was a fun time. I’m glad that I’m able to appreciate older games like that despite mostly growing up with the Gamecube and Wii.</p>
<p>If HL2 counts too, I have a really strange one.<br>
I was sick with an awful flu, and had a nasty sore throat. So to pass the time, I was playing Half-Life 2 while drinking a warm drink, and for some reason, the memory of fighting the Hunter Chopper in Route Kanal and making my way down to Black Mesa East really sticks in my mind. Despite being sick, i really enjoyed that night. I don’t know why, but I always have the most vivid memories from when I’m sick.</p>
<p>All-in-all I’d say Half-Life has had a super positive impact on my life.</p>

<p>First FPS was Maze War from 1974. It gave you points for shooting each other in a maze. Either that or some game called Spasim, and while it was first person, it was a space shooter.</p>

            <p>I got into Half-Life when I got kind of pissed off when Counter-Strike didn’t have some sort of campaign to play. Course, I was just a kid back then and I thought CS was the base for Half-Life when we all know that it’s the other way around.</p>
<p>That first zombie in the game just scared the hell out of me and I didn’t play HL again for a few months afterwards.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If I recall, the first mention of a violent video game would be Death Race in the arcade. Of course, a lot will agree that the likes of Wolf3D, Doom, and Quake just pushed the FPS genre to mainstream, but of course they are not the first with such ideas. You could even agree that without those games, the likes of 3Dfx and the graphics card race might not have even happened. Damn do I feel old already.  8|</p>

I was just saying that Wolf3D was closer to the true beginning because DOOM wouldn’t exist without it.</p>

<p>The invention of first person shooters happened way before any console HALO game, that recognition belongs to Maze War from '73.</p>
<p>But any self respecting gamer would say that 1993’s DOOM was the true beginning.</p>

            <p>I think my <span class="bbcode-i">earliest</span> memory of the game was watching my brother play On A Rail, and how he snuck past the Apache to get into the explosives-wired room at the missile launch center.<br>
Obviously that memory is super garbled, since no such Apache exists at that point in the game. My guess is that he died when I wasn’t looking and the game loaded a save from a previous playthrough that happened to be in ST. Or I just imagined the entire thing.</p>
<p>For some reason my fondest memory of the game at the moment is that stretch of hall in OaR with the turrets and the bullsquid closet. Not sure why - maybe just because it’s something I haven’t seen in quite some time, since BM cut that part?</p>

<p>I think Halo is a pretty cool guy. eh kills aliens and doesn’t afraid of anything.</p>
<p>Best HL memory was probably Surface Tension, letting the HECU and Xenians duke it out and watching the chaos ensue.</p>
<p>Best HL2 memory was probably the Strider battle in Follow Freeman. I have no idea why I particularly like that battle. I guess it was always just memorable for me, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Best Halo memory was either the opening battle of The Silent Cartographer, the opening cutscene of The Maw, or the Warthog run at the end and the final cutscene… <span class="bbcode-i">oh wait</span></p>

            <p>In our family, we have a tradition of opening one present on Christmas Eve, and Half-Life was mine. I remember staying up to 11:30 playing through to We’ve Got Hostiles, but far and away my favorite area was Office Complex.</p>

            <p>I still remember the first time I played HL1 (although I started the franchise with HL2EP2). It was like nothing I’ve ever player, and definitely had the feeling of a 90s game to it.</p>
<p>The most memorable part of the game was Xen for me. It was so unique and interesting, just like everything else in the game. Still love it to this day. Another memorable part would be On a Rail. In my first playthrough I spent 4days running in circles until I got angry and started shooting everything, when I realized the signs actually move.</p>
<p>But not only that. It was one of the few games I remembered in almost their entirety after just one playthrough.</p>

            <p>tough question, that was a long time ago…but still I can remember the first time I obtained the crowbar and killed the first headcrab with it - it was in HL Upling …I played the original game some time later…I think one of the most fond memories I have from the very first gameplay,  were the disaster Gordon made in UC level after he wokes up and  the silo with tentacles in Blast pit level…</p>

            <p>I think the part that won Half-Life a special place in my heart was during the Resonance Cascade where shit went down, son…then suddenly the screen went black and all you could hear is Gordon’s heavy breathing.</p>
<p>It still gives me chills to this day how well that was done.</p>
