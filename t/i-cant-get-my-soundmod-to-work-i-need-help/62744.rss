    <title>I can&#39;t get my soundmod to work. I need help!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-cant-get-my-soundmod-to-work-i-need-help/62744</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on a soundmod for Black Mesa that&#39;s supposed to replace some weapon sounds. I can&#39;t get it to work for some reason, even though i have made the sounds in the correct format (I have tried both .wav and .ogg with 44100 Hz). I have tried uploading it to the steam workshop and subscribing to it but to no avail.

What am i doing wrong?</description>

            <p>Try “snd_restart” in the developers console(without quotation marks) it resets the sounds so mods work.</p>
