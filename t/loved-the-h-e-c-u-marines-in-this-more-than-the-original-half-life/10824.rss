    <title>Loved the H.E.C.U Marines in this more than the original half life</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/loved-the-h-e-c-u-marines-in-this-more-than-the-original-half-life/10824</link>
    <description>I know some people here dislike how powerful the marines were but me and my friends loved it. I mean sure the Xen aliens were pretty tough but they&#39;re fighting the military, the best of the best, highly trained professional soldiers. Only reason why gordon wins against them is because hes the main character.

I had always hated how useless the army is in some movies/games so its good to finally see our military kicking some alien butt. Really loved how the marines in black mesa wins most of the battle. To me the Xen aliens weren&#39;t even that powerful of a alien race anyway. 

I do agree with some people that there should be more xen aliens in the game, especially alien grunts but please don&#39;t start making the marine side lose, i would still like to see them kick ass. I hope in the next game Xen, there would be some marine squads invading the alien world, losing some battles but also winning some of course.

Loved Black Mesa as much as the original already, for a free game it beats a lot of 60 dollar games out there. Can&#39;t wait for xen!</description>

<p>Mr. Someguy where can I download this hecu skin pack you showed on screenshot with nigtvision googles for hecu etc. ?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The skin is <a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/121683" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">these two</a> with <a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/121386" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this pack</a>. The pack is outdated, there’s a version with up to <a href="https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/124192" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">5 skins</a> out now, but that’s the one I was using at the time of that screenshot.</p>
<p>I should clarify that the skin doesn’t have anything to do with whether NVG’s will show up or not. If you want NVG’s on stock BM grunts and don’t want to change anything, then copy the below text into your <span class="bbcode-i">character_manifest</span> under the <span class="bbcode-i">npc_human_grunt</span>. If you have anymore questions you can PM me so we don’t derail this.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it’s an RPG. The Grenadiers in Black Mesa just have an RPG with 1 shot. They’ll fire it at the first enemy they see, or on scripted sequences, then they’ll take out an MP5, load it, and start shooting.</p>
<p>I do miss the actual grenadiers, it annoys me that everyone has a Grenade Launcher and nobody uses it. I just assume that they used all their Grenades by the time we fight them, or that some of the booms in ST are from GL’s.</p>

            <p>Still hate that you only see them use the mp5 grenade 2 times. (for the people who don’t know look at the first garg battle and how you lose the tram). It added a sense of fear knowing that that grunt over there could hit you in the face with a explosive if he so dared.</p>

<p>According to the wiki, BM’s programmers also added a feature that the marines can throw grenades back but removed due to realism.</p>

<p>I thought this and Soldiers kicking Grenades away were both removed because more often than not the AI was very bad at judgement and just got themselves killed when they wouldn’t have if they just ran?</p>

<p>I don’t like how the grunts will run up to the player and stay there while they empty rounds into you, the grunts know that Freeman is armed and dangerous, so they should be hiding and shooting from behind cover whenever they can</p>

<p>Yeah but Gordon dies very easily when you have a whole squad unloading on him at once. Gordon’s advantage is supposed to be his intelligence, singling out targets, or ambushing them, etc. They probably know that the HEV will fail if they put enough fire into it.</p>
<p>Honestly, if the Grunts acted like this in WGH, I’d need a new strategy to deal with them. My current one pretty much plays on the fact that they don’t support each other very well and like to bunch up in doorways whilst ignoring live grenades at their feet.</p>

            <p>In BM, the commanders are like just special type of hgrunts that wear different gear but still like an ordinary hgrunts. Theirs really signify that they really are leaders by giving commands by hand signals.</p>
<p>Also I like what they did to the houndeyes. No offense but in BM, they may be in packs but they still act like individuals.</p>

            <p>Wow, that looks really incredible. That’s how they <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be in the game, not the currently poor AI iteration (with all respect to the BM team, I’m sorry but it’s shocking).</p>

<p>Oh, I thought that was only to certain modders who wanted to make a mod of BM, rather than modify BM. And that was just something I assumed, not something I actually read.</p>
