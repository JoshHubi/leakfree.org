    <description>This thread is about stuff that pleasantly surprised you today!

So, go ahead and post stuff that surprised you in a positive way!



I&#39;ll start:

Apparently I still had BB King&#39;s Ultimate Collection in my CD tray of my computer, it had been in there for quite a while (at least a month or two) but I forgot about it (I was actually looking for it a few weeks ago).

Anyway, In decided to play Half-Life (again) and was pleasantly surprised when, instead of the HL soundtrack, I hear some kickass blues. Pro-thing to start the day with!</description>
