    <title>I&#39;ve had enough of this onboard crap card.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ive-had-enough-of-this-onboard-crap-card/8359</link>
    <description>Well as the title suggests I am tired of this onboard card and I&#39;m getting a quick fix, there will be no &quot;backing out and waiting for a batter build&quot; so don&#39;t try and make me change my mind to wait and save for a $600 Gaming rig or a better GPU.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking at:
[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131440&#39;]Radeon HD 6670[/url] - $70 From what I&#39;ve seen a minimum of 400W is required, but I&#39;ve used the newegg PSU guesstimator thingamabob (The PSU wattage suggestor) and they suggest a 309W PSU. But If I do upgrade my PSU I&#39;ll have to get a cheaper card. My current PSU is a factory default Dell Inspiron 518 and I&#39;m 99% sure it&#39;s 300W.

or

[url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=14-127-584&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=-1&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=#scrollFullInfo&#39;]Radeon HD 6450[/url] - $50, $40 after rebate - I heard it has a minimum of 400W also, but I also heard that it may work with my default 300W(I&#39;m not going to risk it though) so I guess a new PSU is unavoidable.

I plan on selling Battlefield 3 and Halo anniversary so I should get around $70(not at gamestop) as much as I love my limited edition copy.

Please not I have picked cards with fans as I don&#39;t think my PC&#39;s default fan is good enough.

Do you think there are better cards available at this price and that can support a 400W to 500W PSU, I know I&#39;m being cheap and I know it won&#39;t be good for dedicated gaming, overheats, ect. This is just an upgrade from an onboard, I can&#39;t take this onboard anymore. It&#39;s holding me back from enjoying all my favorite games. My bro wan&#39;t me to play DCU with him and my onboard is crap, EVE Online has updated and my onboard is now obsolete, I have to change any source game to -dxlevel 80 so it will play properly, I can&#39;t even play newer source games like l4d, l4d2, and Portal 2.  

TL;DR
Time to face the facts my pc is a pile of shit, and it&#39;s time to upgrade. I can&#39;t afford a new PC now or in the foreseeable near-future (1 or 2 years). So I am only upgrading my GFX card and PSU.</description>

            <p>The important thing is the Certified Level printed on the PSU. Look at the PSU and look for anything that reads 90, 95, 99 or 100.</p>
<p>That’s a percentage that the PSU guarantees to deliver no matter what.</p>
<p>If you have a 450W PSU with just 90% rating, then it will only guarantee 405 W. If your graphics card needs 400W and the rest of your rig needs 100, then obviously you’re screwed.</p>
<p>Please first check what power does your motherboard, your hard drive(s?) etc. need.</p>
<p>Let us know how much does your RIG need, and then it will limit what GPU you can get.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that’s what I was thinking.  But, from customer reviews I’ve heard that it runs fine even on a 350w PSU. So I think I should be fine, I’m thinking 400w is just a safety measure to ensure an effective and long lasting Graphics Card life.</p>

            <p>One thing, the recommended power supply for that card is 400W and you’re getting a 450. Not sure how these things work but that seems like cutting it kind of close.</p>

            <p>On-board graphic cards are AWESOME!</p>
<p>My Laptop’s specs are easily high enough to run Crysis 2 on recommended settings, but due to my on-board graphics card I struggle to run games from 2000.<br>
Of course, when I bought this laptop I had decided that I wouldn’t be playing games on it, I would be using it for work and occasionally watching movies.  I had my ‘hard work ethics’ hat on.<br>
Several months later I had thrown away my hard work hat and just wanted to play games on the thing.</p>
<p>I can play WoW due to it’s low demands, but I can only do so on low settings and even then I’m lucky to get above 20fps.</p>
<p>This is what most people see…  (at this resolution I get 1 frame every 5 seconds)<br>

<p>Ouch man, I think my onboard is only a little-bit newer (G31/33 Express Chipset)<br>
but it performs a bit better than that one(from what I’ve seen on youtube at least), I’m no expert ,but If you have the money to then I suggest do what they say and build one from scratch here: <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">PC Part Picker</a>. That website makes the process alot smoother and easier.</p>
<p>So, how much do you have for your build? If you don’t have much like me you could just build it part by part starting with the PSU, or you could go the other way and just save up, doesn’t make a huge difference.</p>

<p>Electricity doesn’t like being treated like a bitch, and it can potentially take out your other components in the event of an overload.<br>
Get a slammin’ PSU that will hold you over for future upgrades.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn’t mean all onboards. Just mine, I’ve actually seen some onboards capable of playing Arma II, Battlefield 3, and even Skyrim with okay settings and decent speeds.</p>
<p>Also I guess I’ll try to start with a good PSU then work my way up.</p>
<p>These seem ok right?</p>

<p>oh no. Just don’t go cheapgoat on the psu. Sometimes the wattage promised is no way close to what you actually get. I just can’t stress this enough: Get a decent psu, and you can add shit later. I’m guessing your economy just doesn’t allow a good rig so…There are a number of good advices here right now so…start with the backbone and work your way out.</p>

            <p>If you can afford it you can find 6750’s for around $85 (although this is after mail in rebates from what I’ve seen) and they run on 450W PSUs. They would be much better than a 6670 for not much more money.</p>
<p>Also, as far as PSUs go, do <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> simply get the cheapest you can find. Try to find actual reviews of them and buy name brand. I’ve had my motherboard fried by a cheap PSU in the past and learned this lesson the hard way. Also, make sure that your case takes ATX PSUs. Some Dells use proprietary PSUs and won’t take the standard ATX ones.</p>

            <p>Well as the title suggests I am tired of this onboard card and I’m getting a quick fix, there will be no “backing out and waiting for a batter build” so don’t try and make me change my mind to wait and save for a $600 Gaming rig or a better GPU.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m looking at:<br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814131440" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Radeon HD 6670</a> - $70 From what I’ve seen a minimum of 400W is required, but I’ve used the newegg PSU guesstimator thingamabob (The PSU wattage suggestor) and they suggest a 309W PSU. But If I do upgrade my PSU I’ll have to get a cheaper card. My current PSU is a factory default Dell Inspiron 518 and I’m 99% sure it’s 300W.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=14-127-584&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=-1&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=#scrollFullInfo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Radeon HD 6450</a> - $50, $40 after rebate - I heard it has a minimum of 400W also, but I also heard that it may work with my default 300W(I’m not going to risk it though) so I guess a new PSU is unavoidable.</p>
<p>I plan on selling Battlefield 3 and Halo anniversary so I should get around $70(not at gamestop) as much as I love my limited edition copy.</p>
<p>Please not I have picked cards with fans as I don’t think my PC’s default fan is good enough.</p>
<p>Do you think there are better cards available at this price and that can support a 400W to 500W PSU, I know I’m being cheap and I know it won’t be good for dedicated gaming, overheats, ect. This is just an upgrade from an onboard, I can’t take this onboard anymore. It’s holding me back from enjoying all my favorite games. My bro wan’t me to play DCU with him and my onboard is crap, EVE Online has updated and my onboard is now obsolete, I have to change any source game to -dxlevel 80 so it will play properly, I can’t even play newer source games like l4d, l4d2, and Portal 2.</p>
<p>TL;DR<br>
Time to face the facts my pc is a pile of shit, and it’s time to upgrade. I can’t afford a new PC now or in the foreseeable near-future (1 or 2 years). So I am only upgrading my GFX card and PSU.</p>
