    <title>Office Complex crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/office-complex-crash/62660</link>
    <description>The game crashes when I try to load the chapter Office Complex. This happens both when entering from a save game, or from a new game (starting new game from Office Complex). I have tried the fix from a few years ago (turn down shadow quality) but that didn&#39;t work.

I would attach the .dmp files, but the editor won&#39;t let me...


Also, for some reason I can&#39;t add this to in-game bugs, get the error &quot;This topic has tags not allowed by this category: &#39;&#39;&quot;, so I guess this is both website and in game now...

Edit: So, I just tried skipping that chapter, and the crash happens with &quot;We&#39;ve got Hostiles&quot; as well</description>

            <p>I know this is the official Black Mesa forums, however the dev team usually hangs out over at the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/">Steam </a> forums as well as <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/592595839600558080/592595840040828940">Discord </a>.</p>
<p>If you are looking to report issues with the game, you are best to report them at either of those locations.</p>
