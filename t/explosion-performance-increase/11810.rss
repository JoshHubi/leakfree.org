    <title>Explosion Performance Increase</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/explosion-performance-increase/11810</link>
    <description>Has anyone ever noticed that when in-game when either the mortors explode or a tanks main gun fires, that frame rate for the most part takes a nose dive. I can run Black mesa around 35-40 FPS, but when these instances occure my fps goes down 2-3. Which brings me to this thread...is there anyone who can rework the partical effects for those explosions so their less taxing on those of us with less powerfull rigs?</description>
