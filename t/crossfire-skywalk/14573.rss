    <description>Sorry if this was already posted before, but i couldn&#39;t find a thread about it.

On crosssfire you can skywalk by using the tau jump and be able to shoot down both areas, here&#39;s a video:

It would also be nice if the sky was higher like the original, to escape from the nuke.</description>

<p>The nuke may be divisive (even some members of the team really don’t like it), but it’s part of what makes Crossfire…Crossfire. I don’t think many would argue it destroys the pacing of the level. It sets the pacing of the entire level, in fact. The fighting in the main courtyard, the dramatic shift and mass migration towards the bunker, the short downtime following the nuke as everyone picks up the pieces. That’s a pace setter, not killer. Whether you like the pace or not is an entirely different matter, but we’d never get rid of that because it’s pretty core to the identity of Crossfire.</p>

<p>That will definitely not be removed since it’s in HL1 and is map specific. While BM is not a 1:1 remake, but a re-imagining of the original, this would surely not be something wise to do. You’ll have to get used to it in this case.</p>
