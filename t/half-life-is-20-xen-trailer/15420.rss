Happy Birthday Half-Life! We’d like to thank Valve for creating this masterpiece; an important part of gaming history. Nobody on this team would be where they are today if it weren’t for this amazing, inspirational game. We are lucky to share in a tiny bit of their legacy.

[b]The Xen Trailer[/b]

[i]“The Specimen will be delivered to you in a few (months)”[/i]

To Celebrate Half-Life’s 20th Anniversary, we have something special to share. [b]Our first trailer for Xen![/b] Be sure to go full screen and crank it up to 11!

[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCah8NTcZ1Ct5ElESx5cQRlQ&#39;]James McVinnie[/url] has once again done an amazing job with presenting our game. Everything in the trailer was captured in-game, and we hope to polish and improve our visuals as we get the entirety of Xen up to our standards.

[i]“Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late.”[/i]

Our goal is to release Xen on Steam in Q2 2019. This will allow us to finish Xen to a place where the entire product is stable, smooth, and most importantly...fun! We are already happy with the design state of Xen as it stands currently: [i]almost [/i]everything is design locked and functioning as intended. We are going to be using the remaining time between now and launch to bring it up to our art and polish standards.

Playtests show that all of [b][u]Xen will take roughly 6 hours to complete[/u][/b]; longer for those who like to explore. The levels and design for Xen are largely original work (with cues taken from Half-Life), rather than just simply a remake of  Xen.

We are extremely proud of what we have created, and will be showing off some of our deep graphics and NPC changes later in December, as well as a breakdown of where each of the chapters stand.

[b]Thank You[/b]

[i]“Thanks, Doc.”[/i]

As always, thank you to our incredible community. The positivity and support is what keeps this team going. I got to go the Retro Game Con here in Syracuse, New York, and it was amazing to meet people who have stuck by our game since the mod days. I really cannot express how it made me feel to have people come up to our table and thank us for our work, and encourage us to keep going. Retro Game Con was a great reminder of just how supportive and positive our community is. Let’s keep that going, not just on Steam or the internet, but everywhere!

[img]/uploads/default/original/2X/f/f574694879c5768c546189ca7a574ce57ecbcfc4.jpeg[/img]

Again… a huge thank you to all our fans who have stuck by us through all these years.

[b]Xen [i]WILL [/i]be out in 2019, Half-Life will turn 21, and we can finally buy it that beer we owed it.[/b]</description>

            <p>Bro, you only read the part that upsets you. That purely and entirely universally accepted fact as it is, it wasn’t the whole message nor was the message itself a list of reasons. Like, same as your “Dev members dont post here anymore”, well you is a dev and you clearly posted here, right? ^^ I mean bro (or is u a girl?), isn’t it implicitly obvious that if there’s no updates to a game, then people stop following. Just not really helpful to have sh*t admins in a project you want to succeed, no? ^^</p>
<p>Btw, you gotta press <em>Reply</em> to reply. Otherwise there’s no notification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Its posts like these that make me glad I quit admining the FB page years ago. )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh! Again! Ummm… yyou saying it <em>was</em> the tech-unsavvy admin after all…no I’m kidding. ^^</p>
<p>E: By the way, I think the "I don’t want to click on a link"er might have been a developer… umm. Your name’s vaguely familiar, that’s all I recall. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Lol Bro. I was on this forum in december 2005, when a guy named Raminator essentially ran this place. He was abrasive and snarky. There was some nemesis dude named MGA and they fought these epic troll battles.  In those days, members would troll other members about secret betas, inside release or content info and general shenanigans.  You’re lucky the admin even replied in a PM. back in the day they would have replied with a trash talking shitpost.</p>

            <p>Cuz it has nothing to do with the fact that the dev members dont post here anymore, that the main website no longer points people to this community, that the forums underwent radical changes multiple times over the last handful of years, or that fans simply have moved on to the latest and greatest technology to chat and interact.  Yeah… it was “unbelievably tech-unsavvy admin” that drove away people.</p>

            <p>I mean I was once a member of this forum, long time ago, back when Black Mesa Source just came out, and this forum had this unbelievably tech-unsavvy admin, a total noob, new to internet, and I posted this patch that made the physics in Black Mesa Source more like HL1 or something (made by someone individually I don’t recall), but this guy, giving no reason whatsoever just kept banning my thread. Finally he replied in PM that he will not click on my link. I don’t know, he was super scared, he thought it was 1998 and his IE 4 was going to get a virus or something.</p>
<p>So I mean, I’m mixed, I’m both happy and sad seeing the forum’s demise due to scared and unskilled people like this put into positions they can’t handle. The game itself was great work so… lil’ sad.</p>

            <p>If you own the game, the first two Xen chapters (“Xen” and “Gonarch’s Lair”) are out for beta testing. Just right-click on “Black Mesa” in your Steam library, click Properties, and opt into the public beta on the Betas tab. I think the next chapter, Interloper, is on its way to public beta pretty soon as well.</p>

<p>No clue what you mean by the tank in forget about freeman. The tank is still there and still blows open the door it is just not under player control.</p>
<p>Would be nice to get to control the tanks turret during that but woudl be a a lot of work for a single event when they are focusing on Xen, psot xen maybe we can hope.</p>

</aside>
<p>I actually took the time to refresh my memory and funnily enough there is no door!</p>
<p>But the Abrams Tank is only a static prop with a button that trigger an event sequence that funnily enough we both think it should blow a door open to allow you to progress <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> In reality this is a bit of a weird part in the original game seems a bit half thought out in Half life.</p>
<p>Anyway I also now remember that Xen Turret manned by the Alien Grunt… I think it was out of place in this part of the game somewhat but I wonder if it did indeed influence an alien turret for the xen levels? if not, it’s not a big deal but having seen the xen trailer It has made me wonder about what is going to happen.</p>
<p>I remember talk about certain parts that would be updated along with Xens completed design such as the Xen flora &amp; fauna room in questionable ethics and the Xen cutscene In Test Chamber from the disaster. So there will be some updates pertaining to Xen I would imagine in at least these 2 circumstances  as a given because they we’re clearly sighted as a “To Do” Once design was locked because they did not know what Xen really looked like at this time or it just was not good enough.</p>
<p>Xen looks so Good I have a funny feeling or a hopeful feeling there is quite a lot we don’t know going on behind the scenes.</p>

            <p>Actually both the bullsquid eating and A-grunt opening doors are in the game, the opening doors is used on the big blast doors bellow the ladder you have to go through to access the lambda core area, it is rarely noticed in the fight do to the fact to enemies spawn on the oposite side just before it does that.</p>
<p>As for the bullsquid, eating a scientist that is used in a few locations in the blast pit the thing is unless you are being slow most people will not notice them.</p>
<p>No clue what you mean by the tank in forget about freeman. The tank is still there and still blows open the door it is just not under player control.</p>
<p>Would be nice to get to control the tanks turret during that but woudl be a a lot of work for a single event when they are focusing on Xen, psot xen maybe we can hope.</p>
<p>Also the missing part for We got hostiles, you mean teh vent maze, there is a mod to return that. I hope they bring it back some what as obvious side paths. But yeah don’t hold your breath. I think there is an earthbound discussion topic that might be good to view in general.</p>

            <p>Well done just saw the Xen trailer today… Been quite a while since I came around this forum.</p>
<p>It’s very nice looking what you have achieved for xen, I really like the color schemes and the bioluminessence alien feel.</p>
<p>I have not full info of what has gone on for the last few years actually since pre-release retail version as I was not following and planning on waiting for the finished retail product.</p>
<p>Where did the test chamber go from the forum?</p>
<p>Is it just xen update or are some of the small things missing outside of uncut included? For instance NPC’s who have animations for parts like bullsquid eating scientist… Or Abrams Tank in Forget about Freeman. The Xen Soldier who slides the door apart. The animations are there If I remember somewhat correctly but it was left out sadly. Missing part from We got Hostiles Small Fry all of these I know and in no way ungreatful but it would be good to “Complete” these small things outside the uncut workshop maps. Oh yeah Tentacle in the Desert also…</p>
<p>It’s taken a long time to get to a loose 6 months left to finish but if you can totally complete this thing I think it will be an amazing achiement and some. I am not disappointed but it feels close that it is all pretty much there now surely.</p>
<p>anyway good luck with the final stretch of the development I will look forward to some further news.</p>
<p>I know it’s hard work but yeah just wanting it all to be there somewhat for nostalgia sake but also remix like ypu have or remaster.</p>

<p>It’s a new song from Joel Nielsen, made for the trailer. He’s doing all the Xen music/sound, as always. It could never have been anyone else!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Awesome! Seeing as the song was made specifically for the trailer and isn’t featured anywhere else in Xen, do you reckon that there is a chance that he will upload this track to his YouTube channel or website sometime in the future? I’d love to have a version without the trailer’s SFX!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>According to Joel’s Facebook page, the track will be added to the soundtrack on release.</p>

            <p>I really like what I’ve seen so far. It looks a lot more interesting and varied than the original levels were - well worth the wait in my opinion. Keep up the great work!</p>

When the tentacle impales the bullsquid at 1:04, the illumination of the area changes. Some green fog gets applied to the level.</p>

<p>In Half-Life’s Xen, Valve expanded the range of headcrab enemies to showcase their life cycle (babies and Gonarch). This may be something similar, as the exploding houndeyes look quite small and the knockback houndeye is about the size of a bullsquid. I guess we’ll find out next spring!</p>

And hah, I didn’t even notice there were two variants shown. Man, it’ll be cool to see multiple types of houndeyes! Can’t wait!</p>

</aside>
<p>Cooler if valve later uses them in another half life game and counts black mesa as canon. But who am I kidding valve no longer makes games.</p>

            <ol>
<li>I almost cried. Fantastic work, everybody. I can’t wait to see the finished product.</li>
<li>That music!   Joel, as always, you are a master. It never ceases to amaze me how good you are at what you do.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>(Though sadly, the song gives me <span class="bbcode-i">Hunt Down the Freeman</span> flashbacks, mostly because of the vocals. When I hear it, part of my brain is seeing that cringe-ass <span class="bbcode-i">HDTF</span> prologue. Solution: Probably to just never watch any part of <span class="bbcode-i">HDTF</span> ever again, and when those Xen levels come out, to play them until the association switches. Those both sound like good ideas anyway.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  )</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Only real criticism: The Gonarch looks kind of…bad. Not graphically bad; stylistically bad. It just doesn’t look much like good ol’ Gonarch to me. It’s mostly the sac; it just looks wrong somehow.</li>
<li>What’s up with those houndeyes? Are they on steroids or something? Not that it’s necessarily a bad thing — honestly, they look pretty cool, and it’s <span class="bbcode-i">dope as hell</span> to see a houndeye going up against a bullsquid! In all, it’s quite exciting to see this houndeye variation. I just hope there will be something in-game that explains/justifies it.</li>
<li>Did I mention that I can’t wait to see the finished product?    Seriously, looking at the environments, the details… I can hardly believe my eyes! Such beauty. This is basically a game unto itself.</li>
