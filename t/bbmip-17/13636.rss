    <description>Thankfully the holidays are over and hopefully there will be more time for BM. While taking a break from the consoles I redid the nitrogen tank model. The polycount increase really helps the prop especially the top portion which screamed low poly to me (a lot).
Comparison shot. Ignore the smoothing errors on the old prop.

            <p>Actually they have all been named and the reason they were done was named. I don’t do this for your approval or anyone else’s. What you say contradicts itself and therefore seems a waste of a post. Thanks for posting how boring you found these 17 Blogs.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m putting these on hold for a while maybe they’ll just stop,</p>

<p>“Fridge: Uncut, now with extra Bonus Fridges, and free Fridge DLC! If you find any bugs in our fridge, be sure to report them so we can ship out a Fridge Patch.”</p>
<p>Really though, I think the fridge is great as it is. It’s probably one of the more interesting things I’ve personally seen in recent BBMIP threads. Call me picky, but I can’t really force myself to be interested in nameless computer consoles and terminals. Of course the improved versions will make the atmosphere in the game phenomenal, but when they don’t have comparison shots, or I’m not looking at them ingame, they all kinda look the same.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m confused by what you mean here. Are you saying that the fridge isn’t an improvement over the older one? Or are you saying that this phenomenon in the thread is interesting?</p>
<p>Because I totally think that all of the models I’ve seen in the shots so far are going to make a <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Very</span></span> noticeable difference in quality in the final black mesa release.</p>

            <p>Ronster that fridge is used in literally one place in the game. Both Brian and the mappers have a million other things to worry about. Brian improved the model a bit and it looks nice. It’s done - that’s about as far as it needs to go. Let’s keep on topic - the models! Brian’s a modeller, fellas. Not a level designer.</p>
<p>Also, that improved ammo crate is a big step up, Brian. Nice one!</p>

<p>Are you opposed to a funky fridge like this or something?</p>
<p>I do think if that fridge is nowhere else in the game then it needs to contrast with the objects next to it color wise. Chrome rimmed / rusty</p>
<p>Old fridges really were this color I quite like this color, it’s a bit daring but it’s also would attract the players eye to get them to open the door.</p>
<p>Or there is also the popular lime green vintage fridge also.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.theorganicprepper.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/How-to-be-chill-without-a-refrigerator.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="354"></p>
<p>or stick with the yellowish one atleast that could look like gone off white. Pastel colors basically but with perhaps a bit of sheen.</p>
<p>Glass shelves? Plastic interior? Grille Shelves?  The inside door shelves texture looks great but the interior of the main fridge looks like it is made of wood.</p>
<p>one more thought but it’s not for you Brian but what about on the door opening a light comes on in the fridge. That is a nice touch if a mapper cares enough to add it in kudos on that one. could be something special that.</p>

            <p>Sorry thought I had mentioned the lockers.</p>
<p>My playtesting turned up another prop that was bugging me. Namely the ammo_crate. It had really harse white highlights/ worn paint, which on a wood box looks very strange. Also found out the handles were at least a scale inch or 2 OFF the sides. All fixed and in game.<br>

            <p>The consoles look excellent. I like the fact that the dials all show no pressure on the console that shows drive failure!</p>

            <p>Love it!</p>
<p>I especially like the “Drive Failure” in what I can only assume is post AM.  Nice little detail!   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It is set as the 2nd texture on the model. I’m not going to worry about it any more for now.</p>

            <p>I apologise, I didn’t think I was going off topic at the time:<br>
The feedback I was responding to was essentially suggesting a cleaner version of the prop texture, the justification for this being that the area itself shouldn’t be abandoned.</p>
<p>EDIT: bkdale86, you said that the fridge is supposed to be beige? I’m wondering if going half and half between the two versions that you’ve shown us will make that more apparent.</p>

            <p>Guys, you’re drifting off topic (again). Discuss the model itself, not the environment it’s in. The location it’s in is a <span class="bbcode-i">decommissioned</span> area of the base.</p>
<p>Farther, remember that everything represented in the screenshots is a <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">work in progress and does not represent the final product.</span></span> Additionally, a screenshot is simply just a still shot of an in-game render and may not properly represent what the product looks like in-game other factor(s) such as lighting on the level, brightness, etc has an effect on how it looks in-game. /rant &amp; mini-mod</p>
<p>TL;DR: You’re drifting off topic, new thread or PMs.</p>
<p>And my apologies for derailing it further.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Let me re-iterate:<br>
<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/18848-Blog-rules/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Check the blog rules before posting.</a>[/size] If you want to continue to ignore the rules, be my guest, but you’re at the mercy of the mods and admins in that case.

<p>Hey again,</p>
<p>As far as i know, gordon freeman’s adventure takes place after a recent failed experiment, so the research facility is not an abandoned place. I cant see any logical point for placing an aged refrigerator (looks much abandoned) in there.<br>
I mean, maybe stained and blood covered, but much cleaner refrigerator could be considered as a replecement for that room.</p>
<p>also, for the color opinion, low saturated lemon color or white color item could be more beliavable and blends firmly.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Except the Black Mesa Research Facility started out as a massive decommissioned missile silo complex. Not all of it has been converted into labs, and much of it is still boarded off even in the original Half-Life that this mod is based on.</p>

<p>Stay on topic. I have zero to do with the rest of the room, you wan to discuss that start another thread. This about the model. Please don’t stray again.</p>
<p>Interestingly the frig is the same color as the cabinets, they just read a bit darker.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not about the color of the cabinets, it’s about the detail.  The fridge and the cabinets are the same color but the fridge has details that make it looks as if it’s aging and dirty. The cabinets on the other hand lack detail so they end up looking too clean.</p>

            <p>I also prefer the second fridge. I think it fits in more. However, the yellow works well too.</p>
