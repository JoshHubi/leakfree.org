    <title>Scientist ties are posessed by an evil entity.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scientist-ties-are-posessed-by-an-evil-entity/13798</link>
    <description>I realise that it is a known issue, but still, way too hillarious to pass by.
Basically, some (not all and not at the same time) scientist ties are spazzing out during certain moments. Whether it is a physics bug or something else, I do not kow.


P.S. Seems to happen when you stand closer to the model, once you get some distance between yourself and the scientist - spazzing stops.</description>

            <p>The ONLY time i’ve seen the ties spaz is when i used the media player keys on my keyboard, for some reason changing the song in winamp with those keys causes a sub-second lagspike if i’m playing a game. When i hit next or previous the ties sort of arch up and vibrate a little then stop just as quick. I have fairly high gfx settings in black mesa, very high textures, high models, medium shadows, forgot if shaders are high or low, 4x AA and 4x anisotropic.</p>

            <p>I imagine that is more to do with FPS fluctuation from moving/zooming rather than the movement/zoom behaviour itself.</p>

            <p>I notice that when you shake the view with the mouse very soft or very quick the ties also can be slower or faster in try to chocke themselves, also the zoom of the suit shakes them.</p>

            <p>Alright.</p>
<p>I decided to fraps it and discovered a direct correlation between your FPS and spazzing ties (albeit it might not be the definite reason).</p>
<p>As long as it is above 40 - everything is fine, which is demonstrated in the first few captures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRpjqjrxENo&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=hRpjqjr … 6xq0Zpli71</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmvlS3P59cw&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71&amp;index=2" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=fmvlS3P … 71&amp;index=2</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucpk3XvE7-k&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71&amp;index=3" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=ucpk3Xv … 71&amp;index=3</a></p>
<p>As soon as it goes below that - spazzfest. Changing distance did nothing as you can see in the last three captures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2ETRfO1ok&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71&amp;index=4" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2ETRf … 71&amp;index=4</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpAgqj8c_lA&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71&amp;index=5" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=mpAgqj8 … 71&amp;index=5</a><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgI8MX0xnTc&amp;index=6&amp;list=PLqv2Udc4gZ9QwFQblX-tiLV6xq0Zpli71" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com/watch?v=MgI8MX0 … 6xq0Zpli71</a></p>
<p>Especially the very last one, where for some bizzare reason, my FPS dropped to 13.</p>

            <p>I have thought about it and indeed, this only happened to me during choreo scenes.<br>
Most notable being the security room (the ‘rutta-rutta-rutta pepperoni pizza’ guard and the butthurt scientist), the spectrometer control room (every scientist except kleiner), Eli Vance and the two sci’s that give you a pep talk before letting you in the test chamber.</p>
<p>The latter’s ties would spazz progressively less violently as I increase the distance between them and the actor, stopping moving altogether at a certain distance.</p>
<p>P.S. 1nsane told me that it is more likely to happen if you tab out. For me, does not make any difference whether I do or do not.</p>

            <p>Can you be more specific - at what moments do they spaz out? Is this just completely random? Only during animated scenes/scripted sequences? Only if they are speaking dialogue, etc…?</p>
<p>I have observed this as well - but only when an NPC is in the middle of an animated sequence (e.g., not during movement, or idle behaviours). Is this the same for you?</p>
