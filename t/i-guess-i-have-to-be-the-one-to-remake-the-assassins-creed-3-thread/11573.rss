<p>Its not that AC3 soundtrack is bad, Lorne Balfe did an ok job. It just wasn’t cooked into the game like Kyd’s soundtrack was.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m a stop you there. I don’t understand why everyone is badmouthing Lorne Balfe all of a sudden. Sure, AC II’s soundtrack was brilliant, the best one of the series by far, but it’s as though everyone’s set the bar so high that nothing can ever hope to reach it.</p>
<p>I thought AC III’s soundtrack was fine. More than that it was actually good. Whereas Brotherhood and Revelations had a few good songs, AC III felt like it had a great overall mix. I can say with certainty that if Balfe had attached his name on all soundtracks after AC II that people would have called all of Kyd’s work rubbish too. I think it’s more a case of selective hearing, by casting all of Kyd’s work in the same light because of one extraordinary success, than judging each piece of work regardless of its author.</p>
<p>I can think of several memorable songs, more so than, say, Revelations.</p>

            <p>I think Achilles mentioned the ceremony in the game once. “We used to have a ceremony for this sort of thing,” but it was a throwaway reference. I miss those too. When I first got a recruit up to the Master Assassin rank, and saw her take the Leap of Faith, I was just like “I’m so proud of you!”</p>
<p>I also miss Kyd’s soundtrack. It’s basically half the series for me because of how fantastic the OST is. Revelations had too much Lorne Balfe in it so I liked it less, then AC3 winds up relying on him for the score.</p>
<p>Apparently he was too busy scoring Borderlands 2 and Darksiders 2 this year to work on Hitman: Absolution or AC3. Disappointing, to be sure.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, did anyone notice how the game seemed to distance itself from the literal assassin’s creed. What happened to the introduction ceremony, the finger cutting, the “nothing is true, everything is permitted” mantra? Why did old man Achilles and Connor piss away Al-mualin’s, Altair’s and Ezio’s legacy?</p>

<p>Isn’t George Washington being saved for an alternate history DLC?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>“Welcome to Assassin’s Creed III’s Tyranny of King Washington – a three-part DLC series exploring an ALTERNATE REALITY in which George Washington goes mad with unlimited power, foregoing Presidency to rule as tyrannical King.”</p>
<p>alternate history to me reads as: has nothing to do with AC3 plot whatsoever. I’m talking about within the context of the game’s plot. I think that alternate reality DLC is just dumb.<br>
…<br>
Oh and I forgot to mention another thing that grinded my gears. Jesper Kyd deserves a lot of credit for setting up the mood when playing the previous games. Remember roaming the streets of Firenze to the sound of “Home in Florence” or the same to “Tour of Venice” in Venice. Getting a tour of Venice from Leonardo while “Back in Venice” in the background. C’mon it was gold. Its not that AC3 soundtrack is bad, Lorne Balfe did an ok job. It just wasn’t cooked into the game like Kyd’s soundtrack was.</p>
<p>Why was there no regular ambient roaming around music for each individual cities? Why couldn’t they use any of the previous game’s soundtracks (licensing issue I guess)? I’ll say it again, Jesper Kyd deserves much credit for making AC what it is.</p>

            <p>Well its half-assed. A general feeling I had throughout the game was that the setting was bland and that I MISS EZIO! (sorry the American Rev. is not up there with the crusades and/or the renaissance) Connor is like a cardboard cut out compared to Ezio. They did such a great job with ezio, you understood him and his credible motives. You also got to see some really tender moments (family being executed/Cristina missions). They try and replicate the character build up with Connor but they just don’t pull it off. Bad voice acting I guess. Connor just seems to be naive the entire game.</p>
<p><em>SPOILERS</em></p>
<p><em>Spoilers</em>: I don’t know why but I expected a twist where GW would pull out an apple and have a near death fight with Connor. I feel like there should of been more on GW’s treachery. I mean Connor was driven by his revenge to kill Charles Lee for burning down his village, but wouldn’t he be as equally motivated to kill GW as well. He did give the order. So why did Connor take his side in the war. Naive much? And on the mind-fuck ME3 minus choice ending, where is Jupiter in all this?</p>

            <p>Would people say its worth it?</p>
<p>I loved AC1, and AC2 was such a vast improvement I loved it even more. They seemed to do exactly what everyone wanted, minus mutliplayer.</p>
<p>Which in turn is why I bought brotherhood. I was skeptical considering it came out so quickly, but the multiplayer excused it. Although the SP was probably a let down tbh.</p>
<p>Then Revelations came along and I just didn’t bother. Within about a year they released 3 games that were practically the same product give or take. It just seemed ludicrous.</p>
<p>So all in all, is the SP campaign boring compared to 2? Is it tedious? Is it full of collectible crap you HAVE to find in order to get the most out of the story? ( I enjoyed finding the parts for that ‘eden video’ only. ) Is it still full of bugs? Is the multiplayer going to last long and is it balanced this time?</p>
<p>Is it as good as AC2? ( I really REALLY enjoyed AC2, GoTY for me, in fact I think it was awarded it? )</p>

<p>Yeah I feel like the ending wasn’t mind-blowing like the other games’ were. The story was such a huge let down for me and I really only got AC3 for the story. Although I do like the fact they didn’t really mention Ezio or Altair that much, I don’t like the fact they didn’t include the creed itself. I feel like they didn’t incorporate the Creed in this game as well as they could have.</p>

            <p>I wish they had just used Splinter Cell’s lockpicking code. It wouldn’t be nearly as tedious. Having to hold two thumbstick positions and rock the right trigger can really fuck up my hands if there’s three or more pins to break.</p>

            <p>Lockpicking blows dick, but you’d best get use to it.  You’re gonna be doing it for plenty of chests and doors.</p>

<p>I like the game so far but I hate the new lockpicking mechanic tho.</p>
<p>Also dat plot twist in the prologue. wowzers.</p>

            <p>I feel like eagle vision isn’t very prominent in AC3 compared to the other games too. And the notoriety system seems a bit odd to me as well</p>

            <p>I’m guessing the “puppeteering” layout gets mostly thrown out on the PC.  They threw it out on consoles in Revelations, and cemented it being gone with AC3 and Liberation.</p>
<p>I need to get to beating this game already, I couldn’t put the first two down until I beat them, but some of the stupid shit they did with this makes me not want to play it.</p>

            <p>Ugh, I’ve been following small bits of AC III gameplay on youtube, just to tide me over until the PC version comes out. Youtube then proceeded to provide a list of recommended videos, one of which told me the name of a character who dies. God dangit internet! I knew I should’ve avoided the videos altogether.</p>
<p>Hopefully they’ll fix some of the bugs for the PC, just 10 more days… anyone else in the same boat?</p>

            <p>The glitches I’ve found were kinda funny. For example, one of the trader’s carts in New York was sideways and freaking out.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think you have to go to [color=’<span class="hashtag">#151515</span>’]a certain inn or whatever to start a liberation mission to get a new recruit. It also kind of bothers be that you have to do several liberation things to get new recruits.</p>

            <p>Well I can’t argue with there being numerous bugs and glitches in the game.  Mostly they are unpolished animation issues, but I’ve enountered bugs which inadvertently reward me for actions I haven’t quite completed (I received a memento at the Manor for exploring all of New York…when I had just only stepped in the city briefly for a story mission).</p>
<p>Currently, I’m in a bit of a pickle (might be spoilers, so black text).</p>
<p>[color=’<span class="hashtag">#151515</span>’]Has anyone actually been able to recruit Jacob Zenger from New York?  I completed all of the liberation objectives for East New York and it said to speak with the district contact, but he is nowhere to be found…in-game or on the map.</p>

            <p>Well I just finished the game, and I’ve got to say, the ending isn’t as good as any of the others IMO, it has a cliffhanger, but it isn’t as “WTF” like the others… Overall, it’s a good game, but I feel like the story doesn’t develop that well.</p>
