            <p>Scenes are missing from the second Garg…In HL1 I remember jumping over a wall via jumppad + Garg bashing in the gates and after that it could actually get in your face at the tower cause it had a ramp or some s<em>it (that was f</em>cking scary - “Look at me, I’m on the tactical map” - turns around sees huge garg head - “WTF??!?!?!” :fffuuu: - falls off )</p>
<p>Too bad that the second Garg was so easy to kill…I dove into the water but it didn’t go after me, it went after the tower <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>As for the red balls of death aka stomp attack…nope, didn’t see it (but honestly it was a silly attack anyhow)</p>

<p>You gotta admit that when you fell out of that vent and saw that Garg you were like OH FUCK! That was an intense moment in gaming for sure. I loved it. Bit hard getting that airstrike in initially though.</p>

<p>I’ve probably played the original Half-Life too much, but that wasn’t quite my reaction. Instead, my reaction was more along the lines of “Oh, so we’re going straight to the part where I run away to the tower and explode it? Didn’t we skip a few steps here?” Admittedly, that’s a very jaded, meta-game view on the subject, but I lost my fear of the Gargantuas a long time ago when I was forced to fight one a fucking unfair fight with a Gargantua on the surface and sea monsters in the dark waters below. Half-Life scared the crap out of me when I was still a kid and I was deathly afraid of situations I couldn’t control, but it also taught me to let myself flow with the game and not fear getting killed.</p>
<p>Also, the reason we don’t remember the foot stomp is it’s kind of a stupid attack that was put in for no reason other than the Gargantua is otherwise no threat if you’re out of each of its flamethrowers. I would have expected a Op4 Worm style eye beam attack. Now THAT would have been scary  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I would actually like to fight the garg with the EGON GUN and stuff.<br>
The second one being gibbed from a single mortar shot was rather underwhelming.</p>

            <p>Yep I can’t believe after all those playthroughs of the original that I could have forgotten that. Then again the last couple days for me have been hell and I’m forgetting alot of stuff.</p>
<p>Very interested to see the Xen approach to Gargs.</p>
<p>I’m also EXTREMELY interested to see how the team handles the Gonarch.</p>

            <p>Maybe they added some stuff. Like triggering some really epic cave-in that crushes the Garg.</p>
<p>One can always imagine…</p>

            <p>^yep</p>
<p>I think we have a couple of Gargs ahead of us in Xen without environmental hazards to use against, so I wondered.</p>

            <p>If by garg stomp you mean that melee attack it uses at close range, no that was not cut. It’s just extremely unlikely that it will use it because it will always get to that distance where it spams that fire attack. I used god mode to run up on it just for the sake of seeing how it would react when I did so. Within a few feet of it they like to stomp, but ordinarily it won’t happen unless you are screwing around. There really isn’t an area-of-effect to it either.</p>
<p>Edit: then again I may have totally forgotten what you mean by a garg stomp regardless of the fact that I’ve played the original multiple times. (Just rewatched the original garg fight on youtube, ignore all my previous statement on this post.)</p>
