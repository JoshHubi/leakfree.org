    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rare-specimen-glitch/10880</link>
    <description>Hello, I don&#39;t know if anyone had an issue with this, but I tried to get the &quot;Rare Specimen&quot; achievement, and it will not activate whatsoever. I about to go into spoilers just to let anyone reading this know, however they lead to my problem so go on if you wish to help.

-------SPOILERS STARTING-------

So I found the hat in the whole teleporting sequence, and I got it to the top. If I should note anything, I did forget to bring the hat on my first time, so I had to jump a fence to get back down to the bottom of the shaft to pick the hat up.
I made my way through the game as normal, getting to the teleporting room and all, stocking up on my gear and getting the long-jump module etc; when finally the whole last part of the game starts.

I proceeded to fight off the Xen enemies as normal, and when the portal was ready I threw the hat in and to my surprise, no achievement popped up. I ignored it, assuming I had to be in Xen to get it (Mind you I was highly unaware of any updates for the game, so I did not know the game did not have Xen ready). 

When the game ended, I decided to reload a save to try and get it again. I jumped in while holding it, and still did not get it; I tried letting go while jumping in, I even sent the hat in only and I died in the portal room, and nothing happened.

----------------SPOILERS END HERE---------------------


That is pretty much it, I ended up coming here to see if I can ask for help from anyone here. I only want to get the achievement since I want to get some stuff done in the game and all, and it really annoyed me how the achievement did not work after all the annoying work getting the dang hat up to the top. 

If anyone has a clue how to fix this, I would be most appreciative for any assistance on how to solve this. Thank you for reading this and have a good day. 

(FYI, I loved the mod. To all the guys and gals who worked on Black Mesa, great job! You have done one hell of a mod!)</description>

</aside>
<p>Ah, well for me I am not about hunting achievements, its just fun to do them when you finish the game and you have plenty of extra things to do. I found another hat which someone mentioned, and the funny thing is I was gonna check the spot I found it in on my first run, but I decided not to after I went down the elevator and the games does not allow you to go back up.</p>
<p>I did not want to load my last save killing all the Assassins again since it was pretty rough as it was on my health. Hopefully bringing this hat to the end will fix my problem.</p>

<p>I was not using any cheats at the time, nor did I even access the dev console; I am gonna try what marcus mentioned and search for a hat in the start, see if I can send it in the start at the start in the test chamber.</p>

<p>Think you have to use the first hat, found earlier in the game, before the core.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>How would that work? Don’t forget you have to get caught by the soldiers and all at “Apprehension”, so how would it transfer over? Or do you mean have the hat teleport with you into Xen at the start when the specimen makes the test chamber go crazy?</p>
