            <p>I see games all the time completely made from scratch not using any existing game engine. That is they either use OpenGL or DirectX and code everything themselves. If there are so many issues with existing game engines why not do this? Especially if what you are making is NOT an FPS. there are also several libraries out there open source for doing various stuff like networking, hit detection, server management etc.</p>
<p>I realize coding all this is a major undertaking but so is getting to grips with a very complex game engine like Source or Unreal. It is not just drag and drop with those engines either. Actually Crytek’s Sandbox editor is more wysiwyg if you need that.</p>

            <p>Honestly, Source has always been a problematic platform.  Especially if you wanted to do something that wasn’t an FPS.  The tools aren’t so hot to begin with.  I’m surprised they haven’t had issues like this before.  The team I’m on still use GldSrc (original HL engine), which we’ve heavily modified to do our bidding  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">   At one point we considered switching to Source, but we woulda had problems, and considering we’re still not done, this issue would have been a problem.  Still, I’m not gonna tar and feather Valve over a mistake like this.  They’ll eventually fix it.  I think the community (modders at large) needs to get off its quid pro quo high horse.  Sure it would be nice if Valve would issue some statement, but hell, it’ll get fixed eventually.</p>

<p>To be fair, I think that was simply a misused term. the impression I got was that Phillip meant to say that it was Valve’s RESPONSIBILITY to keep the source code from being leaked, and yet despite it being entirely Valve’s responsibility, the community still assisted them in tracking down the culprit.</p>
<p>Here, I know this isn’t the issue Phillip is trying to stress. It’s not that “Wah, Valve abandoned their fans” but “Whoa, hey Valve, I know games on Mac is the big thing you’re pushing, but what about the community support that helped propel you to being big enough to spearhead that?”</p>
<p>Phillip never said he was throwing that out. He’s merely pointing out that there’s already a trend in the modding community towards using the Unreal Engine, and that these problems with the Source Engine are only going to push that along.</p>
<p>Keep in mind; PlanetPhillip runs pretty much entirely on new SOURCE mods coming out. There is a certain level of personal investment behind all of this, and Phillip also has a wide group of modders to get an idea of just how severe the problems with the source engine are, or at least how severe their affect is on modders working on high quality mods and also on people just starting.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Fair enough. After reading it again, I think I was too hasty in dismissing what he was saying. The tone of the post rubbed me the wrong way, but I can see where he’s coming from in retrospect.</p>

            <p>This is a little old - from Feb 09 but in this steam post they mention the PC setups they use at Valve. While it only lists specs, it does suggest they don’t stick to an off the shelf PC from any particular supplier. Also if they stick to an 18 month cycle they should have changed again not so long ago.</p>

            <p>Assuming the thanks to Alienware means they had those computers at the time, they would have replaced those systems after all these years – the replacements may also well have been Alienware, but not necessarily.</p>

            <p>They probably have many different computers with all different specs in order to test for compatibility and performance.  It is highly likely that among those is an Alienware, as well as high performance machines from other manufacturers.</p>

            <p>I presume you don’t think they will have Alienware’s because they are so overpriced. But I imagine they do use a few at least, and they will most likely have been given to them by Dell.</p>

<p>Frankly, given Valve’s track record I think it’s safe to assume that both fixes and apologies are on their way. That it hasn’t happened sooner is a disappointment, but it’s not like I’m going to throw out years and years of good will over it. Sheesh.</p>

            <p>I’m sure when Portal 2 and/or Episode 3 come out, the next iteration of the Source engine will solve all these stupid problems.</p>
<p>Wait:  I forget…  Isn’t Portal 2 going to be a new engine?  Source2 or something?  Or is it just going to be another engine upgrade on Source?  Or both (ie: Source2 = major Source upgrade)  If it is a new engine, than wouldn’t new tools be in order?  And then they may never go back to fix any existant problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just lost myself.</p>
<p>Alot of mods weren’t affected by the recent problems, and I can’t seem to figure out what the modders did differently in the mods that were broken and the mods that weren’t.  I heard that using HL2 as the base game instead of the Source SDK or something like that might have done something, but I don’t recall exactly.</p>

            <p>Yes, I agree that Valve screwed the pooch by not acknowledging that their tools have gone to shit, but I can’t really take someone seriously after they flat out say the source code theft was Valve’s fault. Whatever you say, dipshit.</p>
<p>It also reeks of the typical gamer victim mentality of “oh you screwed up once after doing everything right for more than a decade. You must hate us fans now and not care at all.” Again, I can’t take this shit seriously. What a crybaby.</p>
<p>Frankly, given Valve’s track record I think it’s safe to assume that both fixes and apologies are on their way. That it hasn’t happened sooner is a disappointment, but it’s not like I’m going to throw out years and years of good will over it. Sheesh.</p>

            <p>I don’t know what the hell Valve is doing!?! I’ve been seeing posts like this since the beginning of May. Hopefully valve will address these issues soon,  otherwise I don’t know what’s going to happen.</p>

<p>Also, why does this guy think anyone “deserves” an apology. What the fuck does it matter?</p>

            <p>Yeah, they’ll fix it as soon as their Tools team can figure out what’s wrong. I mean, they kinda all have top of the line Alienware computers at Valve last I checked, so it’s not going to necessarily work on all systems when they do a major (and I mean major, they had to overhaul it for macs) update. They forgot to test on a huge variety of computers before releasing, that’s all.</p>

            <p>I’m sure they will fix it. Some drunk from the recent Valve party probably did it ^^ .</p>
