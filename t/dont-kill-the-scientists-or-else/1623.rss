    <title>Dont kill the scientists! OR ELSE!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dont-kill-the-scientists-or-else/1623</link>
    <description>Ok, so you could basically say I am a cool mom cuz I let my 12 year old play half life.  As a matter of fact, he was weened on Half Life cuz I used to have him sit on my lap as a youngun as I quickly and efficiently dispensed with the zombies and vorts and such.  Ah good times!  Such wonderful bonding moments as both of us would get freeked out at the monsters jumping out of everywhere.

I simply do not buy into the &quot;Video games make our children killers!&quot;

However I do have one rule.  He is not allowed to kill the scientists in Half Life.  I still catch him doing it once in a while so now I want to get back at him.

Does anyone have any ideas of how I could implement a &quot;shoot the scientist and you die&quot; or &quot;shoot the scientist and the game reloads&quot; or &quot;shoot a scientist and the damage is done to you instead of the scientist&quot; or like we tried during today&#39;s black mesa chatroom, &quot;shoot a scientist and you engulf in flames till you die or you lose tons of damage&quot; (that didnt work)

Anyone have any ideas?  I know how to mess with the config files, so I think this is how I want to implement it, but I dont know the commands to do it.

Thanks for your help!</description>

            <p>He still screams, but he doesn’t run from the player, he just takes it as enviromental damage.<br>
Also, if the hitbox is (I think the figure was 0.0000001 cubed, give or take a few zeros)<br>
He’s impossible to hit with bullets/energy/crosbow/ect. Just blasts and melee type damage from the crowbar/npcs.<br>
Like I’ve said in the PM, I hope the model works for you. And If he ever finds out that I’m responsible, he’ll probably hate me for a few years, at least.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Right! Like how Sylar moved his only vulnerable spot around using his shape-shifting ability.<br>
If any hitboxes are left, though, the sci <span class="bbcode-i">would</span> still be vulnerable to explosions. Oh well… that’s where tons of health comes into play. It would be very difficult to realize the scientist is being harmed by explosions, and impossible to observe him get hit by bullets with a hitbox the size of a hair.</p>

            <p>It’s a model editing software. If you want, I can try doing it for you, as I already have MS. Low-def, Gearbox HD, or Ambient.Impact HD?<br>
EDIT: PM sent with link. I assumed you’d be using the defaults, but it’s not a big loss in quality if you’re using the Gearbox HD models.</p>

            <p>I’m guessing nobody else has thought of what I’m about to suggest.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I suggest dissipating all of the scientists’ models’ hitboxes.</span> Shots should go right through them. Although this could keep them from being harmed by aliens, that would simply allow your child infinite time to remove whatever is attacking them. Combined with a grossly increased healthpoint via skill-CFG, the scientists should be made immortal to non-scripted deaths.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">(I am reminded of the story of an autistic child who played and enjoyed TFC as a source of rare social interaction, when the mother came to Custom-TFC’s forums for advice on replacing the human gibs due to their violence. I suggested replacing the gib models with an empty/void model, as not to misconstrue random props spawning from a killed human.)</span></p>
<p>Anyway, removing the hitboxes should prove easy enough with a Milkshape decompile, text-edit, and recompile. It <em>might</em> be necessary to specify one hitbox of zero volume to keep it from automatically forming new ones, but I’m not sure if that’s the case, so you’d probably want to try it with none.</p>
<p>And you do have HLMV of course, yes?</p>

            <p>hahaha! no no no.  The changes I want to make are specific to my Half Life game. Not Black Mesa and not anyone elses.  And no I dont think attaching an audio file to a scientist kill would really serve any purpose.  Although that rick rolling thing would be kinda funny.  Specially if when you shoot the scientist it plays the WHOLE Rick Astley song.  hahaha! for 2 minutes he would be writhing in pain.  :chuckle:</p>

            <p>So will this be a feature in Black Mesa? I mean, you could have your voice in there as a hidden audio file and have a console command to turn the feature on and everything.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Or are you not going to even let him play Black Mesa for fear of him finding and murdering every npc you voice?</p>

            <p>Hmm…you could do something crazy like record with FRAPS at horribly low settings while he plays and then review the clip afterward, fast-forwarding to the parts where the guards/scientists are.  Even more Big Brotherish, but it would help you watch over his shoulder most of the time (unless he figured out how to disable it, at which point you could yell at him about that).</p>

I like your idea, though. I’ll be adopting that rule to use with my kids in the future.<br>
I’ll tinker around with Half-Life to see if I can manage anything. I am a programmer, but as far as I know, there’s no way to access the HL sourcecode to modify it and then re-implement it in the game.<br>
But I’ll still try  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Just let him play the game, it’s a definite part of Half-life and by restricting it you’re taking something away from the game.</p>
<p>Besides, after a few times he’ll get bored and just play the game without killing the good guys.</p>

            <p>Here’s what I think you should do:</p>
<p>Watch him as he plays HL.  If he kills a scientist or another “friendly”, slap him up the back of the head (like Gibbs does to Dinozzo and McGee in NCIS).</p>

<p>So, replace the death sounds with duplicates of Never gonna give you up? <span class="bbcode-b">I like it!</span><br>
Of course, you could always tell him the life story of all four scientist models, dropping in similaries to his life so he’ll identify with them more:<br>

            <p>Why don’t you use that mod that if you shoot a scientist they turn into monsters and try to kill you. then just give them infinite health.</p>
<p>Edit: Also when I was 11 and my cousin introduced me to half life, I killed about one scientist then I just got bored and found it pointless and I just went on with the story/campaign, he probably will too if you don’t give him that restriction. Kids love to do what parents tell them not to.</p>
