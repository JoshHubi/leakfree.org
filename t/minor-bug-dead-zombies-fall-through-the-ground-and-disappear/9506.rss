    <title>[minor bug] - dead zombies fall through the ground and disappear</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-bug-dead-zombies-fall-through-the-ground-and-disappear/9506</link>
    <description>Basicly everything that I kill falls through the ground. I will continue testing and see how far that problem goes.

Also another issue: Corpses, not gibs, fade away really fast, like in the censored HL2:EP2 version of the game in germany. Is this intended?

[b]FOUND A FIX![/b]

This is veery strange. I created a temporary Steam account and started Black Mesa up. It&#39;s the same installation of both Black Mesa and The sdk yet no more falling through AND no more fading away when npcs die in scripted sequences. When I switch back to my original account, which has several censored games from Valve(but not installed) the problem occurs again but my other account works perfectly fine. I can reproduce this on my laptop, same result.

[COLOR=&#39;Black&#39;]Srsly, fuck germany and their bullshit censoring of Valve games, because they made CounterStrike. There is not a single fucking uncensored game from Valve. They ruined BM for me.</description>

            <p>Same problem, this really bugs me. I hope we’ll find a better fix for this.<br>
I’m also from germany thought in normal censored games the ragdolls used to just fade away. And here they just don’t clip with anything. Funny enough, the single body parts stay on the floor, so it can’t really be a censor problem.</p>

<p>Also happens to me, the zombies and headcrabs fall though, the houndeye (i have encountered only one so far) stayed on the ground after dying.</p>
