    <description>Hi there  :slight_smile: 

I have a question - how many languages would be avaiable in Black Mesa: Source? I mean, i don&#39;t need it but many fans in Poland (and other coutries) are so exicted about this mod, but they didn&#39;t know english so good.

So - will be there any translations? If no - can i help? I translated some games and i know the deal.</description>
