            <p>as I already said, if you start your engine coding right and use switchable libs and write your own switchable wrappers, then you can easily port the engine over to another OS.<br>
Just look at all those indie projects, the old Unreal and ID Engines.<br>
To switch to platform specific libs without modifying your code every compile you just use [COLOR=‘DeepSkyBlue’]<span class="hashtag">#if</span> defined(_WIN32) for example.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes I know that you would still need a version for each OS. It would still be cheaper and less time consuming to release for multiple operating systems therefore it would be more likely.</p>
<p>You start then moving into driver issues. AMD in particular would need to step up their game in this regard as their open source drivers leave a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Still it’s all hypothetical as it’s unlikely the industry will make the shift any time soon.</p>

<p>Does the Xbox360 use a totally different code to what DirectX and OpenGl is?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Xbox 360 uses a modified version of directx API. Remember also you can’t really directly compare OpenGL and DirectX. DirectX includes various API’s: Direct3D, DirectInput, DirectSound etc etc.</p>
<p>OpenGL is the equivalent to just Direct3D so it’s more complicated to compare them. OpenGL has been able to do tesselation and various other things for a while, M$ have only recently began to implement into Direct3D.</p>
<p>DirectX has become popular because of the massive microsoft PR machine. Open standards have no chance against the marketting muscle of m$.</p>
<p>Microsoft operating systems are also fussy about using openGL so most windows games will be DirectX (again an anti-competitive act by m$).</p>
<p>The most annoying thing about it all is if all developers used open standards then we could see games across all platforms and operating systems. Mac, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD would all be able to run the games.</p>

<p>I’m well aware that you were talking about Valve’s more current games. I wasn’t even talking about Half-Life 2 since quite frankly the game has not gotten better with age, graphically of course.

<p>DirectX10 is only barely a step forward in terms of technical improvements: Remember when someone got Crysis to play on DirectX 9 using the same settings as on DX10? They were both almost identical, with only a slight bit of shadow quality differences. DX10 <span class="bbcode-i">may</span> be suitable as a stepping stone or perhaps even a good PR boost, but that’s about it in terms of worth.</p>
<p>DX11 is simply a much better improvement over 10, and while Valve will have to upgrade eventually, it would make more sense for them to include both instead of just the more archaic one. Even then, at the moment I see no real need for them to upgrade, even to DX11. They might not be cutting-edge in terms of graphical quality, but it has a lot more to do with what they’re willing to implement as opposed to what they have at their disposal.</p>

<p>we need full 100% FPGA cards, then you will be able to “download” harware. as FPGA are on the fly programable chips  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Well… no… If you correctly read my post… I clearly said that it looks better than a TON of DX10 games… NOT all…</p>
<p>Oh, and btw, I’m thinking more like tf2/l4d1+2… not HL2… moron.</p>

<p>Portal 2 looks incredible without the use of advanced features. And considering the fact that it will be released soon, I don’t think they really care if it looks better than great. That just isn’t Valve.</p>

<p>Plus the kind of shapes in Portal don’t really call for tessellation.</p>

<p>I can testifiy to this, my 5770 costs about 130 now and it runs DX11 just fine.</p>
<p>Also tessellation is more than neat, I think it looks great all the time and makes huge improvements.</p>

</aside>
<p>Tesselation doesn’t exist on older DirectX video cards. Parallax mapping helps simulate the process, but is also more expensive performance-wise. We don’t “have a peace of non-overpriced hardware that can run it smoothly” because the function <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t exist on them.</span></p>
<p>It’s not like Microsoft can just implement every technical feature under the sun for just one installment - then you’d just have video cards that’d be horifically expensive, but last a decade or so. At least, hopefully they would - what if you wanted a new card, or if yours broke, or if games started demanding more quality?</p>
<p>And then you’re over-exaggerating the quality of video cards that just come out of the market. DirectX11 won’t be the mainstay for quite a while yet, and the cards that support them have quite a bit of power to back themselves up. You can find a good card that supports DX11 for only about $130 on Newegg. That doesn’t sound like a ripoff at all.</p>

<p>I think that today’s developers run too fast with the “omgawesomenewtech”. The truth is that every new DX brings just slight improvements that often can be replaced with a workaround on an older hardware. To me it’s mainly a marketing scheme, a reason to squeze more money from us… That’s why Valve always used their current tech to it’s maximum potential, that’s why they don’t have to (but also might to fix some more complicated stuff) use DX10/11. Whatever they decide, it’ll be awesome  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, on the technical side, DX9 to DX10 was pretty worthless, sure. But DX11 actually has a good bit of improvements, especially compared to DX9. I direct you to this thread for more details: <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/326.200117-DirectX-11-Zers-overview-of-DX10-vs-DX11?page=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/326.200117-DirectX-11-Zers-overview-of-DX10-vs-DX11?page=1</a></p>
<p>Note that even when not comparing DirectX 11 to all the pretty stuff you see on the screen, it still has other features to make game developers sweat less, I.E., improved multithreading support.</p>
