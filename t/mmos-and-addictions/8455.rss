    <description>Have you ever been addicted to an MMO?
What MMO?
Did you stop playing?
Why?
Would you go back if you could?

I&#39;ll go first.
EVE Online
I stopped because my onboard  gfx card was unsupported after an update.
I will go back soon after my Radeon HD 6670 comes in the mail soon.

FFXI
I ran out of subscription money
I might go back if I had the cash.</description>

</aside>
<p>I just threw “addiction” into the title to attract more people, honestly who would care about a post named “MMO’s”. Addiction adds some sort of interest or mystery to the subject and heats things up.</p>

            <p>I have a friend who’s really addicted to WoW, he regularly sells high level accounts and works the same shitty customer service job since that fucking game came out.</p>
<p>The way I see it, a serious MMO addiction can be worse than a mild drug addiction, at least my addiction requires going outside to the <span class="bbcode-i">real world</span> every once in a while.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy 11 Online.</p>
<p>Started and stopped probably 4 times, each time plugging away 30 days of total play time.</p>
<p>Had to stop because the community died and the ridiculousness of having to HAVE a party to move forward in the game made it impossible to get anywhere. It was all grind and no play.</p>

<p>Like faction wars - I just can never commit to joining a clan or faction or anything like that, because I have a job and a pretty active social life and it would just be too hard to be actively doing raids and wars and stuff all the time. Most clans expect a lot of devotion out of their members, and have all sorts of stupid drama all the time, so there was nothing really left for me to do but the quit the game after that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed, at least for the most part. I keep my char in the noob corp, I don’t feel like joining a clan or faction. I have 2 accounts, 1 flies a Hulk and T3 Cruisers and the other flies a Retriever and I’m training for an Orca. No one can really say I put too much cash into it, because I payed for my second account with in-game PLEX.</p>

            <p>WoW was great when it was new. It was still organic and lots of random stuff happened. I remember a constant back and forth between the Crossroads and Everglade (or what was the name of that nearby Alliance outpost?).</p>
<p>Or that little undead outpost near Undercity. These spontaneous PvP events were so much fun. Battlegrounds were pretty okay too.</p>

            <p>I’m thinking about giving PlanetSide a shot. It’s old but is it good?</p>

            <p>I don’t think I’ve ever been “addicted” to an mmo per se, but I did play Perfect World International, Eve Online, and Global Agenda quite a bit each. I got really into them. But, in each one, once I hit the first really big milestone in the game (PWI - getting TT weapons, Eve - getting a battleship, GA - playing a DDR), I suddenly lost interest. I guess I just realized, after I came down from the elation of the achievement, that things were just going to get harder from there on out, and most endgame content wasn’t going to be something I wanted to do. Like faction wars - I just can never commit to joining a clan or faction or anything like that, because I have a job and a pretty active social life and it would just be too hard to be actively doing raids and wars and stuff all the time. Most clans expect a lot of devotion out of their members, and have all sorts of stupid drama all the time, so there was nothing really left for me to do but the quit the game after that.</p>
<p>I’ll probably pick up TOR and play for a while though, since I have a friend who plays too.</p>

            <p>I played Everquest 2002-2008 and I was addicted to it for a while. It was fun for a long time however I just grew tired of the same tasks such as grouping killing things and turning quests in and them realized I was just kinda wasting time, everyone in a while I get nostalgia to play but after a half an hour or so I realize why I got tired of mmos… I’d like to try Everquest 3 whenever it comes out to</p>

<p>The only MMO that looks promising would be TOR, it looks very cinematic and gameplay looks nice.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’ll be disappointed if you didn’t like WoW.  It’s mostly the same, but with each class having it’s own story.  Plus space combat.  Other than that, it’s pretty much WoW with a Star Wars skin.  The main difference in gameplay between TOR and WoW is, in WoW, as a melee character, (and hunters) you autoattack, where in TOR, your basic attack is not automatic.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, I played WoW from soon after it’s release to soon after the release of the first expansion.  Like, all the time.  I put it down until the second expansion came out, tried to get back into it, and couldn’t, so put it down again.  I’ve been playing for almost a year during the newest expansion, and it feels quite a bit different than when it was new.  Everything is more polished, sure, but it feels lacking compared to 2004-2006.</p>

            <p>The only MMO I’ve ever been able to sit down and play for longer then an hour was Asheron’s Call, and that’s because it’s radically different from other MMOs (and the combat in other MMO’s is much more passive compared to it)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WQCpzY8Yis" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WQCpzY8Yis</a> &lt; here’s a lot of reasons why</p>
<p>GW i played for a while but that was only because it lacked monthly subscription and my friends wanted me to play with them.</p>
<p>I’ve always leaned towards offline games/not massively multiplayer like the entire TES series, Dungeon Master, and Diablo games because I enjoy games more when they emphasize atmosphere which MMO’s don’t really convey as well.</p>
