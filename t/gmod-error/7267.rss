    <title>GMOD ERROR?!?!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gmod-error/7267</link>
    <description>Ok so I know that Garry Newman created a bug to catch Piraters ----
The &quot;Unable to shade normal polygons&quot; bug.

I&#39;ve had the legit version of gmod 10 almost since it came out...
and today I was playing on a server and I got booted off and it said &quot;This steam account does not have this game, please log onto the correct account&quot;

Shortly after that, my gmod closed and said &quot;Unable to shade normal polygons&quot;

I [i][u][b]swear[/b][/u][/i] on my life I didn&#39;t pirate it... 
This is pissing me off so bad because apparently when I searched no one else had this problem.

Is it possible someone could have hacked my steam? Even though I&#39;ve never given any information to anyone?

...Every time I try to get back on gmod now it says Unable to shade normal polygons</description>

            <p>Even if you were hacked, the attacker wouldn’t be able to really ‘steal’ any games from your library, because games can’t be moved to different accounts.</p>
<p>You got two options: Hit up Steam Support for some expert advice, or do a complete re-install and hope it fixes the problem.</p>

            <p>Just to make sure you’re not a pirate, give me a link to your steam page.</p>
