    <title>Notebook advice requested</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/notebook-advice-requested/1931</link>
    <description>Hey folks!

I&#39;m thinking about buying a gaming-capable notebook in the near future since this notebook here is basically just a typewriter I need for Uni stuff and my main Gaming machine is about eight years old (still runs the source games in perfectly acceptable quality, though). I once at least knew my way around hardware types and stuff, but I&#39;m totally out of the loop.
I doesn&#39;t have to be able to run any recent über-graphic titles, if I&#39;ll be able to run them Source games on full with high FPS rates and games about a year old on medium at reasonable FPS rates, that would be totally sufficient.
So, if you could give me some pointers towards what&#39;s good mid-range (and thus affordable) mobile hardware, it would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>Nothing specific, like I said, I’ve been totally out of the loop since I started studying. HDD space is not a problem, I’ve got an external 1TB HDD for photos, music and uni stuff, so I guess any basic HDD with 200GB upwards will do for OS and games. As for RAM, what’s a good ballpark figure these days? I guess two GB or more, seeing as my old machine has one GB.</p>
<p>Also, I’m more willing to get a laptop than a desktop because I’ll be off to England next year for a semester and I’d like to have some videogamed entertainment every now and then during the cold and dark British winter evenings after work.</p>

            <p>Ok, BRB with more searching!<br>
Is there anything specific you now you want?<br>
Say, Intel or AMD, Nvidia versus ATI, how much RAM or HDD space you want, etc.</p>

            <p>I guess I can afford to shell about €500 (which is about $750) on this.</p>
<p>And yeah, that Pavillion looks good, cheers.</p>

            <p>Personally I would go with a new desktop because you can upgrade it, but if you insist on gettin a laptop thats under $1000 I would try this <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834157061" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">one</a>. Its got an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4650, 4GB of DDR3 RAM, and an Intel Core 2 Duo T6600@2.2Ghz.</p>
