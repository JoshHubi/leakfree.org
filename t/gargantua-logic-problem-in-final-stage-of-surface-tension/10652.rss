    <description>My complements on Black Mesa. 10/10.

I have a suggestion for improving a logic issue I started thinking about in the final stage of Surface Tension where the Gargantua corners you at the top of a water tower. It&#39;s not a bug, just something that made me go &quot;huh&quot;.

When I first encountered the gargantua and ran down the tunnel and out into the open, my first reaction was to run out as far as I could and hide behind something, assuming there would be a tunnel or ladder or something. I didn&#39;t immediately assume to climb up on top of a tower and trap myself.
After the creature busts through the door and starts chasing me, I panicked and ran around looking for some place to go. Then, mysteriously, he broke off of chasing me and started shaking the tower and banging his head against it. He wouldn&#39;t notice me until I walked right up to him, then he finally turned around and attacked. But when I retreated about twenty yards, he turned back to shaking the tower. So I went &quot;huh? Why is he shaking this stupid tower for no reason?&quot;. Then I realized &quot;oh, it&#39;s because I&#39;m supposed to be at the top and he&#39;s trying to get at me.&quot; This line of reasoning broke the realism and took me out of the game for a moment.

This scene is too scripted. The gargantua should chase me around UNTIL I try to run up the tower to get out of his way, like a cat climbing a tree to get away from a dog. Otherwise it doesn&#39;t make much sense for him to randomly shake the tower and ignore me, because the game expects me to have immediately known to climb it. It also defeats the purpose of the stage because once he starts shaking the tower it is very difficult for me to get to the ladder without suffering a lot of damage or dying-the last thing I want to do now is climb up the ladder.

See how this is kind of a break in logic? Or am I being petty?</description>

            <p>Yeah, this IS the moment in the game that took me out of the magic the most. On the one hand, I liked that the Garg is scripted to pay more attention to the only living target it can see, Gordon, but the tower-shaking thing MUST be a bug.</p>
<p>Also, it confuses me that when the Garg first arrives, it entirely ignores the soldiers and makes a beeline for Gordon. That didn’t help the immersion either. I know that every second of the chase counts, or else the player will feel little urgency in running, but at least have the soldiers killed when the garg bursts through the wall, so it has nothing else to chase.</p>

            <p>The first time I played that map, I did it exactly how it had to be done in the original Half-Life - lure the Gargantua down into the long water bit, then climb out and as he takes the long way round to get you, quickly jump up to the artillery map and order a strike. However, I quickly discovered that the Gargantua wasn’t following me down into the moat, instead just shaking the tower. If I were to suggest a way of remaking this particular fight, I’d say make it like the original - actually requiring a method to kill the Garg without getting killed yourself. Make it so that it follows you everywhere, and he can kill you from below if you stay at the screen too long. Was really surprised how easy this bit was compared to the original.</p>

<p>warpedfreeman, nice demonstration.  I think this would not work in this case though, since the Gargantua cannot get to the player on the tower.  I think it will just wander around aimlessly.  Try putting one HECU soldier outside of the Gargantua’s reach, but in such a position that the soldier can shoot at the Gargantua.  See what happens.</p>
<p>I actually found the Gargantua banging against the tower a nice clue as to where I needed to go.  You could also look at it from another standpoint:  if the Xen army is intelligent and organized, maybe the Gargantua is banging against the tower because it knows at the top is the only weapon capable of destroying it. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I disagree. The Xenians are an organized military force as well. The Gargantua likely saw you as a higher priority target than the Marines, considering you’ve already killed a Garg before. Something that can do that is quite threatening in itself, nevermind the other Xenians you’ve killed as well.</p>

<p>I disagree. The Xenians are an organized military force as well. The Gargantua likely saw you as a higher priority target than the Marines, considering you’ve already killed a Garg before. Something that can do that is quite threatening in itself, nevermind the other Xenians you’ve killed as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Related question: are you supposed to kill the gargantua by ordering an air strike a few feet away from the tower? Because I did, and it worked, but I spent the whole time thinking it was a really bad idea … and it probably shouldn’t have worked, given the destructive power here. (After all, if that strike can kill the gargantua, it should seriously damage the tower — at least the ladder! — and kill Gordon).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, in the original, the tower was much larger and the explosions much smaller, plus for me the Gargantua always bugged and stood at the door where he knocked it down. But I don’t see a problem with this in Black Mesa, if the team are interested in altering it a bit. Have the Garg stay still on one side, then have Gordon order an airstrike near the tower, killing the monster and knocking the tower over, ending the airstrikes. The way it’s been done in Black Mesa, you don’t need an airstrike to knock over the other tower to proceed, nor break open the bunker door, so it makes sense to have Gordon order an airstrike on himself and get thrown around by the explosion.</p>
<p>Might be a waste of the PIP airstrike interface, though, but it already is, considering there’s no need to use it anywhere but the Gargantua as it is.</p>

<p>You’re right. I just didn’t anticipate so many people chiming in with actual bugs, I thought it would be more of a suggestion column. Hopefully a friendly mod will move it.</p>

            <p>Yep, I did the same thing, ran right past that ladder. To compound the matter, when I tried to hastily go back up, I was insta-killed by something. Also, he ran right past those soliders who shoot open the vent, which was particularly equally immersion-breaking.</p>

            <p>I ran and jumped into the pool that was in the same map. I didn’t even notice the ladder until the Garg turned around and started shaking the tower.</p>
<p>If there are any other improvements to be made to this scene, I think instead of the Garg running through exploding cars, he should flip them over like in the original. Maybe a couple can explode also. He should also smash a car into the two soldiers in the beginning</p>

            <p>Yup, got this too. Specifically I ran towards the antenna thingy and watched him freak from there. Getting a little closer he ran over to me and I make a break for the tower and he kinda stood there. This could do with at least a small fix.</p>
