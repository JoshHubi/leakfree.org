            <p>donâ€™t have it but it should be a folder in your steamapps - your username folder named half life or something like that. go there and open the folder named hl2 or valve or hl and there it should be. remember that skins often come without proper folders so skin files needs to be placed in a materials - models folder or just models and sounds goes to sounds and so on</p>
