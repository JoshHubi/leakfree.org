    <title>Buffalo External HD - Firewire?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/buffalo-external-hd-firewire/6102</link>
    <description>Hello, folks!

So, I&#39;m once again soliciting assistance.  This time, it&#39;s in regards to an external hard drive of mine.  So, let&#39;s begin at the beginning.

It&#39;s a Buffalo 1TB external hard drive, model #HD-HS1.0TIU2/FUS.  On the back of the hard drive is a USB and two firewire ports (one 6-circuit and one 4-circuit).

On my computer (HP with Windows 7), I have a 6-circuit firewire port.  I also have a 4-circuit to 6-circuit firewire cable.

Currently, I have only a single USB cable which the hard drive is hooked up with now and it&#39;s working fine (756GB free, still.  Whoo!).  However, my printer is also USB so whenever I want to print something, I have to disconnect the hard drive to use the cable.

So, I figure, why not try my firewire cable, right?  Keep the printer on USB and use firewire for the hard drive.

However, when I hook it up (6-circuit into the computer and 4-circuit into the hard drive), nothing happens.  Windows doesn&#39;t recognize the drive.  The drive doesn&#39;t show up in &quot;Computer&quot;.  The hard drive doesn&#39;t power up.  Nothing.

I plug the USB cable back into the drive and the drive powers up and Windows detects the drive.

Any ideas?  I hope it doesn&#39;t get to a point where the only option is &quot;Get another USB cable&quot; because getting down to the store is a hassle and I won&#39;t have any money until the 1st (or 2nd).</description>

            <p>Whoops.  More info was needed (I thought providing the model number was enough):  There’s a power cord as well.  The drive can be set to “auto power” or “manual power”.  Auto-power is where the power comes from the computer (I imagine) while “manual power” is where the power comes from the outlet (considering when I flip it to “manual”, the power light on the drive comes on).</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether the drive is set to “auto” or “manual” power, it’s not recognized by Windows.</p>

            <p>4 pin firewire doesn’t give power IIRC, so you need an alternative power source for the drive.</p>
