    <title>Other old games you would like to see redone...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/other-old-games-you-would-like-to-see-redone/3902</link>
    <description>So, while I was going through some old stuff I found a CD of LucasArts &quot;Outlaws&quot;.

![](upload://qU4dsfnagYEquZ8BabW6nNVpWAd.jpeg)

This is definitely one of the games I would like to see redone similarily to Project BM.

The HUD was cool, the Clint Eastwood like fights were phenomenal and the story was epic. I wonder why there are almost no good Wild West FPS games. Most FPS revolve around sci-fi settings, which is neat. But the Wild West genre is like the grandfather of FPS games. It is probably just my love for Colts...
In fact I would volunteer for a team making such a project.

So, as I think/feel that this project is slowly coming to an end: any games you would like to se redone?</description>

<p>Neither would I. It’s sad they wont allow remakes of some of their greatest games. Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana as examples.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m pretty sure SquareEnix won’t allow anyone to make anything closely related to their games.</p>
<p>They have been “linked” (99% of the time it’s bullshit) to a sequel to Chrono Cross or at least a remake of Chrono Trigger, but haven’t put out any piece of info in ten years.</p>
<p>An independent group of developers started remaking Chrono Trigger with full 3D graphics and stuff a while back, and Square shut them down with a cease-and-desist letter as soon as they were informed of the project.</p>
<p>Unless they’ve changed their policy since then (in which case someone should tell the guys from Chrono Resurrection to release their shit :3), which I highly doubt, I wouldn’t keep my hopes up.</p>

<p>Haha, I just had to register when I saw this. One of the first things I thought about when I saw the name of this thread was actually Outlaws.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  That truly was a great game. Used to be my favorite when I was younger. Actually been dreaming about a remake for that game for a long time.</p>
<p>Another game I’d really, really like to see a remake of is Populous: The Beginning.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populous_3</a></p>
<p>Truly an awesome and well made game to be from 1998.</p>
<p>I recently downloaded and played this again for the first time in probably 10 years and I still am blown away by how well they made everything. Fantastic game.</p>
<p>Being able to shape the land as you wish, blow up a whole city by casting a volcano spell in the middle of it, blow away houses with tornadoes. The animations was so great as well. I loved to watch my people walk into their houses, build them larger when they felt the need for it, go about and chop trees as they prepared to build stuff. And watching them fight eachother was awesome. Kicking and pushing eachother - somethings pushing eachother off cliffs and into the water, since there was a lot of physics involved.</p>
<p>There is some half-assed attempt at remaking it out there, but it looks crappy and seems like it’s done by unprofessionals.</p>

<p>Um, doesn’t Valve get to decide what it’s supposed to look like, since you know, they <span class="bbcode-i">made</span> the game? If you don’t like the way they made it, tough for you because Valve is never going to remake it. There’s no reason for them to, and every reason not to. Best you’re going to get is that mod that tries to recreate the beta.</p>

<p>I meant a sequel to Chrono Cross* Hehe sorry!<br>
I would want a remake of Secret of Mana, I think that sole game is the better than any Final Fantasy game, even though it’s a spinoff from those games!</p>

<p>It’s called Chrono Cross and it was released for PS a decade ago. Also an amazing game, as good as Chrono Trigger I’d say. It got a rare 10/10 from Gamespot and was also praised by a million other gaming sites.</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a proper sequel though, more like a side story. There are a few characters from Trigger and a few of the storylines interact with the ones from the first game, but aside from that it’s pretty much a different game (which doesn’t make it bad though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ).</p>
<p>Still, I wish they hadn’t shut down Chrono Resurrection… it was such an amazing project. And I mean, if you’re not gonna care about your best franchise (yes, Final Fantasy sucks) for over 10 years at least let other people who care do it.</p>

<p>AoE2, but keep it 2D. Just up the resolution considerably and add zoom. I wouldn’t really condone new ages, but some new civs and techs would be kinda nice… Although I didn’t really like the conquerors expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Strategy is one of those genres I always thought was better in 2D. Games like Starcraft and AOE2 actually LOOKED pretty good, even when compared with modern games. If they did some company-internal super-high-res models, and just rendered them for the top-down perspective, it would look awesome.</p>
