          <p>Had a few hiccups on the way there (it turns out that overlays will stretch to fill the whole screen, causing the image to distort and change its aspect ratio; a fact which is made worse by the fact that the textures have to be powers of two so I can’t just make one padded to the right aspect ratio from the start), but I think I’ve finally cracked the problem of displaying transparent overlays on the HUD:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/918050776487194413/E3AE3719B21713BC9E39C26AFEDA7859EFD23817/" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/918050776487194413/E3AE3719B21713BC9E39C26AFEDA7859EFD23817/" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1920×1080</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This was accomplished in a rather roundabout way using an entity called <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Script_intro" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">script_intro</a> which overlays the display from a point_camera onto the player’s view. It doesn’t have direct support for alpha textures but has a number of weird render modes, the most useful of which (<span class="hashtag">#5</span>) cuts out any of the camera pixels which are exactly RGB=0 0 0 black. I put the document texture on a black background and pointed the camera at it, then let the script_intro do the rest. The text and Black Mesa emblem don’t disappear because they aren’t perfectly black but rather RGB = 1 1 1, which looks pretty much identical. Also worth noting is that while I originally had the texture as an UnlitGeneric the pure white paper actually generated a lot of HDR bloom that completely eliminated the text; instead the paper is actually a lightmapped texture, but there are no lights in the box where it is located, and instead it has SelfIllum turned on with a tint value of 0.4 0.4 0.4.</p>
<p>The future is therefore looking up for any number of HUD-based additions to Black Mesa, including destination-selectable trams and elevators.</p>

<p>Huh, I just assumed that the amount of tranquilizer required to subdue an adult bullsquid was enough to be leathel to humans.</p>
<p>Interesting idea about the health chemicals being derived from vortigaunts. It’s would certainly explain a lot.</p>
<p>…makes me wonder who the fist person was to voluntarily inject themselves with drugs synthesized from an alien larval hormone.</p>

          <p>So as I develop more and more of these documents, I am becoming less and less able to avoid the fact that <span class="bbcode-i">I have no idea how Black Mesa’s sectors and areas are organized, or what actually separates a sector <span class="bbcode-b">from</span> an area.</span></p>
<p>Filling in <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/29171-An-Inaccurate-Map/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the somewhat interpretive map</a> I’ve been using for the pre-disaster project with known sectors from Black Mesa in solid and <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/half-life/images/f/fd/Tram_map_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20120621212918&amp;path-prefix=en" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">‘dubious’ ones from the original Half-Life expansions</a> that the revised game may not hold to in dashes, we get… kind of a mess. The sectors of the facility aren’t really arranged in any sensible order and some of them are in different sizes, but at least there aren’t non-contiguous areas assigned to the <span class="bbcode-i">same</span> sector and I think this can actually be explained internally as Black Mesa having grown over time and the sectors having been assigned letters due to some sort of ordering that was not topological.</p>
<p>The big problem I am confronting is that there doesn’t really seem to be any rhyme or reason to why some locations have the ‘Area’ designation and some have the ‘Sector’ designation. For a while I thought that logistical/service sections were areas and research-related ones were sectors, but Sector D Administration and (the unseen in canon, so it isn’t yet on the map) Sector A Training kind of counter that. Conversely, I had also thought that there was more than one security office and ‘Area’ was a security-specific designation that referred to which portions of the base each was responsible for patrolling (so there would also be an Area 1 Security and Area 2 Security, etc., elsewhere in the complex, but no non-security Areas), but the presence of an ‘area 9 transit hub’ shoots that down as well. I could see Black Mesa using a different designation system for underground and topside sections (indeed, I think the letters identifying many buildings in Surface Tension are exactly such a system and do not correspond to sector designations at all) but the areas and sectors are both underground. There’s also the “Level 3 Dormitories”, but I think this refers to the security clearance of the personnel assigned there and not anything to do with its location.</p>
<p>I suppose it’s possible that the Areas are logistical hubs or critical points that either exist <span class="bbcode-i">within</span> Sectors or are specifically set up to be outside of them because they are Just That Important, while Sectors are more of a general agglomeration of different departments not important enough to merit their own Area. I don’t particularly like that as I think it’s inelegant, but it is probably what I’ll end up using unless I somehow come up with anything better.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Specialized Research-Related Branches: </span>I don’t think each individual lab or research project is represented in Sector D, but it’s possible the facility has a single ‘research management’ division that serves as a liason for all of them and handles the creation of new research areas/labs.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Security:</span> Actual security operations are likely handled through Area 3 or other security centers spread throughout the base, although I could potentially see some sort of central authority sitting overtop of that which handles things like the designation of area security clearances, overall emergency response procedure, and what is or is not classified.

<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Legal / Office Of General Counsel:</span> Highly likely to be in Sector D. I could actually potentially see it being split up into multiple different offices, including things like technology transfer, contracts, and licensing/regulatory compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Public Relations:</span> Obviously labs like the Lambda Complex and Biodome are highly secretive, but the ad copy on the displays in Anomalous Materials seems to indicate that a good amount of Black Mesa’s research is actually disclosed in some capacity to the public and/or other research institutions. So it is entirely possible that Black Mesa has administrative areas dedicated to public, academic, and inter-agency relations somewhere within it. There is some overlap here with the security, legal, and technology-transfer offices.</p>

<p>Funny you mention this, as I am a contractor for Mr. Govmt. I work in a contracting office that handles contracts for projects across the nation for our national parks. The list you have here is rather perfect and that it seems to include everything with the exception of contracting. I would say add that and you are gold!  If it helps, here is a <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/DFC_map_508_2014-0619.pdf" data-bbcode="true">map</a> of the main FED center in <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/regions/welcome-to-the-rocky-mountain-region-8/buildings-and-facilities/colorado/denver-federal-center" data-bbcode="true">Denver</a> that holds several business aspects of NPS. To be clear tho, it is not the <span class="bbcode-i">only </span>place you will find Feds. We are integrated all throughout the city in buildings here and there. Plane office buildings that you would never know are actually Fed facilities, unless you actually went inside and tried to access one of the offices. There, you would be greeted with a door that would not let you in unless you knew the code for the security lock.  So while I can certainly appreciate your attention to detail in getting it right, you are hindered by the fact that having a perfect representation of a government facility is NOT going to be a perfectly laid out map. In short, Fed centers are a hodgepodge of buildings laid out everywhere with no rhyme or reason to them. So in building your replica of a fed facility, feel free to make it disjointed and a bit “why the heck is the HR office so small and the cafeteria a quarter mile from the biggest hub of people?”</p>

          <p>With the above in mind, I am thinking that it’s mostly a matter of figuring out which sections I want to actually have <span class="bbcode-i">in</span> Office Complex and which I want to not deal with by saying that they are in other dedicated areas or are broken up between the different labs (in which case their head administrative officers might still be represented in the executive offices on Map C).</p>
<p>Now, looking at the elevator shafts Sector D actually has either eight, nine, or ten floors- the elevator shaft at the end of Map C has eight doors in it, but there’s also an open space at the bottom where the devs may not have bothered including a door because the player could never see it; the shaft seen during ‘permeable infrastructure’ has nine doors and a similar blank space midway up. Going with the somewhat ambitious estimate of ten that is more than enough for most of the stuff on the list save for IT and HR which I already said I think were spun off into their own areas of the complex… <span class="bbcode-i">but</span> those elevators also serve the High-Security Storage Facility and Canals. At least two of the levels in the terminal shaft serve the HSSF (Freeman enters the elevator on the very top floor and then rides it one level down) but we don’t know if that in turn serves the canals as well. However, I am fairly certain the large freight elevator that <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> serve the canals also goes to the HSSF, so of our ten floors <span class="bbcode-i">at most</span> seven are actually Office Complex and we know at <span class="bbcode-i">least </span>five of them are because we see at least <span class="bbcode-i">parts</span> of five office floors in the game- the ‘dev’ offices in Map A, Admin 1 in Map B, Admin 2 in most of Map C, a single office from Admin 3 also in Map C, and a skywalk from an unnamed office level above that. Admin C I am thinking is sort of a ‘hub’ area with the offices of various department heads like HR and IT who don’t have their entire departments in Office Complex itself, as well as stuff like the cafeteria and tram platform. So that in effect gives us between four and six slots to fill from our original list of 13 (the stuff above plus a dedicated contract office).</p>
<p>I’m going to cut out IT and HR as above because they are their own departments as well as a dedicated diversity branch because of the time period, bringing the list down to 10. The area-independent security functions as described above I think can be broken up between HR, Facilities, Legal, PR, and strategic planning, while I think research management and strategic management can be fused to bring the total to eight. I think the technology-transfer components of Legal can go into Public/Inter-agency Relations, while the regulatory components can go into SERC. Contracts is probably a part of Facilities/HR (and just in general Black Mesa seems a lot more self-contained than most federal projects so I don’t think they have quite as large of a department there) so we can scrap those two as well. I am then tempted to pop Facilities out into its own external area to give us a total of five.</p>
<p>Having only <span class="bbcode-i">four</span> departments actually appeals a great deal to me because it makes Office Complex symmetric about the hub area- it goes ‘Dev’ Offices -&gt; Admin 1 -&gt; <span class="bbcode-b">Admin 2 Hub</span> -&gt; Admin 3 -&gt; Skywalk area. So I may combine Procurement and Accounting into one level as well (the idea being that each area has a dedicated procurement office that then submit budgets and request forms to Sector D Accounting).</p>
<p>Of these departments Accounting &amp; Finance sounds like the least interesting, so I am going to put it in the skywalk area that we never see anything from. The title of “Dev Offices” in Map A is a strange one that none of the departments really seem to <span class="bbcode-i">fit</span>, but for some reason the more basement-y aesthetic of the place would I think be a good location for the safety offices.  Of the two remaining offices I am thinking that while Research Management <span class="bbcode-i">sounds</span> interesting there isn’t a great deal about it I would actually be able to run with, so I’ll put it in Admin 3 where we only see one office of it. That leaves Admin 1 (Map B) as the home of PR.</p>
