    <title>Get rid of automatic user registeration?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/get-rid-of-automatic-user-registeration/1369</link>
    <description>Seeing that these forums are plagued with hordes of bots almost 24/7, may I suggest that the staff turn off automatic registration for new arrivals? By forcing newcomers to directly send an email to a mod in order to obtain an user account, it should considerably cut down on the bot problem we have.</description>

            <p>This isn’t actually a half bad idea. Although I think it would work better to have an e-mail dedicated specifically to it, instead of having the mods e-mails clogged up with registration requests.</p>
