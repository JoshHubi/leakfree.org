    <title>Stupid bullsquids (AI issue)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stupid-bullsquids-ai-issue/10501</link>
    <description>Location: Blast Pit chapter, short corridor leading directly to the great hall flooded with toxic waste (where the elevator is).
I&#39;d like to report the bullsquid AI issues experienced in the following situations:

1) I see a bullsquid, I-shoot-it-spits, I hide round the corner, and the monster doesn&#39;t try to pursue or close-combat me (in HL1 it did, which was more natural. Predator, here I am, Y U NO ATTACK?))).

2) A little further, there&#39;re 2 more bullsquids in toxic waste, one&#39;s in the middle of the hall and another one is just under the precipice where I stand. While I fight the first one, the second one doesn&#39;t care about that and sits where it was. I think the creatures that see their kind being killed would try and find and attack the enemy too, especially if the threat direction is indicated by clearly visible distant attack like BS spit).

More than that, even when I position myself to see just a small part of its body and begin stuffing it with lead from the Glock, it stands still till death and doesn&#39;t even try and figure out what&#39;s hurting it! I expected it would run and look around searching for the attacker.

With respect to the BM Team&#39;s great work, HEVcrab)</description>

            <p>They are too calm, I noticed that too. They need to tweak their AI quite a bit.</p>

            <p>Bullsquids suck in BMS. They only ever camp and spit from wherever they were standing when they saw you/you provoked them.</p>
<p>Almost all of them are eating prior to you harassing them. Allowing for a quick grenade, and then walk-on-by. As they are blown to smithereens. Hitting them with the grenade doesn’t even get their attention.</p>
<p>Bullsquid AI is at an all time low. I’ve found them to be the dumbest of all enemies. They almost always won’t peruse you at all if you go out of their LOS (line-of-sight).</p>

            <p>Noticed this as well. I was disappointed because they look so creepy now, but they act like sentry guns, just with radioactive spit.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with you. That kind of behavior we see in BM is unnatural for a large carnivore.</p>

            <p>It would certainly look more intimidating, if those large creatures would spit and charge at you, as they did in the original Half-Life.</p>
<p>Too much spitting at the moment.</p>
