As seen here, a sleeping zombie manages to make constant idle sounds. I always had issue with this in the mod version but it&#39;s still there today. It&#39;s not only here as it&#39;s in any places where there are zombies like the &quot;We&#39;ve got hostiles!&quot; chapter where you can already hear the zombie that&#39;s hiding in the vent.

Suggestions to fix is to add delays between zombie idle sounds so that you don&#39;t hear constant zombie gurgling sounds and making it completely silent when the zombie is not agitated.</description>
