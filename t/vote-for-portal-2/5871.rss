    <title>Vote for Portal 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/vote-for-portal-2/5871</link>
    <description>I thought necroposting would work too, but a complete new topic could attract more people to take part.

Portal 2 has been nominated for the Most Anticipated Game of 2011 Award at Spike&#39;s upcoming Video Game Awards

Vote!111123456789

edit: I noticed that Bulletstorm and Duke Nukem Forever aren&#39;t there to vote, lol

And Black Mesa isn&#39;t there too, that means it comes out this year *speculate* :&gt;  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

<p>I honestly think Valve has made enough HL games; finishing the storyline would be nice, but it’s not what I’m excited about anymore. When the Orange Box came out, Episode 2 was kind of the least-highlighted game, and people forgot about it relatively quickly.</p>

<p>NO, they must continue the never-ending series… :freeman: &lt;-- Awesome!!!<br>
Btw: voted for portal 2, we should get back on topic.</p>

            <p>I base games on how fun I found them. I bought Lost Planet and it sucked, so I don’t expect Lost Planet 2 to be incredible.</p>
<p>I played Portal and it was really cool. That doesn’t mean I think Portal 2 will be incredible; I’ll have to play a gameplay demo before I decide that.</p>

<p>Not true at all. From the way he worded it Fancy Pants liked Portal 1, just not as much as Arkham Asylum. Portal 1 was a small expirement while Arkham Asylum was a full game.

It’s like saying Game A’s early prototype was fun but not as fun as completed Game B, so completed Game B’s sequel will be better than Prototype Game A’s sequel.</p>

<p>But this isn’t necessarily about which game is <span class="bbcode-i">better</span> based on it’s prequel’s characteristics; It’s about which game is more <span class="bbcode-i">anticipated</span>. I’m assuming Fancy Pants voted based on the enjoyment felt playing the games’ respective prequels.

</aside>
<p>I agree with the second part. I don’t mind that he found Batman more fun than Portal 1. I just disagree with the part where he says that means Portal 2’s sequel will be less fun than batman’s sequel. I’m saying you shouldn’t really judge a sequel by it’s prequel when the prequel was a small experiment and the sequel will be a full blown game. And which game is more anticipated should be based off which you think will be more fun.</p>
<p>Fancy Pants said Batman 2 would be better than Portal 2 because Batman 1 was better than Portal 1. This is illogical because Portal 1 was a small experiment while Portal 2 is a full blown game, so it stands to reason that Portal 2 will be more fun to play than Portal 1. Both the Batman’s are full blown games so there isn’t a whole lot to show that Batman 2 will be more fun than Batman 1.</p>

<p>garthbartin, that’s just illogical. By the same token, the game I’m making is INCREDIBLY short (about 5 seconds) and even more indie, but has an even HIGHER level of enjoyment. Plus I’m making a sequel to it. That should be most anticipated, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe I worded it badly. I think above is my best wording. I’m not at all trying to say shorter games are better. To a certain extent I’m saying the opposite.</p>

<p>Except there’s no logical connection to be had; It’s a vote for what game the voter is anticipating the most in 2011, and since I’m pretty sure there is no overall consensus on what makes something anticipated according to different people, any attempt to use logic to find a conclusion would be over before it began… ambiguous terms = indeterminable validity/soundness.</p>

            <p>Except there’s no logical connection to be had; It’s a vote for what game the voter is anticipating the most in 2011, and since I’m pretty sure there is no overall consensus on what makes something anticipated according to different people, any attempt to use logic to find a conclusion would be over before it began… ambiguous terms = indeterminable validity/soundness.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Not to say that you can’t disagree with the choice, but logic can’t really find an ‘absolute’ in this case, unless all parties agree to the same exact criteria for what should stimulate anticipation.</p>

<p>yooou suck, i liked arkham asylum better than portal.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s pretty awful logic seeing as Portal 1 was a short experiment thrown in with a bundle of games while batman Arkham Asylum was a full-blown long high budget game. And there has been almost no info on Batman Arkham Asylum so for all you know it’s practically a rebranding of the prequel. Portal 2 has had many demos that are evidence of it’s kickassness. That’s not to say I didn’t like Batman Arkham Asylum; it’s just unfair to judge Portal 2 on it’s completely different prequel.</p>
<p>Voted for Portal 2 because it’s the only one I won’t be pirating (excluding ofc GOW3 which is just ms’s bitch like Halo).</p>

<p>I can get excited about other games, although I don’t buy and play them.</p>

            <p>Arkham Asylum looked like a soup’d up version of Splinter Cell.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I was pretty tied between Infinite and Portal, but in the end I chose Portal. Wheatley is just too funny not to.</p>
