    <description>[b]EDIT 11/16/2010: [url=https://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=14928172]Click here for the redone (hopefully final) configuration[/url][/b]
----------------

As of November 16th, the build above is what I will be going for. I already have an el-cheapo mid atx case at home, as well as an sata dvd burner, and as I needed to cut corners to have enough money to upgrade my monitor I decided I&#39;ll buy a nice full tower case + second stick of 4gb ram + second 6850 + cpu cooler at a later date (I won&#39;t be overclocking too much until then). All the parts in the build right now should last me, including the power supply, which should easily handle two 6850s in crossfire + an overclocked phenom II quad core. The motherboard has heatsinks on the mosfets (needed for overclocking a 6 core in the future) + two x8 x8 crossfire slots (for the second 6850, better than x16 x4) + all the goodies like usb3 and sata III.

Note: I chose the 965 quad over the 955 ONLY because the latter is out of stock ATM. Otherwise I&#39;ll replace it with the cheaper 955 and just set the multiplier one higher to get the same results, it should work fine on stock cooling for now. By the time I get the hyper 212+ cpu cooler I&#39;ll either overclock the 955 a lot more, or upgrade to a 6 core.

If anyone can make ANY more suggestions, I&#39;m still taking them. I&#39;m not as confident on the monitor in the build above, [url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=24-236-052]so if this monitor has better image quality I&#39;ll get it[/url], despite the 1 inch smaller size. This is probably the main area I&#39;m still looking for advice in (the monitor would be replacing a 19&quot; Dell 1440x900 LCD).

Thanks again, guys.</description>

            <p>Haha, I don’t think I’ll be upgrading anytime soon with a 5870 and an i7.</p>
<p>At the very least I can sell it now for way more than I paid for it, because it really is worth more than $900.</p>

            <p>{I value image quality (for gaming and movies)}</p>
<p>Gaming and movies are two separate things.</p>
<p>Gaming = refresh rate, image crispness = typically a TN panel (at least for refresh rate).<br>
Movies = color gamut, sharpness, true dynamic contrast (ability to display true black) = typically an IPS panel</p>
<p>Compromise = eIPS panels, which are becoming more and more popular.  Notable in the Dell 2209WA, Dell 2211H/2311H, Dell U2410.</p>
<p>However, even eIPS panels are probably out of your price range.  True professional IPS panels can be ~$1,000US.  eIPS panels can be had for mid-$200’s to $400ish, depending on panel size.  Since you’re probably stuck with a TN, I’d suggest, by brand, an Asus or Samsung.</p>
<p>Note - just re-read your OP with the link to the Asus VH242H - I’d recommend that one.  Gets good reviews all over the 'Net (especially NewEgg) and the price is right.</p>

            <p>I would have no backup drive, but as I’m coming from a 500gb 5400rpm and felt no problems there I think I’ll be quite happy with the 7200rpm 1tb, and I doubt the 500 gig laptop drive I had contained anything more than an 8mb cache. And this 1tb was only used as a storage drive occasionally so it should work fine.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help! Any comments on what monitor to choose? That’s the area I’m especially looking for advice in right now.</p>

            <p>What will be your backup drive at that point?  And depending on your expectations/plans for this machine, you may feel the 16MB cache (slower).  And I rarely recycle drives if I can help it (especially OS drives - storage drives is one thing, but the OS drive usually gets the most abuse and is best to start fresh).</p>
<p>And I checked your most recent wishlist in the OP when I talked about the PSUs, so that’s what I was basing my comment from.  As always, if you’re happy with your research, then have at it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   Just passing along my $.02 as requested.</p>

            <p>Well I actually changed the PSU since then, guess I forgot to say that in this thread, my bad. And I don’t trust mail in rebates at all, they never work for me, and the extra 100watts for $10 less that the Rosewill gives is worth it to me, especially since its well-reviewed all around.</p>
<p>Single platter = faster, most of the time, but thats irrelevant since I just realized that the “Green” hard drive I have in my external is actually a 7200rpm Hitatchi with a 16mb cache, which is more than enough for me, so you can factor the hard drive out of the equation (i’ll be taking the hard drive out of the external chassis and using it as my main HD).</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>While I’m sure the Corsair, Thermaltake, etc. PSUs are top-quality, I don’t have the money to pay for the brand name. I’m not planning on buying an AZZA PSU or anything, but Rosewill seems to be getting great reviews and has minimal voltage fluctuations, and for the amount of money I’m saving on it I think its my best option.</p>

<p>The PSU you selected is $99.  The one I suggested is $109, and $99 after mail-in-rebate.  You can’t afford to spend the same amount of money?</p>
<p>As for the hard drive, I agree with Mango, but if $15 is too much, then so be it.</p>
<p>Why do you care if it’s single platter or not?  Caviar Black = one of my favorite hard drives (well, probably the only I’d use, beyond SSDs)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>For that price, though, I can get a 1gb Western Digital Blue (which, except for the extended warranty and doubled cache, is pretty much the same), and seeing as how I’m already over my budget, that additional $15 isn’t quite worth it for me.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found a Caviar Black 500gb with a 32mb cache for only 5 dollars more, so I switched to that. 500gb is fine for me since I have a 1tb external for movies and stuff.<br>
EDIT2: Apprantly the Caviar Black may not be single platter, so I switched to a caviar blue which should be just as good, minus the doubled cache (and also a few bucks cheaper)</p>

            <p>BUMP for almost completely redone configuration (read the first post in this thread for updated info).</p>
<p>Pretty much the only place I need advice in now is the monitor. My first choice is in the new build, my other choice is at the bottom of the first post. I value image quality (for gaming and movies) over the 1 inch size difference, so if one is better than the other please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot guys, I think I’m almost done choosing parts.</p>

            <p>NEVER go cheap on a power supply.  Never, ever, ever.  It’s the foundation of the entire computer, and one of the 4 that you can’t run a system without (PSU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard - everything else is extraneous).  That said, if you’re getting a large case with ample storage space and good cable routing (which the Azza doesn’t seem to have, to be honest), you can go non-modular (but I still wouldn’t get a Rosewill).  For PSUs I’d recommend Ultra, Corsair, Thermaltake, and PC Power &amp; Cooling.  As of late, I’d recommend the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139006&amp;Tpk=corsair%20750" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Corsair 750TX</a></p>

            <p>I’ll look into some reviews of that case, but TBH I like the AZZA’s design a little better, plus the AZZA is newer, doesn’t have a high-glossy look that attracts fingerprints, and has a USB 3.0 port in the front.<br>
If price becomes too much of an issue though that is a solid case to fall back to.</p>
<p>Also, sorry to ask, but one more thing: The PSUs I will be getting will most likely be Rosewill, due to the low price and attractive blue LEDs, plus long cables.<br>
The choice for me is either 750watt Modular, or 850watt non-modular. Both are about the same price. I’d think the 850watt would be better since I have more room in this case to store the cables + it would allow more room for upgradability, but I’d still like a confirmation.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the help, again. For now, I put the 850watt into the wishlist.</p>

<p>Thanks, but since the case I chose is a little more expensive then I would have hoped (but I really would rather not skimp on it as it should be the longest-lasting part of my build by far), would you suggest saving money by not going modular? I’m hoping that the fact that the case is bigger would allow me to buy a non-modular PSU and save ~$20, but I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>EDIT: Changed motherboard to 870 chipset from 880g chipset because its $17 cheaper, and I don’t need the onboard video or 3rd PCI-e lane.<br>
EDIT2: Changed to MSI 6850 because its cheaper and MSI should be better than powercolor. This gives me enough money to find a PSU of similar pricing as the rosewill 750watt, which is out of stock</p>

<p>Go Modular, it’ll make you enjoy your life a little more.</p>
<p>As for your case, well, could you give me a minute?</p>
<p>EDIT - This is new, and seem’s pretty swish, available in black, white, and even red if you look elsewhere.</p>

<p>It’s also cheaper.</p>

            <p>looks like a solid build mate, if your happy with, i’d go ahead with it.</p>
<p>PSU looks a bit cheap, don’t goof on this area, id go more midrange, i got a Corsair HX-750, its quality at its best if you look into it.</p>

            <p>Yep, first you make a private wishlist for your own account, then make it public.</p>
<p>I have a wishlist from early 2009 that I never saw through, and its still there, although most of the items are deactivated.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also just changed case to AZZA Hurrican. Price falls within my budget with a little stretching and is receiving amazing reviews, despite the brand not being too well known. It was either that or the Antec 1200, DF-85, HAF 932 or Azza Solano 1000. This one should be better than all of them, in theory.<br>
EDIT2: Currently looking for a different, cheaper powersupply… will update this post when I found one</p>

            <p>Hey, don’t get too upset if you can’t get GTA4 on full graphics. I’ve that people with pretty awesome computers have a hard time pleasing that game. &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>EDIT: I also can’t seem to access your new wishlist. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>EDIT2: Never mind, I found the post where you listed it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Use google.</p>

<p>Mines about 8 months old. I bought the mobo I did specifically because you could unlock using it, but I’ve not tried insofar</p>

            <p>Bump, updated configuration to reflect lower budget and more research on parts. Slightly updated description of what I’m after in OP. New link (also in OP): <a href="https://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=16056006" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=16056006</a></p>
<p>Thanks again for the advice, although I’m clearly still not entirely confident with my setup and could use more tips.</p>
