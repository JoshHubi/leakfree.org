    <title>Building a PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/building-a-pc/3717</link>
    <description>It occurred to me that while I know enough to build a PC and I know what works with what I have no clue what I&#39;m looking for in terms of what I need to run. My goal is to run Crysis on 1080p in max settings with decent fps for around $1200, its a bit ambitious. I just need some ideas on cheap but effective parts. Also if anyone knows of cases that aren&#39;t just hideous I&#39;d like to know I&#39;ve yet to see a nice looking well ventilated PC Case.</description>

            <p>Drop to 4 gigs ram, and you could consider an i5 for a little more money. It doesn’t matter that much, they’re both great cpus that overclock really well.</p>
<p>But I don’t think you’re going to be playing crysis at max, 1080p, 60 fps without a couple of 5870s.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Running Crysis at 1080p is going to be a heavy task, right now I have a quadcore running at 2,6 GHz - 6 gigabyte of DDR-3 high speed RAM and a NVIDIA GTX 285. With this setup playing Crysis at the highest settings @ 1920x1200 is not very pleasent, if you want to play with ~30 FPS you need to use high settings, if you want very stable FPS (50+) you’d have to switch to medium.</p>
<p>I’m not sure about NVIDIA at the moment, it seems ATI has some great cards with decent prices. As for the RAM you should definitely go for 4 gig minimum, I find myself using 2 gig already when my system is idle.<br>
Make sure your CPU is running at a decent speed (my quad @ 2,6 GHz is quite slow). If you get high speed RAM make sure you have cooling for them (a simple fan on the side of the case will do).</p>
<p>One final thing; I suggest you don’t go for dual-GPU, they generate a lot of heat, they eat a lot of power and they often microstutter. My dual-GPU the 9800GX2 died within half a year due to high temperates (not to mention it was a horrible card overall). I then got the GTX 285 which is a superb card (single-GPU).</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>Instead of using a 1000 Gb harddisk why not use two 500 Gb disks and put them in RAID 0 for greater speeds?</p>

            <p>yeah after looking up there benchmarks the ATI is a much stronger card so I’m gonna go with two of them instead. and DX11 should become more commonplace as the years roll on.</p>

            <p>Yes but if you notice most developers have been using nVidia lately so it seems a better investment. I’ll look into ATI a bit before purchasing. and I’ll be running windows 7 maybe I should get a legit version since all I have is a :pirate: version</p>

            <p>Well I said that because 5xxx are cheaper, I believe. They’re smaller, don’t consume as much power, have DX11, and outperform the GeForce 200 series.</p>

            <p>Looks fairly solid to me, however you may or may not be better off just getting a single ATi 5xxx series card. Considering your CPU is an AMD as well as your mobo.</p>
<p>Don’t forget an OS, unless you already have one.</p>

            <p>I’ve been using that case with a Q9300 and a 4870 for a long while now. Very quiet, easy to use and effective. I much prefer i to the Antec 900.</p>
<p>As for parts, I could go into detail, but instead I will just link to this great guide:<br>
<a href="https://techreport.com/articles.x/18510/6" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a><br>
Minus the expensive case and the blue ray drive and you are there. If you aren’t an audiophile you can also eliminate the xonar DX sound card. There is a couple alternatives on the next page of the article too.<br>
Comes with Assassins creed 2 as well…</p>

<p>I posted that in some other thread. It’s fairly cheap, and is a nice case. Well ventilated, and quiet. Or so the reviews say, anyway.</p>
