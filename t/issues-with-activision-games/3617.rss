    <title>Issues with Activision Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/issues-with-activision-games/3617</link>
    <description>Hey guys, 
I recently built a new computer so I&#39;m gradually installing all my old games on it. I&#39;m having issues, however, with two of my games (both from Activision), Marvel Ultimate Alliance and Ultimate Spider-Man. With both the games, wehn I try to launch them they close and the standard Windows error message (XXXX has stopped working). I&#39;ve tried getting help from Activision but they won&#39;t help as I&#39;m running Windows 7 64-bit. Does anyone have any idea how I can fix this problem?

Thanks in a advance for your help!  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>I’m guessing you’ve already done this but have you set them to run as administrator and set the compatibility mode to either Vista and XP?</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve done some reading and it turns out that the “MUA protection system” <span class="bbcode-i">AKA DRM system</span> that Actionvison employs on those games are not compitable on windows 7 and there is no work around that I can find.</p>
<p>Your two option that I see is to either get the virtual XP that comes with windows 7 ultimate installed or go download an unauthorized copy that has its copy protection removed. It be important that it be removed and not just patched because you will just run into the same problem.</p>

<p>Would a no-cd work (replacement .exe)?</p>
