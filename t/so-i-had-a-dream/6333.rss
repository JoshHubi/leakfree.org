    <title>So I had a Dream...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-i-had-a-dream/6333</link>
    <description>[i]Yea well, I had a Dream last night. I never dream anymore, First dream in years, anyways, I dreamt that Black Mesa was Released , yes a bit corny, but anyways, once it was released the whole damn world went insane just for this mod, and the mod it self as i forsore it, was bloody awesome, but for some reason, the tram intro scene was fast paced and had fast paced music and awesome machinery and what not, but it looked freakin awesome, oh and the graphics looked like cry engine 3 but somewhat source still.

Anyways My point is, I always thought the people who talked about Dreaming about Black mesa here where Strange, but now i have had a dream somewhat about it and I no longer think they are strange.[/i][/SIZE]

I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, “Nah, forget it. Yo, holmes to Bel-Air!” I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, “Yo holmes smell ya later!” Looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air."</span>[/SIZE]</p>
