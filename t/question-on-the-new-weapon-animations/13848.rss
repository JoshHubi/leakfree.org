    <title>Question On The New Weapon Animations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-on-the-new-weapon-animations/13848</link>
    <description>So ya, I like the new animations for the weapons they do look, and sound stronger ( apart from the crowbar, I felt like THOR with that thing). but I remember back in 2012 when the mod first came one of the big complaints was that &quot;feel&quot; of the weapons was lacking. Then later on creator by the name of  &quot; IIopn&quot; I believe created the &quot;IIopn&#39;s Revamp animation pack&quot; for every weapon in game . After that everyone was using is mod. So my question is did that guys mod have an influence on new animations in the retail BM because the look and fell of the guns are very similar. Had to ask.</description>
