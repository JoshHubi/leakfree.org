    <title>I made a short guitar solo to the on a rail theme!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-made-a-short-guitar-solo-to-the-on-a-rail-theme/14792</link>
    <description>I was playing the game, and when I hit the chapter On A Rail and heard the music start up, it instantly inspired me to make something with that track. I extracted it from the game files and made a few mockup guitar solos until i rehearsed the take i liked the most and recorded it. I originally decided to go for something faster, but the cadence and rhythm of the track made me want to go for something more atmospheric and slow to complement its explorative and mysterious vibe. It is short, but i think it gets that message across nicely  :smiley:  

I hope you all like it:

            <p>That’s fantastic!<br>
Only thing is, is that i see these remix fit in a mod of sort.<br>
Like a hard-core, metal songs in the background mod.</p>

            <p>Most people on the internet who play guitar always over do solos to show off their skills.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is you show restraint well. Loved it.</p>
