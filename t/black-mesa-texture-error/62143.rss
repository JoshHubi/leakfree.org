            <p>You did not post your system specs, always do that. Most likely it does not have a discrete gpu and runs off an igpu which means that it does not meet the minimum specs.</p>
<p>But luckily there is a fix for low-end systems.</p>
<p>To fix black props (and it’s also the fix for the flashlight not working ) do the following.<br>
add these commands to the games launch options ;<br>
-force_vendor_id 0x10DE -force_device_id 0x1180 -dxlevel 95</p>
<p>Here’s how to add commands to the launch options<br>
Right-click on the game title under the Library in Steam and select Properties.<br>
Under the General tab click the Set launch options… button.<br>
Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK.<br>
Close the game’s Properties window and launch the game.<br>
