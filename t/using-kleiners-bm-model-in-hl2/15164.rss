    <title>Using Kleiner&#39;s BM model in HL2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/using-kleiners-bm-model-in-hl2/15164</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve renamed all the models properly, brought in all the necessary textures, including Kleiner&#39;s BMS specific textures, and the scientist body textures, and Kleiner has the correct model, jiggleboned tie and all, but is completely pink and black checkers save for his eyes and hands. Is there any simple way I could fix this? I just like BMS&#39; open coat model for Kleiner better, and would like to use it in playing HL2.</description>
