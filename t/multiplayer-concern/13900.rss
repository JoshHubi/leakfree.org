    <title>Multiplayer Concern</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/multiplayer-concern/13900</link>
    <description>New to the forums but not the game, I just bought a bunch of friends and I KF2 and we are bored and saw this and I was stoked. But the issue I have with these Indi companies is their lack of kicking hacking in the bud.
1. I was wondering what precautions are taken to take care of hackers in this game
1. Are there plans for rentable servers and if so when
1. What is some feedback from people in the multiplayer thus far.
Thank you for your time.</description>
