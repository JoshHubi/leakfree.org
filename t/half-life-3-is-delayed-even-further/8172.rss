<p>Wasnt talking about portal, i loved the game, or any of valve games in particular. Just about the moronic approach of not criticizing a game.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think you missed the point where you weren’t actually criticizing at all, you were aimlessly bitching.</p>
<p>But yeah. CS:GO didn’t only delay Half life (2 episode) 3, but it delayed Alien swarm 2: the revengening, Ricochet plus, Half life 2 director’s cut, AND Dota 2.</p>

            <p>Again, this is not greed from Valve’s part. I think its pretty reasonable, actually. After all, every developer wants their games to be played. This becomes easier when it can run on a regular PC rather than a “I need liquid Nitrogen to cool my processor” PC.</p>
<p>And if graphics are really THAT important to you, simply wait until two more iD Tech and you’ll get your kind of heaven, you strange person.</p>

<p>Consoles aren’t holding Valve’s games back any more than the fact that over 96% of Steam users are using DX9 or lower. Obviously they aren’t going to push the graphics envelope if the majority of their customers wouldn’t be able to play the game.</p>

<p>/\This/\</p>
<p>The reason that valve does a “hardware survey” with every install is to collect this kind of data. There is a reason that valve is one of the most successful companies on the planet, they know their customers. As one of the people who still has a dx9 graphics processor, I appreciate that I can still run valve games. I can barely run crysis on a level that looks like utter crap. ep3 runs on full everything</p>

<p>While I’ll agree Episode 1 was a weak entry its setting was nice (even though it didn’t feel that varied.) But Episode 2 was a great game I felt, with nice open levels in the forests and final stage and nice tight spaces in the Antlion nest and the white forest base.</p>

<p>The only problems with the 360 version of The Orange Box were:</p>
<p>Lack of M&amp;K<br>
TF2 never got it’s bugs fixed</p>
<p>I’ve heard horror stories about the PS3 version, but the 360 version runs smooth as hell and looks great.  Probably has a few options turned down, but it still looks nice.</p>

<p>I agree, consoles arent holding them back. Batman arkham city and gta 4 are great examples of huge console games. Whats holding them back is source+consoles combo, that engine was never written for multiplatform, and it shows.</p>

<p>Portal 2’s Metacritic rating is 95.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wasnt talking about portal, i loved the game, or any of valve games in particular. Just about the moronic approach of not criticizing a game.<br>
But episode 1 and 2 sure sucked balls.</p>
<p>And whats stopping valve from making a scaleable game for high end pcs and the weaker ones. Game lods, hd textures, postprocesing, detailed textures can make all the difrence. But for that they would have to add proper streaming into source, so it stops leading the whole level at the start of it.<br>
Just look at gta4, and red dead from rockstar for an example, they do wonders on the old console hardware.</p>
<p>And hi Maxey.<br>
Still a cunt i see, stay classy.</p>

<p>Valve has a history of making their games accessible to a very large amount of people. It’s not greed, I’m sure, it’s that Valve would rather sacrifice graphics and allow pretty much everyone to run their game than push the envelope and have nobody be able to play their game.</p>

<p>this.</p>
<p>I’ve said this before, but my six-year-old laptop can still run L4D2 on mid-settings like a champion.  Try that with any other modern game, my laptop would melt and fuse to my desk.  It’s not about $$$ for Valve, it’s about $$$ for their fans: Valve knows that not everybody can afford to build a high-end gaming PC, and so they sacrifice the cutting-edge graphics in favor of better aesthetics, which is much more effective anyway.  Valve are masters of immersion and storytelling.</p>
<p>But if you can’t get past the less-than-photorealistic graphics, well, then boo-hoo rich kid, go play your BF3 generic war shooter garbage.</p>

<p>As much as I would like to see a Cryengine-like version of Source (which I’m sure would be much more optimized) from Valve I’m sure a lot of people would be pissed since Valve has a history of making their games accessible to a very large amount of people. It’s not greed, I’m sure, it’s that Valve would rather sacrifice graphics and allow pretty much everyone to run their game than push the envelope and have nobody be able to play their game.</p>
<p>With that said, after people saying that Source is falling behind in the physics department with Source to other games, I would prefer that they improve on the physics rather than the graphics.</p>
<p>Edit: And I just looked it up. Gibbelin was on to something. About 70% of people that filled in the hardware survey on Steam are using either DX9 or DX10 so since Valve has access to this information, they’re not going to want to make a DX11 game that 70% of their users can’t play.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>just a heads up: source was cutting edge when it first came out, and it was really hard to run it on max unless you had a high end pc.</p>
