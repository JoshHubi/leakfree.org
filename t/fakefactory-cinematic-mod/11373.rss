Had anyone ever heard about this Mod? Is it good?

Because of Black Mesa I wanted to replay HL2 and remembered some dudes where doing a mod in order to pimp up the graphics.

I am downloading right now.</description>

            <p>CM12 with the bloom and sunrays set to moderate, vignetting, enb, and film noir colors make the game look stunning. I also love how smooth the engine runs with the new version, even with some lag on my midrange card it runs without any distracting jerkiness. The only things I’ve never liked about CM tho is the fact he makes slutty alyx variants in the first place(whether you can use the original model or not is a moot point) and the cinematic soundtrack. I think it would be much better if fakefactory composed his OWN cinematic style music rather than copy pasting some movie osts and calling it a day. It would make the project more genuine.</p>

            <p>The character models depends more on taste I think, they look pretty <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103234538" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">good</a> as do the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103234436" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">rest</a>.</p>
<p>I am replacing all screenshots of HL2 with those of Cinema Mod as I play. I really like CM12.</p>

<p>CM12 still is LE (light edition without the HD characters) but in the full version you can pick which ones you like, vanilla or hd.</p>

            <p>CM 12 looks awesome, his skills with environments precede the character models. Most of them look even worse than the originals (modelling-wise, G-man for example looks like someone from X-files and the other variant like a grandpa) so… it’s best to use the original models for the main characters, Breen model is very decent, same for Mossman (even though she looks too young, so that might need a fixing) as for the citizens, HD are okay in most cases.<br>
Combine look good by default, not really digging them in Star Wars uniforms or what’s that.</p>

            <p>The idea has potential, it just has poor execution. Giving HL2 a darker tone would be sick, but instead, he models characters after super-models instead of giving them a more realistic (yet still, sexy) look.</p>
<p>I really like the music, because I love soundtrack music. He mostly uses Batman Music (I’m pretty sure this whole project was inspired by TDK)</p>
<p>Also, if there were first person cinematic, such as interactive sequences like CoD, it would make the mod worth playing (instead of just playing a copy of HL2 that was painted over)</p>
<p>All in all, he needs to cut back on what he’s doing, and instead of sticking HL2 on overdrive, he should make it a slightly more CINEMATIC experience rather than one that makes you horny after playing for 20+ minutes. (Guilty as charged)</p>

            <p>I played it for a bit a while back, can’t remember which version though.</p>
<p>The parts that I really liked were the improved shadows and reflections and such, but all the other shit I could have gladly gone without.<br>
I played without the new models, but even some of the changed textures just seemed weird and out of place, sometimes they were just too realistic (in a sense that they were probably just photographs and barely processed) and oddly pasted over models that didn’t have the right polygons.</p>
<p>As I said in another thread a few months back, the guy has talent when it comes to asset-making and building terrain, but he simply has poor taste and doesn’t seem to know what actually fits.</p>
<p>Fakefactory would work a lot better as a member of a team, where he would be restricted and could only do what he actually knows anything about. As it is now it’s like letting your set designer direct and episode of your show, or a construction worker be the architect of a building.</p>
<p>In any case, I think I’m actually going to give some “lite” version another shot, though. When last I tried it I could barely run it, but my computer has been upgraded, and I figure, what the hell, I don’t have anything better to do.</p>

            <p>I tried the 12 on xp 32 bit</p>
<p>It only runs on 64 bit systems but on 32 bit it crashes when loading the next level</p>
<p>It looked so good in xp 32 bit that I just bought Win7 64-bit in order to be able to play the complete mod</p>
<p>Keep you informed!</p>

            <p>10 or 12 that is nearly same , the mod is nice , citizens are a bit nice because i think , i ll never seen twice the same face ,<br>
for alyx-adriana<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
it s boring and i think she gets too much naked , despite this is the norm :<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>the missing thing in his mod , is more actions and some special effects like the garg’s hands fire that is very nice and cool to see while playing<br>

            <p>See the bloom in Fakefactory’s mod did it in for me too. The old models lost all detail and the citizens were just white glowing blobs with eyes. The new models well… I tried that and just quit at water hazard. I don’t think I played 11 though, might have a look at it.</p>
<p>I see there is a 12, would anyone recommend that?</p>

            <p>CM (tried v10 lite) gives the game a completely different feel and call me nostalgic but I prefer the vanilla atmosphere. Filip Victor’s mod is ok, if a bit bloom-happy.</p>

            <p>I downloaded it and tried the first map. I didn’t like it. It looked of amateur hour. Like he changed the texture of the coke can to  coca-cola which is a trademark and breaks the atmosphere. Also he used huge texture re-skins on models which are completely unnecessary and just make the system memory requirement ridiculous. Randomly using huge 2048 x 2048 textures on everything doesn’t make it HD, better graphics  would be achieved by a more clever and liberal use of it. I think just rebaking the model texture with better AO would make a world of difference. The mod messes  up alot of lighting details like you walk into that part in the first map with barney and changed the lighting to red. Also there was random things thrown around the maps like boxes which when hit caused a frame rate drop from the havoc physics. If the author of this made those models, hes got skill for character modeling, but has much to learn about good level design.</p>

            <p>I hated CM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 but CM 11 is quite good because it adds EP2 foliage and trees to regular HL2, which may lag on some computers but on mine it doesn’t and looks great.</p>
<p>I have all character models restored to the originals though.</p>

<p>It is about playing the game using Fake Cinema and have it look like <a href="https://www.google.be/search?q=beautiful+woman&amp;hl=nl&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qu1yUNP4BYqs0QX21YGoAw&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=898" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> or play the original game and have it look like <a href="https://www.google.be/search?q=beautiful+woman&amp;hl=nl&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qu1yUNP4BYqs0QX21YGoAw&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=898#hl=nl&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=ugly+woman&amp;oq=ugly+woman&amp;gs_l=img.3...192968.194548.0.194787.10.9.0.1.1.1.351.677.8j3-1.9.0...0.0...1c.1.AJcxYYm4m6Y&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=1852a02b230e1265&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=898" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a></p>

            <p>I have been playing the latest version (11) but it has no HD characters yet and version 4. From version 5 on a 64bit OS is required.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between early versions and latest versions.</p>
<p>Version 4 is terrible, especially the HD characters and I agree it should be avoided.</p>
<p>Version 11 is a different story. Unfortunately it requires a 64 bit os and I could only play the first level but I think it is fantastic how it looks and the work which has been done.<br>
A lot of additional details have been added and it looks very good.</p>
<p>I do not know which version you people have been playing but how version 11 looks right now I think it is a keeper.</p>
<p>I had a look at Filip Victor’s HL2 Update (version 3 is due this year), it looks good and probably I will install it too (thanks for the link) but FakeFactory Cinematic Mod 11 looks way much better.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, I guess it’s good for what it’s trying to be (except for slutty females, fuck that), and it looks kinda nice, I suppose, so in it’s own right it’s not bad.</p>
<p>But as stated before if you’re expecting it to stay the course with Half-Life and not Hollywood don’t play it, you’ll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Let me warn you, if you like HL2’s aesthetics, and if you like level detail that makes sense, Cinematic mod is not for you.</p>

<p>^ What he said. I recommend <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Filip Victor’s HL2 Update</a> for a more “vanilla” HL2 aesthetics with pimped graphics.</p>
<p>IMO Cinematic Mod deviates too much from the original. I like it too, but not so much as I like the HL2 Update Mod.</p>

            <p>It has some fantastic textures for the maps but I wouldn’t exactly recommend the models unless you’re turned on by slutty Alyx wearing all kinds of weird clothes, but luckily you can turn them off.</p>

            <p>It’s kind of interesting in it’s own right I suppose if it had to be, but I honestly can’t stand it. I tried to play through half life with it a while ago, but I just couldn’t finish it. Try it for yourself, it will certainly be an… experience. I wouldn’t recommend it though.</p>
