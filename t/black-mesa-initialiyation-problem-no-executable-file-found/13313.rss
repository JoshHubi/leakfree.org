    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-initialiyation-problem-no-executable-file-found/13313</link>
    <description>Hello, i have some problems with running BM. I have installed Steam and Sourse SDK base 2007, downloaded BM installed/extraxted to X:\Hry\Steam\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS. Restarted PC and started Steam. I saw BS in Library so i ran it. I worked nicely. Next day i wanned to play i havent seen it in Steam&#39;s Library, so i installed BS again, but didnt worked at all. Just a error message popped out that BS coudnt be started (no executable file found). Restartin PC, Steam, reinstalling did no effect. Pls help. 

Windows 8, 
Inte core i5 3,2GHz,
GeForce GT 730,
8GB DDR3</description>

            <p>Hm. Normally the problem is because the SDK 2007 is not installed correctly or the steam client has not been completely closed out and restarted.</p>
<p>Well, if it were me I would delete / re-install both sdk and black mesa, reboot the computer and then open up steam again to see if it finally shows in the library.</p>
