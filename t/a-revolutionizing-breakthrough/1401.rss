    <title>A revolutionizing breakthrough......</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-revolutionizing-breakthrough/1401</link>
    <description>I was just thinking about the mod and something came up in my mind: 
This mod will be special and unique in terms of creation, detail and length, and will mostly surpass any other existing mod.
Ive never heard of another mod that huge like this one, and with huge i mean:

- the team worked over 5 years on this one
- Looking at the original Half Life, this mod has a very long play-time as well
- the love, detail and dedication for this mod is stunning 
- everything is professionally done, from voice acting to level design...

I dont remember any other mod you can compare to Black mesa, so this will be definitely a breakthrough in the modding scene!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been following this forum for about a year now, myself, though I almost never post anywhere except the occasional off-topic thread. I guess I want to see how long I can go with a miniscule post-count. Or something like that.</p>
<p>While I see a pretty regular procession of Typical Internet Dickery, what keeps me coming back is the really twisted sense of humor (and irony) that turns up all the time. I’ve lost count of how many memes I’ve been exposed to just from reading the Laugh You Lose thread (which I check daily).</p>
<p>You get enough people in any public spot online and you’re going to see some jackassery. I’ve been online way too long to take serious offense at it. I just apply a grain of salt, imagine the person posting that sort of tripe as doing so while wearing a bear-suit (which makes it even funnier), and move on.</p>
<p>Oh, and to test Verde Flash’s theory:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Masturbation.</span></p>
<p>Let’s see if it works.</p>

            <p>Sorry to bring back something from one whole page ago, but I think 90% of Raminator’s posts as far as I’ve seen are right after a post involving the word “masturbate” or any of its forms.</p>
<p>It’s like the Bat-Signal, but different and stickier.</p>

            <p>Long time no see, Waffle. [COLOR=‘Red’]I’m moving this to off-topic, since it really has nothing to do with the mod.</p>
<p>Also Black Op, if you carry through any of your nonsense about destroying noobs and such, don’t expect to get away with it unpunished. If someone does something wrong, report them and we’ll deal with it, flaming them just compounds the problem.</p>

            <p>If anyone here seriously believes that this board is anywhere close to “horrible” as far as the community goes, they obviously haven’t been round the internets.</p>
<p>Hell, this is one of the most heavily moderated boards I’ve ever seen, and I have been a member of the PA boards for <span class="bbcode-i">years.</span></p>

<p>Giving n00bs mutual respect is a waste of time, since all they ever do is spit in your face while suggesting stupid ideas or performing other acts of idiocy. N00bs, therefore, must be expunged. They must be fought tooth and nail, and that fight happens on these very forums.</p>

<p>So what you’re saying is that it’s <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> like masturbation.</p>

</aside>
<p>to me it seems like you have some kind of live forum activity monitor which links you to a thread everytime it finds awesome words like “masturbation” or “George Washington” etc, because I really wasn’t surprised to see you commenting after Skaevola’s and aws’ post  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>But yeah, I did say this elsewhere, but I would gladly repeat that it’s just that such big hobby projects as BM are rarely seen in the games world, which makes it really outstanding.</p>

<p>Not really, he didn’t say <span class="bbcode-i">retards</span>, he said <span class="bbcode-i">assholes </span>and while the “just ban me already” drama is a fine example of not having the balls to support his own point of view, I tend to agree with him minus the gratuitous jab at the devs. There seems to be a general agreement that no mutual respect is required here and while hilarious moments may stem from this from time to time, the ugly generally far outweighs the sheer beauty of lol.</p>
<p>Especially for people used to adult and reasonably caustic forums. Most people here have a long way to go, and as the bastard child of steam forums / 4chan pseudo-superiority vent for teenagers / modding scene (see Venn diagram), these forums were bound to be on the rather far side of maturity and respect. Still, the amounts of 4channery and memedropping here are beyond ridiculous.</p>

<p>I’ve been a member of the Black Mesa Forums for almost as year, and there’s rarely been a dull moment! Everyone has a personality, rather than just a collection of soulless fat basement dwellers wasting their life away in front of the monitor. It’s like an uncensored television sitcom! I mean, what other forum community can inspire their own comic?</p>
