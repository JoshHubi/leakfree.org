    <title>about the citadel and some enemies of HL 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/about-the-citadel-and-some-enemies-of-hl-2/2171</link>
    <description>after replaying hl2, i still got questions:

- at the chapter where Gordon infiltrates the Citadel, there was some kind of giant hammer thing at the base of the building. At first, I thought it was some sort of bombimg system (I don&#39;t know if I used the correct word), but when I zommed in and used the crossbow&#39;s scope, that hammers were actually hitting the ground itself. Is it a raw matterial collector, as the ever-expanding metal borders around the citadel and Nova Prospekt?
-  Also, there was those tubes with (I really don&#39;t know) something inside. If it was a bombing system, there should be a movement on the tubes. what are being transported by them?

There are more questions, but I don&#39;t remember now. I will edit this post when I get them.

ps: changing video configuration doesn&#39;t solved the problem.</description>

<p>There are no legs. It’s all one big tower. You can see almost the whole dang thing in EP1, and there are no legs.</p>

            <p>no, the fusion reactor didn’t explode until the end of Episode 1, the suppression field was down at the beginning of Episode 1. The explosion at the end of HL2 was the Combine Teleportation station blowing up.</p>

            <p>But then why is it still going after the suppression field has been set up then? Maybe its task has been changed to something else? I thought that maybe it was just the citadel just mining downwards, and continuing to increase its size.</p>

            <p>Those moving pieces may be part of what keeps the suppression field running, or may be throwbacks to when the citadel was first being built. They didn’t have the suppression field set up immediately, and needed some big ass ant lion thumpers to keep the pests at bay until they could finish getting the citadel set up to broadcast the suppression field properly.</p>

<p>^This. Plus I also think that they’re used to balance the Citadel itself. Where you infiltrate it looks to be but a single “leg” of the Citadel, and given it’s so huge, I imagine there would be more, but given its immense height, I imagine that it would need to be balanced to stop it from simply toppling over into the city.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, what you see is the whole thing. It’s actually a bit larger than it looks, though.</p>

            <p>that’s my best guess. it explains why as soon as you get to the other side of those walls you see nothing except for a gigantic endlessly deep crater surrounding the combine citadel. It also fits with the combine philosophy of sucking every bit of useful material they can out of wherever they conquer.</p>

            <p>Oh so <span class="bbcode-i">that’s</span> what those walls are for. I could never figure it out. I just assumed the Combine used them for blocking access to increasingly larger areas of the city, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I do like the idea that they simply dropped the Citadel into C17 from their own universe, imagine the science going into that. Not to mention the sheer awesomeness. :awesome:</p>

            <p>actually, that’s a pretty awesome idea. That they’re actually moving around to offset the natural sway resulting from it’s excessive height.</p>
<p>I also figured that their motion might in some way power the “eating wall” that surrounds the citadel. It’s constantly walking itself out wider as the combine apparently are mining out as they go.</p>

            <p>^This. Plus I also think that they’re used to balance the Citadel itself. Where you infiltrate it looks to be but a single “leg” of the Citadel, and given it’s so huge, I imagine there would be more, but given its immense height, I imagine that it would need to be balanced to stop it from simply toppling over into the city.</p>
<p>I want to know how the hell they got the Citadel there in the first place. Given the massive hole(s) it’s sat in, was it simply “dropped” in from the Combine homeworld? Or has it been built in situe?</p>

            <p>The Citadel’s pounders are unexplained, but presumably used to scare away antlions from the city. And to make  delicious flatbread.</p>

            <p>after replaying hl2, i still got questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>at the chapter where Gordon infiltrates the Citadel, there was some kind of giant hammer thing at the base of the building. At first, I thought it was some sort of bombimg system (I don’t know if I used the correct word), but when I zommed in and used the crossbow’s scope, that hammers were actually hitting the ground itself. Is it a raw matterial collector, as the ever-expanding metal borders around the citadel and Nova Prospekt?</li>
<li>Also, there was those tubes with (I really don’t know) something inside. If it was a bombing system, there should be a movement on the tubes. what are being transported by them?</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more questions, but I don’t remember now. I will edit this post when I get them.</p>
<p>ps: changing video configuration doesn’t solved the problem.</p>
