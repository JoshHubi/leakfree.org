    <title>Achievements not working?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/achievements-not-working/9896</link>
    <description>Well, the game itself works flawlessly, but whenever I select &quot;Achievements&quot; in the main menu, it give me the following message:

&quot;You must be logged into Steam to unlock or view achievements&quot;

And I assure you, I&#39;m logged into Steam just fine, so I have no idea what can be causing it. Is this because the game isn&#39;t officially on Steam yet, or is it a bug specific to me? I talked to my friends, and they say that while still kinda buggy, they can view their achievements fine. It kinda bugs me, I&#39;m a bit obsessed with achievements  :stuck_out_tongue: 

Any help would be appreciated.</description>

            <p>For me, a restart of steam did the trick. I guess it’s a steam related problem.</p>
