    <title>Bugs I have encounterd, When will you release an update?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bugs-i-have-encounterd-when-will-you-release-an-update/14347</link>
    <description>The first glitch is that all npcs are not using their revolver.
The hivehand is missing from surface tension.
After I kill an alien grunt or vortiguant and then quick load I see their bodies as if they are not dead they are just standing.
I get frame rate drops in the Chapter RP after the smashing vent and in LC before xen.</description>

<p>Right, and the 2012 release had significant problems of its own, many of which we have addressed here. They are unique beasts in that regards. The difference is, the 2012 version is set in stone. This one is not. We’re updating and fixing things, and adding things.</p>

<p>Probably, but the free version didn’t have so many features as the current one, such as Multiplayer and Steam Workshop. There has been a lot more happening since 2012, although there still are many to fix. That’s why it’s EA dude, the Multiplayer is far from complete since we’re going to see more maps and mods, SP still has bugs, and there is no Xen. Like I said, it’ll take some time, but it will be perfect in the end. We just have to wait.</p>

<p>Early access? I don’t understand: this mod has been out since 2012 right? What do I have ‘early access’ to aside from the unreleased Xen section and a ton of glitches that are ruining my first play-through of what should be an amazing game?  I am also having lots of issues particularly with bad Vortigaunt AI and a few other things like bad animations for the sprites moving up and down stairs. Would I be better off just downloading the non-Steam version of the mod?</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re kinda belittling the devs’ work, that is seriously not cool. They’ve been working hard to improve the game since the mod release. Case in point, it <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> a game now, and not just a mod. That’s a lot bigger of a step than you’re giving it credit for. They had to work to make everything you see in-game, and don’t have a magic “fix it” button that they just need to push a few more times for things to be working.</p>

<p>The first three issues you’ve encountered are already known by the devs for quite some time, they’ll be fixed sometime in the future.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s Early Access, there are still many to fix and also improve. It’ll take a while, but it will be perfect in the end.</p>
