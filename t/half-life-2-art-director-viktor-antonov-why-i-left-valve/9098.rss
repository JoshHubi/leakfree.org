&quot;I left precisely when they stopped making epic, triple-As, which was Half-Life 2, since then, they were episodes. Valve is a great place, but I&#39;m interested in projects, not in companies&quot;

So it means that they are not working on new HL? After words from Gabe in this short movie with crowbar, i thought they are actually working but slow.

Sorry for my english</description>

            <p>When HL2 was in production, it was a huge game. That’s why Viktor wanted to work on it. After that, they started doing the episodes, and he didn’t want to be a part of it anymore. I think you’ve forgotten about the episodes.</p>
