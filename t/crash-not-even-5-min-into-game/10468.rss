    <title>Crash not even 5 min into game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-not-even-5-min-into-game/10468</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m getting a crash to desktop barely even like five minutes into the game, still on the intro tram sequence, right after the large security gate closes behind the tram and it goes into loading. I have uploaded a crash mdmp file.

Here&#39;s my computer specs too (kind of old, but it still runs most games really well): 
Intel Core2 Quad Processor Q6600
4096 MB system memory, 750 GB hard drive
Nvidia GeForce 8500 GT Graphics Card
Runs Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit
