    <description>Hey this is my first post  :stuck_out_tongue:  Just wondering What skins are there for the headcrab zombies. Apart from the obvious scientist, It was cool seeing zombies with army uniform in op force .</description>

            <p>While I would like to see them (for the various reasons that have been named), there won’t be much point for a model if you only get to see it once or twice throughout the entire game, unless the devs decide to add some additional zombies here and there.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I’m not sure a headcrab could bite through a beret with that much awesome-padding. I mean, they pretty heavily awesome-armoured those things. You can tell just by looking at them.</p>

<p>I think what you’re forgetting is just how much of Gordon Freeman’s Survival was circumstantial. Gordon Freeman is like Frodo Baggins bringing the ring to Mt. Doom. He never fights the main alien militia, he’s a blip that flies in under everyone’s radar only really ever dealing with the stragglers and enemy offensives that were coordinated at the last second while they were off balance, and then manages to slip through to the backlines and start causing havoc that can’t even be tracked by the enemy properly cause it’s only one guy.<br>
There were numerous cases where GF just happened to be in the right place at the right time to not get blown up by a tactical strike made by the HECU or Xen forces while they’re busy fighting each other. Or where something was breaking down at just the right time for its explosive failure to be able to take out an enemy that couldn’t even be damaged at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah, because Gordon’s attack on the citadel was completely stealthy. Those soldiers never even noticed him. :hmph:</p>

            <p>The important question is if it is worth extra development time for an insignificant model such as an HECU zombie, I’m sorry but IMO the the answer is no.  Security and scientist zombies suffice.</p>

            <p>The “circumstantial nature of GF’s survivial” was totally lost on me until you mentioned it.</p>
<p>I’m just finishing up Half-Life in eager anticipation of the May 1st release of BM,  and I notice that part of the genius of the game was the way you never really felt you had the whole picture.  Playing through multiple times, you see the dead ends and corridors snaking you to the next area, but at the time you actually realize what it would be like to not really know what the hell is going on!</p>

<p>I completely agree with that point, but to show how bad things got, I think it simply makes more sense to see slaughtered HECU bodies lying around instead of encountering zombified HECU.  I doubt HECU would go down without a fight or even allow themselves to be zombified, they would most likely kill themselves or their squadmates before it comes to zombification.  Besides, the headcrabs are the least of their problems and not difficult to defeat when trained in combat and armed with weapons, I think they can handle them if Gordon and his crowbar are capable.</p>

<p>I think what you’re forgetting is just how much of Gordon Freeman’s Survival was circumstantial. Gordon Freeman is like Frodo Baggins bringing the ring to Mt. Doom. He never fights the main alien militia, he’s a blip that flies in under everyone’s radar only really ever dealing with the stragglers and enemy offensives that were coordinated at the last second while they were off balance, and then manages to slip through to the backlines and start causing havoc that can’t even be tracked by the enemy properly cause it’s only one guy.<br>
There were numerous cases where GF just happened to be in the right place at the right time to not get blown up by a tactical strike made by the HECU or Xen forces while they’re busy fighting each other. Or where something was breaking down at just the right time for its explosive failure to be able to take out an enemy that couldn’t even be damaged at the time.</p>
<p>The other point you’re forgetting is that HECU has never gone up against ALIEN forces before. Theoretically, neither has GF, but he’s still supposed to be a research scientist and therefor has a slight edge in analyzing the Xen forces for weaknesses and figuring out how to use alien technology.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that he has a magical ability to carry 17 different weapons and can still fit through an air vent probably goes a long way towards his overall success when compared to the HECU.</p>
<p>However for just surviving the headcrabs, you still need to remember my initial point that the HECU were front lining against alien forces while GF is only picking up the tail end of a lot of the individual skirmishes. When the entire force is concentrating on just surviving the main alien assault, it is completely reasonable for some guy who got injured and fell back for cover to get ambushed by a headcrab and not have a chance to fight back, nor have anyone to cover him because everyone else was busy. And sure the HECU might choose to kill himself instead of becoming a zombie, but how do you know they even would realize that could happen to them until its already too late?</p>

<p>What a bunch of jackasses some of you BM forum people are!  We roaches come in with a moderate interest in an upcoming mod, and you guys treat us like we’re pissing in your pool!</p>
<p>“Have you even [I]looked[I] at the media page?” “Please don’t double post”.  Seriously man, why be a turd?  You’re terrified that when the game is released it will be just another game with great experiences and ones that are lacking.  How about taking it easy and not getting your panties in a wad because some people shined a flashlight into your clubhouse and took down your “no one that isn’t an asshole” sign?</p>

<p>With regards to making sense and logic, its not crucial because HL is just a video game.  In the end I just want the mod to be released ASAP and don’t want more development time to add pointless zombified HECU.</p>
