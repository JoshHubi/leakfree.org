    <title>[CRASH] &quot;Forget About Freeman&quot;, pressing Esc in a specific place</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-forget-about-freeman-pressing-esc-in-a-specific-place/10931</link>
    <description>In &quot;Forget About Freeman&quot;, in the area where the indoor tank and the marines fight against the Agunts and Vortigaunts inside a garage (photo attached), after killing everyone, I pressed &quot;Esc&quot; to save the game: in that moment, the menu not even showing up, the game crashed.
I reloaded, re-killed everyone, moved on for a few step (but staying always in the same area), and hit &quot;Esc&quot;: the game crashed again. And again.
The same happened also in the hallway parallel to the same garage (where there are 2 turrets at the end). For a total of 4 times in a row.

I went through the area without hitting &quot;Esc&quot;, and when I got far enough, I tried once more: this time, the menu popped up normally.

So I suggest that this weird kind of problem is connected to that specific zone, as it never happened before nor after, but just there, and 4 times in a row: it cannot be a casual thing.

As usual, the minidumps are attached.
