    <title>Remastered Health &amp; HEV Charging Station Sounds</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/remastered-health-hev-charging-station-sounds/14264</link>
    <description>I made these a long time ago back when the mod first came out. These are the original HL1 sound files, remastered, AND remixed with the new BM sounds.

Original work by...

Valve
Crowbar Collective

Believe it or not, this did take some amount of work. (HEV was easy enough) but mixing the HL1 health recharge station with the new BM sound took a couple hours of work in order to sound appealing and not &#39;off&#39;.

<p>The HEV one is passable enough, but the health station, the sounds conflict way too much and it just sounds annoying.</p>

<p>Funny - I’m getting the opposite on the workshop… The problem is getting the beeps of the BM sound to properly line up with the timing of the old health charger rhythm…</p>
