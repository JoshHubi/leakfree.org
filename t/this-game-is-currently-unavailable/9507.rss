            <p>Hey Darkplague<br>
Thank you, it worked for me too !</p>
<p>There must have been some corrupt files in the sdk laying somewhere else. Also that file had to be staying even when i delete sdk2007 trough the tools menue  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Thanks mate!</p>

            <p>Finally got it working after hours of stuffing around, closed steam, deleted source sdk base 2007 folder in steamapps , as well as every source and source 2007 gcf (for safe measure), opened steam and ran black mesa souce, said it needed to download source sdk base 2007, after it finished downloaded ran black mesa source and it opened. Finnally.</p>
<p>Should be noted tf2, hl2 dm and my other source mods work as well now.<br>
There might be an easier quicker way to fix this but i had enough and was easier to redownload everything.</p>

            <p>Anyone happen to know if there’s a place to re-download Source engine updates?  Seems like this one that happened on Monday corrupted some stuff.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a lot of errors like this in the past. Disable any firewalls, security suites and antivirus and it should work fine (at least, it worked for me).</p>

<p>Yep sure enough, (prob should of checked this first) cant launch any other source mod either, went to launch sdk base 2007… same error so deleted local content and reinstalling, will post if i get it working.</p>

<p>Also found that HL2: Deathmatch AND TF2 (which was previously working) give me the same error.  I also tried another mod (Dear Esther), and that also was “unavailable”.  All other source games, including HL2, Episode 1, Episode 2, Lost Coast, and HL1: Source work fine.</p>
<p>Verified GCF on HL2: Deathmatch, deleted local files, scrubbed registry and reinstalled, still “unavailable”.</p>
<p>Valve released an update on Monday that affected TF2, HL2: DM, and DoD : S.  They broke something.</p>

<p>Yep, did all that.  I also redownloaded the torrent.  Completely reinstalled my Steam client (saving the steamapps folder).  Nothing works.</p>

            <p>On that note, try verifying the md5sums. They should be in a file called BlackMesa.md5. If you downloaded a torrent, you should be good (since torrent files contain hashes of all the files, and are themselves hashed).</p>
