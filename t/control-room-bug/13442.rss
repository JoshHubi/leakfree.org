    <title>Control Room Bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/control-room-bug/13442</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t played the game in a few days so i thought i would go back in and try it some more. This happens right after I get the suit at the beginning of the game.
 
I go out of the room where the elevator takes you up and none of the NPC&#39;s are talking anymore and I have part of some words on the lower right of the screen(see screenshot). When I reached the control room I had no way of exiting. I reloaded my save twice to see if it did it both times and it did. The control room is in the screenshot.
