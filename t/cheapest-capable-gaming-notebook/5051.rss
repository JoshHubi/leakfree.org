    <title>Cheapest, Capable Gaming Notebook?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cheapest-capable-gaming-notebook/5051</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been looking around and I&#39;m having trouble finding a capable, cheaper mobile gaming rig. My price cap is $800, and I was considering this:

[b]Asus - Laptop / Intel® Core™ i3 Processor / 14&quot; Display / 4GB Memory / 500GB Hard Drive - Black[/b]
[url]https://www.bestbuy.com/site/Asus+-+Laptop+/+Intel%26%23174;+Core%26%23153;+i3+Processor+/+14%22+Display+/+4GB+Memory+/+500GB+Hard+Drive+-+Black/9964891.p?id=1218206200334&amp;skuId=9964891[/url]

[b]Quick Specs Rundown:[/b]
Product Features
Intel® Core™ i3-330UM mobile processor
Features a 1066MHz frontside bus, 3MB L2 cache and 1.20GHz processor speed.
Intel® Core™ i3 processor
Features smart 4-way processing performance for HD quality computing. Intel® HD graphics provide extra graphics power for your laptop when you need it.
4GB DDR3 memory
For multitasking power.
Multiformat DVD±RW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support
Records up to 8.5GB of data or 4 hours of video using compatible DVD+R DL and DVD-R DL media.
14&quot; LED-backlit LCD high-definition widescreen display
With 1366 x 768 resolution delivers vivid detail and clarity.
500GB Serial ATA hard drive (5400 rpm)
Offers spacious storage and fast read/write times.
NVIDIA GeForce 310M graphics with Optimus Technology
With 1GB video memory for intense detail. Realtek audio with two 2W stereo speakers for lush audio. HDMI output for flexible connectivity options.


I really only want to play CS: S on it, and beyond that just have a solid notebook. The proc speed is a little slow, which is disconcerting, but what do you guys think?

And what is everyone&#39;s opinion on refurbished notebooks?

Thanks in advance!

            <p>Following on from my previous post, the Clevo B5100M looks like the perfect system for you. It has an excellent balance of portability to system performance, and utilises Optimus technology to balance them out.</p>
<p>The base spec is excellent, and is only 89 dollars above your budget first hand.</p>
<p>Check it out:</p>

<p>Hi Jaeti,</p>
<p>Your budget will allow you to pick up a very good laptop in America (damn the rediculous component prices in Europe  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ).</p>
<p>I would highly recommend a refurbished Asus laptop with your budget in mind. I have been doing some research into purchasing a cheap gaming laptop for my cousin, and came accross a BestBuy exclusive model of Asus laptop that will blitz through anything you throw at it.</p>
<p><a href="https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ASUS-G51Vx-RX05-RX5-15-6-P7350-1GB-GTX-260M-GAMING-/120604224113?pt=Laptops_Nov05" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ASUS-G51Vx-RX05-RX5-15-6-P7350-1GB-GTX-260M-GAMING-/120604224113?pt=Laptops_Nov05</a></p>
<p>This users “ebay shop” has a large selection of affordable gaming laptops with specifications similar to those found in an alienware 15x.</p>
<p>Another excellent model is the 16" version:</p>
<p><a href="https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ASUS-G60VX-RBBX05-2-13GHz-320GB-HD-16-0-Win-7-GTX-260M-/220652149375?pt=Laptops_Nov05" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ASUS-G60VX-RBBX05-2-13GHz-320GB-HD-16-0-Win-7-GTX-260M-/220652149375?pt=Laptops_Nov05</a></p>
<p>Alternatively if you are looking to purchase a brand new system, try to pick one up with the following specs as a minium:</p>
<p>CPU: i3 330<br>
GPU: Nvidia Geforce 330M / 250M<br>
HDD: 320GB 7200 RPM<br>
Screen: 1366x768 WLED<br>
RAM: 4GB DDR3 1066 mhz</p>
<p>Ideally a 250M GPU will outperform a 330M, but if you can pick up a system with a 260M it will not let you down.</p>
<p>If you are willing to save a little more money i would strongly recommend a Sager/Clevo 15.4" gaming laptop. I own this particular model and its performance is breathtaking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sagernotebook.com/index.php?page=product_info&amp;model_name=NP8690" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.sagernotebook.com/index.php?page=product_info&amp;model_name=NP8690</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately it is a considerable price hike… with your current budget and situation i would recommend a refurbished Asus with a core 2 duo cpu and geforce 260m gpu.</p>
<p>Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p>-Zal</p>
<p>Edit: As you will be using the system for older generation games, a system with an i3 CPU and Geforce 330M GPU will be more than enough, however as these systems still cost roughly the same as a refurbished Asus with a 260M i would still go for the Asus.</p>

            <p>Wait, an ATI Radeon 5145 is a re-branding of an NVidia card?  Specifically, a 4570 (a card number that NVidia isn’t currently using)?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The mobility radeon 5145 is a 4570 re-branded at manufacture’s request because nvidia has so polluted their product numbering. The <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/ATI-Mobility-Radeon-HD-5165.24579.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">4570</a> is roughly equal, but more powerful than the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-310M.22439.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">310</a>. I wouldn’t worry so much about the video ram quantity. Even the Intel Extreme Graphics Decelerator brags about being able to access up to a gig and a half of (system) memory. Remember that both the PS3 and the Xbox360 has 512mb of ram TOTAL, for system and graphics.</p>
<p>What is really needed is a <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/ATI-Mobility-Radeon-HD-5165.24579.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">mobility radeon 4650</a> or better. It has a (slightly) higher pixel fillrate than the xbox 360 gpu (which is also made by ati), and it can be found in laptops around your price point.</p>
<p>Edit: And do note: The Mobility Radeon 5870 (a very high end laptop GPU) is basically a downclocked desktop 5770. You can get a factory <span class="bbcode-i">overclocked</span> 5770 card for as little as $170. I’m a college kid with little disposable income myself, and I am stuck with a pentium 4/Radeon 2600xt rig for now and a huge need to replace the laptop I bring to school (at around the same price-point as you). I am prioritizing getting a laptop first, and when I had the above realization about the 5770 I gave up on saving for a laptop with a discreet GPU. I instead focused on (vertical) screen real estate. Maybe I’ll have a chance to swap out my desktop sometime in spring 2011.</p>

<p>Core i3 330 is a dual core quad threaded CPU.<br>
Also, it’s not too hard to find a laptop that does okay on most current games. Mine wasn’t really for gaming, but it handles it well.<br>
Only paid 700 bucks for the Acer ( not a fan of the brand but meh ) Aspire AS5740G-5323. Has the i3 330, 4GB of ram, AMD 5740 GPU and windows 7 64 bit.<br>
I’ve had no problems at all with it ( though it doesn’t have the full left hand shift key which I hate on laptops ). The point being, even a little work laptop seems to be able to handle most modern games. I even play BFBC2 on her.</p>

            <p>$800 isn’t much cash to spend on a decent gaming laptop, but he’s not talking about a massive rig here. All he wants to do is play CS:S and the laptops listed in his price range are more than capable of playing CS:S on decent settings. The i3 with the 1GB nvidia GPU is MORE than capable of handling this game.</p>

            <p>from personal experience i would have to say that if you want a good asus your gonna have to spend a lot. the last asus laptop i had worked perfectly fine for about a year, then i just got a line of dead pixels through the screen. shortly there after i found my dog(small pug mix) had stepped on it when he jumped up on the couch and the fan started to vibrate all the time. i called asus support and they were not at all helpful. i would go with the Toshiba you mentioned depending on where the comp was gonna be more. your house or girlfriends.</p>
<p>p.s. why you getting your girl a laptop? flowers don’t say i love you anymore?</p>

            <p>The specs are a little weak for what I would consider a ‘gaming laptop’, if you want to play any next-gen games with any amount of detail anyway.</p>
<p>Do you really need the extra portability? You could get a better desktop computer, within budget, by assembling it yourself.</p>

            <p>When I said playable framerates I meant 15 - 25 fps. For me thats playable.</p>
<p>The GT 320M is just a rebadged 9600M GT with fewer shaders; IMO not worth it. Price is good though.</p>

            <p>Oh, haha. Alrighty, well. Point taken. But, I decided on a deal on Newegg, if you’re curious.</p>

<p>Can’t go wrong with that $80 Accidental Warranty plan, either.</p>

            <p>No, we’re saying you shouldn’t get a gaming notebook because that would be dumb.</p>
<p>Also, the i3 is a tri-core.</p>

            <p>I’m not an NVidia fanboy, so much that my current and last cards were NVidia, so I know their current numbering scheme and have a better idea where the video technology is in relation to what I have now.  The last ATI card I had was a Radeon 9600 I bought in celebration for Half-Life 2’s release, so I’m way out of the loop with ATI.</p>
<p>Before THAT, the last video card I had was the ATI All-In-Wonder 128.  I thought it was SO COOL how it had a whopping 16MB OF VIDEO RAM!! YEAH!!  NOT EVEN BILL GATES HAS A MORE BEEFY VIDEO CARD THAN THIS!  (Feels glad that he can finally play Descent 3 smoothly)</p>

            <p>I’m a real Asus fan, but the cheaper the better. The notebook will primarily be used as my girlfriend’s school PC. I have my own gaming rig, self built, but lately my life has taken a more mobile direction. I have lower expectations, however, since my main game is good 'ol CS Source. That’s a hot rig, russilker, but is definitely way more performance than I need.</p>
<p>This seems a much better deal than I previously posted:<br>
