    <title>Beeping Whenever a key is pushed and Slowdown</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/beeping-whenever-a-key-is-pushed-and-slowdown/9560</link>
    <description>Randomly the game will beep every time I push a button. Quitting the game and reloading it remedies the problem for a few minutes. Also, for example if I push and hold &#39;W&#39; to make Gordon walk forward the game just continually goes &quot;beep beep beep beep&quot; and the animations gets jerky. 

The game randomly slows down as well. But I have never had this problem in any other source game. Just curious if there are any quick fixes for this.</description>

            <p>The first thing I thought was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StickyKeys" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">‘Sticky Keys’</a> ?</p>
<p>Have you guys never heard of it? Press your ‘modifier’ key too many times (or for too long) and suddenly the computer starts to beep every time you press something. It’s to help disabled people.</p>
<p>Sounds like you guys got a case of the sticky keys!! <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like Lexa2 picked up on this as well. Hahahah maybe unknowingly we went to school together XD!</p>

            <p>My solution was to move all the assigned keys one to the right.  The problem seemed to be tied to either the Shift or Ctrl key.  I haven’t had a problem since, give it a try.</p>

<p>BTW it’s a really clever idea to check these. IIRC there’re a “features” in Windows that would make “sticky keys” and alike automatically kick in in case you would press and hold shift key for more than 7 of 10 seconds or if you would press shift, ctrl or alt key a lot of times in a row during relatively small time frame. Thus this problem could really be accessibility helpers kicking, at least for some of reports above.</p>

            <p>I have all those key options turned off, it’s nothing like that. Works fine in other non-Source games. If I have music playing or play in windows mode and have a  browser up the music or ads in the browser will still work when the stutter happens. So only the game stutters.</p>
<p>The source engine has a built in video recorder. I will try to make a video and post it.</p>

<p>I’m wondering if is it possible to record how the problem does look like on video using FRAPS or DXtory or some other game recording tool. Could you please try recording it and posting a video on youtube in case you’d be able to successfully record it?</p>

            <p>It may or may not be the same as the other thread. Mine isn’t stuttering spontaneously and then crashing by itself. It doesn’t seem like the other guy here is having that issue either. It just beeps and freezes as you hold a key down. If you mouse look while it’s beeping/frozen the command is registered so then when you release the key, your viewpoint snaps to where you looked towards.</p>
<p>It’s just an annoying glitch. The source of which eludes me. I also tried another keyboard, albeit another microsoft keyboard, to no avail. I would include a MDMP but no crash to dump.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wouldn’t be so sure it’s a Valve’s fault as there are a lot of people who not experience this problem. I’m still pretty sure it most likely to be related to the recently updated drivers or something of that kind. As you mention that you’ve got just the same problems with Garry’s Mod - had there been any updates to the Source engine and/or Mod published in a days prior you started to hit this bug? If the answer is yes - then most likely that I’m wrong in suspecting drivers and it’s really a Source-engine bug.</p>

            <p>I’m 100% positive it has nothing to do with hardware. I’ve been playing Garry’s Mod for years with the same hardware and it also just recently started doing this. Just bad timing for when Black Mesa was released.</p>
<p>It’s just Valve’s programming. Not sure where to report it to them though.</p>

It’d be pretty interesting to compare and try find similarities between the systems suffering from this issue. Be sure to include motherboard models and keyboard models and connection interface as this bug might be related to a specific motherboard type of to a specific keyboard model and/or vendor.</p>

            <p>I have this problem too and it makes it extremely annoying to play when it happens every 5 minutes after restarting. I thought this was Black Mesa, but it is now also happening in Garry’s Mod so it’s not Black Mesa’s fault but probably something Valve screwed up in the Source engine.</p>
<p>You can hold down another button like ALT and it will make it stop if you’re tired of restarting.</p>
<p>The beeping isn’t a system beep sounds more like the beginning sound of a Half Life medkit that replays. I haven’t noticed any key combinations causing it as I can just press W at some point and it will start its crap. But the game will be stuck in a stutter(everything else running on the computer runs fine while it stutters) and doesn’t quit until you let go of the key. The problem randomly comes and goes.</p>

            <p>I guess this is because you use USB keyboard. PS/2 keyboards don’t have this problem, I think.</p>

            <p>I had this exact problem myself. It was caused by holding Ctrl and Space at the same time. If you remap the Duck key to something else (I used Q), you should be able to crouch jump as normal without getting this odd bug.</p>

            <p>I have this problem too.<br>
It doesn’t happen <em>every</em> time I press a button, but often. Often enough to make the game more or less unplayable.</p>
<p>So far it has happened in two different scenarios, once when I used the microwave in the beginning, and several times when I press elevator and door buttons.</p>
<p>After that, each time I click any key on my keyboard, a button “beep” is heard and the game stutters. If I only move around with the mouse there is no stutter.</p>

            <p>Randomly the game will beep every time I push a button. Quitting the game and reloading it remedies the problem for a few minutes. Also, for example if I push and hold ‘W’ to make Gordon walk forward the game just continually goes “beep beep beep beep” and the animations gets jerky.</p>
<p>The game randomly slows down as well. But I have never had this problem in any other source game. Just curious if there are any quick fixes for this.</p>
