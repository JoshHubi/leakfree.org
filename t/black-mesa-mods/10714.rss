        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For all the people wanting to change damage as far as numbers are concerned, just take a look at skill.cfg in your /BMS/cfg folder.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think a mods can fix a number of issues I have with Black Mesa.<br>
-General combat could use some improvements. In HL and HL2, you could “stun lock” enemies if you continually put damage into them, allowing you to have some degree of control over what your enemies do. In BM, combat just turns into either a slugfest where you both just hammer each other or a “hide behind corner and shoot the enemy when he walks around it” fest.</p>
<p>-Combat against HECUs is generally unbalanced, as they apparently have eyes in the back of their heads, they can snipe you with SMGs and shotguns, and as said earlier, only a few weapons (crossbow, .357) are actually useful against them. Also due to the clutter on some of the maps, marines can shoot you while you cannot see them through several crevices in between a bunch of boxes.</p>
<p>-Weapon placement can be fixed. I don’t have an issue with the crowbar appearing later. It’s just that sometime you aren’t given the right weapon for the situation. For example in the dam fight in surface tension, you are given no long range weapons except for tau ammo against the chopper, and it is nearly impossible on hard to advance up to the dam. I would put a crossbow ammo drop where the dead guard and health pack are located above the dam. There are more examples like this, but this was the most apparent one to me.</p>
<p>-Map design could use some improvements. Areas where you have to advance up on a machine gun or large group of enemies provide no cover whatsoever, and instead force you to run up a hallway or try to magnum snipe the enemies. In HL and HL2, you were always provided with ample cover when needed. You would always have a chance to slowly advance on a turret by dashing between crates or hide from a chopper in HL and HL2, but in BM almost no options are given.</p>
<p>-Voice acting is a minor problem, and some more memorable character could have been made. I don’t have a huge beef with the VA.</p>
<p>-BUTTONS are super hard to find sometimes. If buttons could be given a consistent look and location, puzzles would be a lot less frustrating. For example in Lambda Core, it took me half an hour trying to find the button for the maintenance shaft since all the other door buttons were put on the same wall as the door, and this button was put on an adjacent wall. Also, buttons you can interact with are not given a unique and consistent look that is identifiable from non-interactable buttons, so the player ends up spamming “e” on any sort of panel.</p>
<p>-Tying in with buttons, puzzles are sometimes unclear. In HL and HL2, the player would always be shown the objective and then forced to figure out a way to get to the objective. This isn’t always the case in BM, and some “puzzles” just end up resulting in wandering around until the appropriate button or objective was found.</p>
<p>Sorry if I make it look like I don’t like the game. I think the storytelling is fine and the game is great, it’s just a some surprisingly frustrating gameplay elements could be easily fixed with some playtesting.</p>

            <p>exactly! i think there is already climbing animations in hl2, so I guess it can be done without much effort, however making it look good would stll be challenging.</p>

            <p>I’d love if your friends were able to overcome obstacles like ladders or boxes that prevent them from following you in some points. It’s weird when you and your friendly officer of security went through Hell together to survive, and suddenly he decides not to go further because of a ladder being too high or some tables blocking the way.</p>
<p>It’s like, “Hey, we’ve just nearly died to find an exit, and now I won’t even try to crouch under this door. I think I’ll just die here then, good luck to you!”</p>
<p>I can understand why scientists are unwilling to go - they have convenient arguments most of the time, but officers of security? They were trained to fight, yet they pass on the easiest obstacles…</p>
<p>I’m not complaining - I love the game, and I love the allies you have. All the interactions and etc - it’s amazing. But if this is a “what if” kind of question, that’s my wish ^___^</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Here is what I would like to have modded (and am willing to contribute to myself). But of course I will wait until patches and the final version of BM comes out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make the HECU a bit more fun to combat. (I know that some people say that it is realistic that they are so strong. But they totally miss the point that the .357 is the most effective weapon against them. Then why would anybody give machineguns to the marines if they would be even more effective with a cheaper .357)<br>
I would make it so that they have a slower reaction time so that you can face and kill one of a group in a more or less uncovered place but then have to resort to a more strategic place but you are able to come out and run from one cover to anotehr (while firing) without instantly being hit (a soldier needs some fractions of a second to aim too, you know). I am not saying to make them easier, but the gunplay a bit more fun than just to aim to head from cover with .357.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the missing parts of Surface Tension and at the same time giving a better feel of the “Marines are overrun by aliens … let’s get out of here” feel. Maybe have some variables that the HECU aren’t as effective against aliens as they are against Gordon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bit more visual action in the skyboxes of the outer levels where you hear distant battles going on, but don’t see anything but a cloudless, blue sky. And also showing more Mantas in the sky that actually beat the human forces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT_<br>
I also would make the crossbow-zoom independant from the normal zoom, so it can be tweaked via autoexe, because I think the crossbow zoom should have less mouse sensitivity.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Since we are talking about dreams, I will post what I would like my hardcore mode fro Black Mesa:</p>
<p>-Weapons do more damage (example, 9 mm should be able to kill in 2 shots to the head, 1 to the face, 5 or 6 to the dorso and criple NPC when shooting at limbs)</p>
<p>-Vorts should deal more damage, 23 at least .</p>
<p>-HEV suit should absorb damage progresibly ( 10 % damage absortion at 20 charge, up to 50% damage absortion when fully charged)</p>
<p>-less ammo laying around, dead guards should give a random number (between 0 to 3 ) of magazines, soldiers a bit more.</p>
<p>-HECU should use granades more often, and also the granade launcher.</p>
<p>-Agrunts shold fire on the move, charge at you and trow stuff at you at high speeds, their health should also be boosted and would require at least 20 bullets to kill, and also make them inmune in the chest area (the one protected by the armor plates) to conventional weapons.</p>
<p>-M16’s should be used by the HECU on the surfice, with the benefit of having longer range, more damage (at least 15 to the player at point blank) and less fall damage over distance.</p>
<p>-Ladder climbing guards! I want my little army to follow me to the dead  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>-special weapons such as the gluon and gauss gun should “gib without killing”, example, firing a bolt of the gauss to the leg of a hecu would rip it off and leave the guy screaming on the floor.</p>
<p>-rocked launcher soldiers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>-crowbar with an special attack, that is slow, but deals more damage, used to smash heads to unaware enemys</p>
<p>-machineguns! SAWs, M60s, etc. all used by the HECU and able to be used by the player, trading off some of your other weapons.</p>
<p>-more variety to the Alien army. Hecu has soldiers with smgs, shotguns, sniper rifles, basookas, et,cetc. Agrunts should come with a melee variant, equiped with a shield and a huge saw on the arm</p>
<p>-mounted Alien weponary!</p>
<p>-dont know what else xD</p>

            <p>I know it’s  not going to happen but I would love to see Shepherd’s story like this. (Opposing Force was awesome.)or Even Blue Shift or Decay. it’s just dreaming though I suppose. But I would also love to see some expansions on existing areas of the game. (it just kinda felt short to me.)</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>positive things first: Black mesa ist to 85 percent amazing!</p>
<p>but i would like to see in forthcoming mods to the mod:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vortigaunts attacks taking longer to charge, like in original half life. it looked very cool and still looks very cool when they charge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>completing the missing surface tension sections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CUT residue processing to the half or less (i really hated it already in the original game, i wish the developer of that map would have vanished too during development like the surface tension guy, lol)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make hecu marines less strong and accurate, xen aliens more strong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even add more scripted sequences and dialogues with hecus, cause i love them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let the hecu marines mention gordon freeman in the later course of the game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more fights between hecus and xen aliens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let more vortigaunts and alien grunts appear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more different speakers for scientists and security guards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>panther eye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at least a few dead corpes of office and storage workers. 2 or 3 throughout the whole game would be enought. for more believability. (there are so much storage areas and none sign of any storage workers? come on… )</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>maybe all or something of this will be realised in the future via patches from the developers of black mesa or by (other) modders…</p>

            <p>Mods to a mod eh? I wouldnt mind seeing more alien vs HECU battles (adding some alien grunts and slaves to the other end of the dam for instance), adding in the Gravity gun, perhaps adding the m4 as a separate weapon (rather then a skin job on the mp5),  and some general balance issues.</p>

            <p>So, Im assuming most of you have already played to the end and have enjoyed the expirence as much as I did  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (minus some minor annoyences) , now what? mods of course! what mods are you waiting for? what mods would you like to play?</p>
<p>Personally, i want a hardcore mod, where enemys do the same damage to you and amunitions becomes less plentfull :3</p>
