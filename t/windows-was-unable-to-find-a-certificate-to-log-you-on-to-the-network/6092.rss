            <p>Maybe the network has a certificate? I dunno where/what the network is, but try asking the network admin (if there is one). Otherwise, fuck knows.</p>

            <p>press start, type network connections, press enter. then double click on the wireless adapter. Click repair/diagnose… sometimes it helps with random error messages, but if that doesn’t work I suggest trying a different driver.</p>
