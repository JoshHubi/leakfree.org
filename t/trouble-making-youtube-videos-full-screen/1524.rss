    <title>trouble making Youtube videos full screen</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trouble-making-youtube-videos-full-screen/1524</link>
    <description>Ok, this summer I basically built myself a whole new computer. When I first built my computer I didn&#39;t have a new graphics card that would fit my motherboard so I went without one for a little while, and just used the integrated graphics on my mother board. It worked fine for everything except for gaming. However, when ever I tried make a youtube video full screen the browser (latest version of IE) would crash and I would get an error message that says 
[quote]
Instruction at &quot;0x07ef5830&quot; referenced memory at &quot;0x0ba00700&quot; the memory could not be &quot;written&quot;.
[/quote]
 
I have no idea what this means.
Since this happened, I have:
purchased a new graphics card, and two new sticks of compatible memory.

uninstalled and reinstalled IE,
uninstalled all of my adobe programs including Flash and reinstalled them.
uninstalled my video card drivers and reinstalled the latest ones.

This only happens on youtube oddly enough, and even stranger still it only affects videos in standard resolution or high quality resolution. If I load an HD video on youtube it will go full screen no problem. If I run it in Standard resolution instead of the HD, as long as it has the option of playing it in HD, it will go full screen and plays just fine. 

I am not sure what to do. I have ignored it for awhile and just watched the small window, but it is beginning to grow annoying and could use some help. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</description>

            <p>I suppose I can try it, but I would prefer to use only one browser and not have to switch between the two, and one of my class’s quizes have to be taken online and the program doesn’t support FireFox, infact it pretty much only supports IE.</p>

            <p>^ yep. I think when IE fails for any reason, switch to Firefox or similar. It has loads of extra features and apps that you never knew you needed. I have an app that makes me escreva em Português with a mouse click. Tenho muitas abelhas nas minhas calças.</p>
<p>Portuguese BTW for anyone who wants to translate</p>
