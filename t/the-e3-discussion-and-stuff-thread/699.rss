    <title>The E3: Discussion And Stuff thread.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-e3-discussion-and-stuff-thread/699</link>
    <description>Use this thread to talk about past/future E3 events and did you find them good?
Did you see what you were hoping to see?

Since EP3 didn&#39;t show and Valve are showing that L4D2 which i am starting to have doubts about.. Only a few games made me feel happy:

Crackdown 2
Split Second
And dome other stuff buy my mind is tired to name them now. :fffuuu:</description>
