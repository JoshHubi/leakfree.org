    <title>XNA games studio help</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xna-games-studio-help/2232</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to install and play custom games on my Zunhd using XNA games stuido 3.1 and following [url=&#39;https://zhdapps.com/news/?page_id=25#respond&#39;]this[/url]tutorial, but when I install it and go to XNA games studio in all programs there is no shortcut for the device center. I&#39;ve tried reinstalling and rebooting over and over and over and it still doesn&#39;t show up. I&#39;ve also tried searching the XNA folder and haven&#39;t found device center. I&#39;ve installed games on my old Zune using XNA 3.0 without any problems. 

Does anyone know what the problem might be?


EDIT: Sorry, problem resolved.</description>

<p>What was the issue?</p>

<p>For some reason xna wasn’t giving me a shortcut to the device center and it was in some out of the way folder that I didn’t find. And when I searched XNA I got way too many hits to sort through. I finally found it by searching my computer for device center.</p>
