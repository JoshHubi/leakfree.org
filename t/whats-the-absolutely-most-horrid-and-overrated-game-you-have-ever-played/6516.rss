</aside>
<p>Because I had to join in on the fun, that’s why.</p>
<p>Also another game that was absolutely evil to it’s core was Final Fantasy 11. They pull you in. Make you pay a monthly fee to play. The higher you level the farther you must travel (I spent more time traveling than I did anything else), the longer it takes to level and the mandatory having to find a party which, at times could take hours. Why? Whhhhyyyyyy!!! The economy in the game was terrible too! It was nearly impossible to earn money for new armor unless you were a high level and I heard people literally spent their total playtime of over a year to get maxed out on just one class. That’s over 8500 hours of sitting in your computer chair staring at a screen. And 5000 of those hours were most likely spent running around getting to your next monotonous objective… Leveling… Blah!</p>
<p>And worst of all, they came out with FFXIV    which is the same exact fucking thing. Someone tell me why please… :[</p>

            <p>MDK. I really didn’t see what people were so excited about. I’d rather play and try to beat the impossible Sonic Pin Ball or whatever it was called.</p>

            <p>Also, just gonna toss Bullet Storm in here. Go see my rant in the thread for it if you really need to know why. The TL;DR version is too linear, too repetitive, too tedious.</p>

<p>I actually rather liked GTA4. The story was simply put, amazing. Excellent writing, comparable to masterwork entries in the crime fiction genre like “Heat.” Considering many of the older GTA games were pastiches of crime films lacking in substance, GTA4 is a much more serious treatment of similar subject material. They keep their anarchistic sense of humor, but it never crowds out the strong narrative.</p>
<p>However, it irked me that there was no iron sights on the M4 rifle.</p>
<p>As for overrated and a game I hated, that honor goes to Halo 3 for completely failing on every promise the second game made. The narrative is wrapped up in brief and unsatisfying fashion, the game mechanics were newly nerfed from 2, the AI was still dumb as a brick through a window (And yes, I did play on Heroic and Legendary, the real difference is that shots do more damage, a la HL2), and on the whole the multiplayer was just not very fun. Forge isn’t flexible enough for mapping- they should have used a dedicated tool like Far Cry 2 (Another game I thought wasn’t all that great, but I spent quite a bit of time in the level editor).</p>

<p>So what about underrated games?</p>
<p>I could easily mention GTA IV wich, tough it got 10/10 from IGN, seems to be pretty hated by fans nowadays. In my oppinion its FAAAAAAAAR supperior to San Andreas. The map is about 3/4 as big yet its so detailed, it feels alot smaller than it actually is. Some people say its boring because all you do is go bowling and stuff… YEAH!!! That reminds me of San Andreas, where all you did was gambling…</p>
<p>People seem to forget how groundbreaking the gameplay is. Most of the interactions you have with the environnement are physic based, wich makes every moment unique and one hell of alot more satisfying than any other GTA. And the level of details in the environnement and sound desing is just astronomical, a real masterpiece! Its really JUST AS GOOD Half Life 2 in therm of overall desing (if not better) , regardless of the fact that GTA IV is set in a huge-ass city in wich you free to travel in and that HL2 is a linear corridor shooter(without getting too much into details).</p>
<p>In my oppinion GTA IV could easily be the best game of all time because. I mean, even if you couldn’t travel freely trough the city… The story, the art desing and the gameplay themself would be enough to make it the best game of all time…</p>
