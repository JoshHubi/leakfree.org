    <description>Hello again Black Mesa,

I return with yet another suggestion to make for the mod while it&#39;s still in development.

Although the developers have not released any updates on this site, it is still fortunate that there are updates produced independently by the developers on other sites, such as this video [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSe1NUsvZBY]here.[/url] I don&#39;t know how old this video is, but after seeing this video, I feel that it is in my best interest to offer the idea of changing the firing mechanism of the tank.

For one, a tank shell travels REALLY fast: about at least over 4000 fps. I done the calculations with Source units, and the shell would have to be traveling well over 78,000 game units in Source. Frankly that&#39;s just too much for the source engine to handle. That&#39;s why source made the func_tankmortar entity that gets the vector of the entity, and creates an explosion at the vector end position. I suggest that the tank&#39;s firing mechanism should follow the same principle, with graphical modifications of course.

Secondly, the explosion magnitude of the resulting shell explosion seems way too small as well. For a heavy battle tank, I&#39;d imagine the explosion size would be much greater, unless if a larger explosion size would hinder engine performance, or it&#39;s supposed to be utilizing a different shell of some sort. Either way, I do feel that to show the true power of the M1, it&#39;s explosion size should be increased; especially since to the best of my knowledge, the player is only going to fight it once.

I don&#39;t have any complaints about how strong the tank is, has you have already stated on the wiki, but I&#39;m not under the impression that the adjustments I have stated above will hinder gameplay in any way, so hopefully these ideas will see their way though.</description>

<p>You can blame my intent on indenting for that issue. I’m only asking because that’s how it was done in HL1: The point of the shells travelling that fast is that you weren’t supposed to be out in the open where the tank would blow your ass to kingdom come. You were supposed to sneak your way around the trenches and eventually get behind it.</p>
<p>They don’t need to lower the muzzle velocity if it means better gameplay, but at least increase the size of the explosion.</p>

<p>I understand your concerns and while your are right about it being not big enough, an overpowered explosion wouldn’t match with the damage dealt to Gordon. Gameplay always &gt; realistic specs</p>

            <p>While your calculations are spot on, I’m afraid that your concerns fall into the realm of what is determined an acceptable break from reality. Yes, M1 shells travel fast, and they cover a wide area of effect, but at the same time, a real Abrams would take much more time and firepower than would be deemed enjoyable. The role the M1 serves in gameplay is to provide a high-pressure, foreboding opponent while giving the player enough freedom of movement and retaliation to feel empowered against the threat. Having a “click, bang, boom” speed to the cannon shells would be out of nowhere and not at all fun. Please trust that the devs have whittled their way down into creating a man versus tank experience that is entertaining enough to where its deviations from reality are overshadowed by the sheer “cool” factor of the gameplay.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Making it more real doesn’t make it more fun, and after (about) seven years of development, I’d say the devs have the right idea of what is “too much” in that department.</p>
