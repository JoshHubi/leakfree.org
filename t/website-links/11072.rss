    <description>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just my computer, but in the link banner at the top of the site, the MEDIA, TEAM, and INFORMATION buttons all send me to an error page &quot;The page you are looking for cannot be found&quot;. It has been this way since the first time I came here on launch day.

edit: Found out that the links work if you are on the homepage, but trying to click on them from here in the forums, they don&#39;t work.</description>
