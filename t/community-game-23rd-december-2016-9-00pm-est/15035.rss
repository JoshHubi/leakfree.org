    <title>Community Game - 23rd December 2016 - 9:00PM EST</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/community-game-23rd-december-2016-9-00pm-est/15035</link>
    <description>This is just a quick heads up to let everyone know that the dev team are going to be holding an impromptu little game of community deathmatch in Black Mesa on Friday! Feel free to hop in and join us, if you fancy chatting with and maybe even killing a few devs! It will be nothing formal and serious, just a fun little community game to celebrate the recent Xen screenshot, and the end to a pretty crazy year! Expect a few devs, maybe a few friends of ours, and hopefully a bunch of you lovely lot!

The game is currently scheduled for:

[b]Friday 23/12/16 (23rd December) - 9:00PM EST[/b]

All you have to do to play with us, is to just fire up Black Mesa this time and come find which server we&#39;re on. Shouldn&#39;t be too hard at all! As we move into the New Year, we hope to start doing these community games more regularly again, as well as firing up some live streams again, where we can talk more about the development of Black Mesa, its future, and all that fun stuff.

For those of you who can&#39;t make it, as we&#39;re sure many of you won&#39;t be able to, we wish you all very happy holidays. Fret not; this will happen again in the future too!</description>

            <p>I do believe that, as a matter of principle, all BM fans should jump in and help shoot the Chon.  Weren’t we going to make a new game mode called Chon Hunt? It can be a game mode that is more of a community policy than set up on a server…</p>
