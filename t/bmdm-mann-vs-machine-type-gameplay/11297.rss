    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bmdm-mann-vs-machine-type-gameplay/11297</link>
    <description>In BMDM, I think that it would be a great idea to have some sort of game mode based on TF2&#39;s &quot;Mann vs. Machine&quot; mode, where a team of players fights against waves of HECU/Aliens.  Possibly, like in MVM, the players could get &quot;money&quot; with each kill which lets them buy powerups (possibly health packs and ammo?).  The objective would be to either to survive all waves and/or prevent the HECU from reaching an objective (maybe killing scientists that you are protecting).

Thoughts?</description>

            <p>Hey guys, back!  I am not done with the map yet, but I just want to let everyone know that I am still working on it.  I am focusing more on the design of the map, focusing on things such as the location of first contact, layout, etc.  It is taking time, but progress is steadily moving forward!</p>

            <p>As Parnifia tried to say in his awfully rude post before, It’s an idea for a community project. And if people is ready to develop and play it, why not ?</p>

<p>why not just play TL2 or Counter strike?</p>
<p>I don’t see any reason why the developers should waste their time with this. Especially when they aren’t getting paid</p>

<p>I did this a couple of weeks ago. SP only of course.</p>
<p>Entirely randomised waves and music</p>
<p>Evidently the map itself is a subpar layout, but I was more focussing on the I/O. Planning to make a QE themed map for it.</p>

            <p>Whoops, some of the cell doors in shot 2 are visible in the editor but not in-game. I’ll have to backport some of the changes I make to my mod later. (Being careful to use HL2 textures so there aren’t any broken parts when I add it back in later)</p>
<p>So yeah, WIP.</p>

<p>Action shots. I threw a lot of NPCs at the map, so the framerate can get very stutter-happy, particularly at the start. This will be fixed in further iterations. At any rate, it’s a good stress test for the map.</p>

<p>Enemies on the map:</p>
<p>Headcrabs<br>
Zombies (Scientist/Security Guard)<br>
Vortigaunts<br>
HECU (Commander, Grenadier, Grunt, Medic)<br>
Bullsquid<br>
Alien Grunts<br>
Assassins (These are my favorite- the map has three stories so the assassins can flip and leap between all three tiers harassing the player. Highly unpredictable)</p>

            <p>Better idea: Have the tank strapped to the top of an osprey that flies around the outside of the map, and when you kill it, it simply crashes somewhere outside the map.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Is the tank corpse a ragdoll? Perhaps you could parent an explosion to it that throws the entire tank corpse out of the map, and then fade it out. It’s over the top, but it’s an idea.</p>
<p>Or just make the tank part of the final wave.</p>

            <p>Ideally you’d make it so that, when destroyed, it only explodes into a whole bunch of gibs, which then eventually fade out. But I’m not sure that that’s even possible with only map stuff.</p>
<p>Maybe have the tank stay in one place, then when it gets blown up, instantly kill the tank remains and then activate a separate entity which makes a whole bunch of flaming metal gibs.</p>

<p>Have it drive along an area on the outside of the map, and when it gets destroyed, a grate below it collapses or something.</p>
<p>Edit: I do technically know how to map (to some extent) and I’d love to create a map for this type of gamemode, but I don’t really have the time, unfortunately. That said, it would be great to have a template map with the I/O all set up, so that you only have to add in geometry and move the spawnpoints and such.</p>

<p>You could trigger a kill / destroy for the tank on death, although that would look like it went poof!..</p>

            <p>This is like survival mode which would be good as a sort of team based co-op similar to zombie horde</p>
<p>so far as  free for all deathmatch… Playing as a vortigant might be good claw melee and<br>
zap attack</p>
<p>Scientists that can stab a syringe as a melee attack</p>
<p>Marines have a knife melee similar to counterstrike</p>
<p>Security guards have nightstick or a wrench as a melee attack</p>
<p>Playing as other non humanoid aliens I am not so sure about.</p>
<p>Could be quite interesting almost class based different characters have different attributes strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Would not mind seeing a gun game mode too</p>

            <p>I plan to have it check around the level for explosives and occasionally spawn an Abrams or Osprey or w/e. Not that hard to do. The issues with the Abrams is that they leave behind a giant prop Have to find a way of neatly disposing them without it looking weird. Also I never even used the assault stuff. Probably a good idea to. I just put a path ent near the center of the map and made all the NPCs path to it on spawn.</p>

            <p>I’d like to see some waves with vehicles, too. Like having a two Osprey wave.</p>
<p>Also, are you having any issues with ai_goal_assault? The “BeginAssault” input seems to be missing from the BM config…</p>
<p>OH MAN, my last playthrough of the map gave me an Icky wave. God, you’re a genius. I took the liberty of decompiling the map to take a look at how you got all that to work. That’s some <span class="bbcode-i">crazy</span> entity work.</p>

            <p>Way ahead of you, it’ll scale fine for bigger maps and turrets are easily doable. It also already includes a wave counter. But it stops at 16 because of an I/O error.</p>

            <p>I ported in a map from my Half-Life 2 mod to the Black Mesa configuration and started tossing enemies at it. It’s quite fun- they in-fight and my framerate goes to complete shit when the level first loads. I’ll probably have to expand it a bit- there’s three floors and a lot of interconnections, but the surface area itself is rather small.</p>
<p>EDIT: Tried Trigger’s map. Of all the things that kill me, it’s the Houndeye wave. I got like nine in, I think.</p>
<p>That’s a good start on the logic for waves. I’d try to add a wave count, so players can show off how many rounds they survived via screencap. Once the logic for all the wave stuff is proofed, we can try putting it on bigger maps. Perhaps add turrets the player can place, like the defense sequences in Entanglement?</p>

            <p>It took me a lot of time to figure how to use that file of yours, Trigger_Proximity, but I’ve done it and tried it out just now.</p>
<p>It looks like a training program of some sort (the design, I mean), but I guess it’s not important.</p>
<p>It was entertaining - I’ve made through 5 waves, then H.E.C.U army got us all down in two seconds <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I would give it a run, but I currently don’t have access to my laptop, and am “working” on a Mac. :’( Ah, well…<br>
So I need to wait until… Oh, probably a week or so, and by that time playing it may have become moot. FML, ya know.</p>

            <p>I personally have no plans to play Deathmatch. However, if this was released, I would be playing it constantly. I love survival type games, and I always thought Half-Life needed a survival mode.</p>

<p>Cool!  I am going to get started on a prototype and report back soon (we should probably start out without multiplayer for now, for simplicity’s sake).  You can also work on it and show your approach, and we can see which one works best.</p>
