    <description>Just finished [b][COLOR=&#39;orange&#39;]Black Mesa[/b]...and wow. [i]Team[/i], you did a [b]fantastic[/b] job. I really did expect great things after seeing the media over the years, but the final product blew my expectations away even further! :retard:

[minor spoilers ahead][/SIZE]

-

I&#39;ll start by saying I&#39;m a HL series veteran, having beat all games and expansions multiple times over the years. ^_^

The atmosphere throughout the game is perfect. I actually felt genuinely creeped out all the way through [i][COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]Unforseen Consequences[/i]. The first time I saw and heard the zombie screaming on fire made my skin crawl. Good stuff! Despite knowing almost exactly what was coming, it felt like I was experiencing the resonance cascade for the very first time again.

The attention to detail in all the maps was very nice; I didn&#39;t expect that many unique props, let alone some of the well-thought out expansions to certain areas. When the laser tore through the wall in [i][COLOR=&#39;orange&#39;]Questionable Ethics[/i] I stood there for ages in awe of the gorgeous melted concrete design you guys created.

The voice acting was also spot on, despite being intentionally cheesy! It was hilarious hearing the soldiers, all sounding like Snake / David Hayter. Kudos to the actors. :jizz:

I could go on; it was pretty much everything I&#39;d hoped for, and I commend you all for sticking with it for all these years and creating such a professional masterpiece.

-

My minor quibbles:

1 - The crowbar viewmodel and attack animations seem too weak and flimsy compared to the HL1 / HL2 ones.

2 - The HECU Soldiers do a bit [i]too[/i] much damage in my opinion; I had to quick-save like a mofo when confronting them on Hard.

3 - It&#39;s a shame you couldn&#39;t find a more suitable voice actor for Eli. [i]Debeerguy[/i] was a little jarring compared to the brilliant Kleiner voice!  :wink:

Amazing work.  :smiley:</description>

            <p>I also agree with the crowbar animations being sort of pitiful. But after a while I didn’t even notice. Also, I agree with Eli’s voice actor being weak compared to the rest of the cast. I don’t have any other complaints though.</p>

            <p>I agree that the crowbar animations were a bit odd and that grunts seemed a bit too smart sometimes. Plenty of animation were really awesome though, like when you pick up the hivehand and Gordon holds out his hand for a bit as if to say “Am I really gonna stick my arm in there?”</p>

<p>I don’t see how you could have a problem with the crowbar viewmodel since it’s the one from HL2.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, the crowbar itself was the same model, but the ‘holding animation’ and other animations weren’t very realistic or powerful. He seems to jab with it like a sword, rather than swing it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>i think Eli was allright.</p>
<p>what i noticed is that some of the sound volumes were unbalanced, but this is probably a bug with my system. gun sounds were too loud, so i couldnt hear the sound effects  that well.</p>

            <p>I second what you say from the OP…</p>
<p>But at the end of the day WOW!</p>
<p>Gabe Newell must have shed a tear…</p>
<p>It’s an outstanding piece of work… I am a bit stuck on we got hostiles at the momment so I am sure I have a lot of great stuff to come.</p>
<p>I am trying to run it on my desktop PC which seems to be struggling with it a bit I think I need to put more RAM inside because It is stuttering. and It is upsetting my experience so I might start from the begining and put it on my laptop instead which has better capability.</p>
<p>I hate to critic something as good as Black Mesa… But the only thing that I was a bit upset not to see so far was The Zombie is gone that broke out of the door in the office complex which was something that I really liked but to be honest so far I am blown away by the attention to detail and how they have expanded it aswell as enhanced it.</p>
<p>I love the scary parts or perhaps I just missed that bit with the zombie breaking out the door?</p>
<p>The zombie breaking out the box is also gone at the start of the canal but I understand that did not make sense and I am fine with that to be honest good call.</p>
<p>The Marines are really difficult to kill… That is why I am stuck at the moment I have to face about 8 of them and I have no magnum rounds left but full health and having to use the MP5 and I keep getting killed by them. I manage to get about 4 of them before dying as they deal loads of damage from afar</p>
<p>I have so many thoughts on it there is too much to say all in 1 post but This is magnificent MOD and an exemplary piece of work Well done BLACK MESA TEAM!!!</p>
<p>Dreams can come true</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ditto.  Crowbar was on point.</p>
<p>The only gun I dislike the viewmodel for is the glock.  It’s awkward, like the hand position is off, and it feels too big, I don’t know – I also think the sound for the glock it to painfully loud.</p>
<p>Other than that I thought the game was stellar, better than the original.  The gluon gun is super pretty.</p>
<p>As for Eli’s voice…  It’s his accent, it’s totally different – but the way I see it, it’s like movie sequels when they have different actors playing the same people, not a deal breaker by any means.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I didn’t really notice too much wrong with the crowbar. I thought it was alright.</p>

<h2>1 - The crowbar viewmodel and attack animations seem too weak and flimsy compared to the HL1 / HL2 ones.<br>
[color=Red]Definitely agree. I love how there’s more screen kick though.<br>
2 - The HECU Soldiers do a bit <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> much damage in my opinion; I had to quick-save like a mofo when confronting them on Hard.<br>
[color=Red]Sort of agree. I had to tone down my difficulty to easy (from normal) in most battles, like the Questionable Ethics one, and the We’ve got hostiles one.<br>
3 - It’s a shame you couldn’t find a more suitable voice actor for Eli. <span class="bbcode-i">Debeerguy</span> was a little jarring compared to the brilliant Kleiner voice!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[color=Red]In some way, I think his voice is right. It was 20 years before the original events from Half-Life 2, so it could of been obvious that his voice has changed since then. His voice could of used that accent Eli had in HL2.</h2>
<h2><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr</span></h2>
<p>Amazing work.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just finished <span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘orange’]Black Mesa</span>…and wow. <span class="bbcode-i">Team</span>, you did a <span class="bbcode-b">fantastic</span> job. I really did expect great things after seeing the media over the years, but the final product blew my expectations away even further! :retard:</p>
<p>[minor spoilers ahead][/SIZE]</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li></ul>
<p>I’ll start by saying I’m a HL series veteran, having beat all games and expansions multiple times over the years. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The atmosphere throughout the game is perfect. I actually felt genuinely creeped out all the way through <span class="bbcode-i">[COLOR=‘Orange’]Unforseen Consequences</span>. The first time I saw and heard the zombie screaming on fire made my skin crawl. Good stuff! Despite knowing almost exactly what was coming, it felt like I was experiencing the resonance cascade for the very first time again.</p>
<p>The attention to detail in all the maps was very nice; I didn’t expect that many unique props, let alone some of the well-thought out expansions to certain areas. When the laser tore through the wall in <span class="bbcode-i">[COLOR=‘orange’]Questionable Ethics</span> I stood there for ages in awe of the gorgeous melted concrete design you guys created.</p>
<p>The voice acting was also spot on, despite being intentionally cheesy! It was hilarious hearing the soldiers, all sounding like Snake / David Hayter. Kudos to the actors. :jizz:</p>
<p>I could go on; it was pretty much everything I’d hoped for, and I commend you all for sticking with it for all these years and creating such a professional masterpiece.</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li></ul>
<p>My minor quibbles:</p>
<p>1 - The crowbar viewmodel and attack animations seem too weak and flimsy compared to the HL1 / HL2 ones.</p>
<p>2 - The HECU Soldiers do a bit <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> much damage in my opinion; I had to quick-save like a mofo when confronting them on Hard.</p>
<p>3 - It’s a shame you couldn’t find a more suitable voice actor for Eli. <span class="bbcode-i">Debeerguy</span> was a little jarring compared to the brilliant Kleiner voice!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
