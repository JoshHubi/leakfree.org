    <description>[b]Black Mesa: Uplink[/b][/SIZE]

[b]Overview[/b]
I&#39;m recreating the Half-Life demo (HL: Uplink) released by Valve in early 1999. The demo featured content that was scrapped from the original storyline. Some might consider it canon with the story, others don&#39;t. What matters though, is that many people enjoyed this short episode and that&#39;s the reason why I am remaking Uplink for Black Mesa.

I&#39;ve been making Half-Life maps since 1999, mostly for Sven Co-op (HL1), Team Fortress Classic (HL1) and Resistance and Liberation (HL2). I released my own MOD Land of Legends (HL1) in 2009. My own project An Open Window (HL2) was discontinued after a long break from mapping. After playing Black Mesa, the mapping virus got me again and I wanted to create something people can enjoy and I enjoy making.


[b]The project[/b]
I&#39;m the only person working on this project in my free time, doing mapping, models and textures. I&#39;m working in chronologic order, creating the remake while playing through the original to stay as close to it as possible. However, I&#39;m updating areas to todays visual possibilities and change gameplay accordingly, adjusting it to the new environments. Black Mesa: Uplink will not be integrated into the original storyline or extended. 

[b]Charity[/b]
I have decided to dedicate this project to a charity. Every year, the Dutch national radio station [url=&#39;https://seriousrequest.3fm.nl/&#39;]3FM[/url] is collecting money for the International Red Cross. 3 DJ&#39;s from this radio station lock themselves up in a glass house without food between the 18th and 24th of December. During this week they host a radioshow 24 hours a day, showcasing the many initiatives to collect money for young children in third world countries.  

So if you enjoy the work I&#39;m putting into this MOD and you have a little to spare, please think about donating for a good cause. Since their website only accepts Dutch bank accounts, I&#39;ve set up my Paypal account to accept [url=&#39;https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=hezussupastar@hotmail.com&amp;lc=GB&amp;item_name=Serious%20Request&amp;item_number=BMUplink%C2%A4cy_code=EUR&amp;bn=PP-DonationsBFbtn_donateCC_LG.gifNonHosted&#39;]donations[/url]. In return, I will do my best to get this MOD done by the 18th of December, so it gets full exposure during the fundraiser week. Whatever sum has been donated before the 24th will then directly go towards the 3FM Serious Request event. I really hope I can use this hobby of mine to change some lives out there. Thank you!

            <p>My 2 cents on the mod:</p>
<p>Very well done, except…</p>
<p>Being able to open the door of the hangar after breaking out through the vent, and letting Barney continue to follow you, kind of breaks the next scene for me since Barney’s extra firepower really nerfs the challenge of the troops. Old Barn should be stuck in that hangar until you get back, if you lead him into it. Maybe having that switch be broken, and a stray Vort bolt from the fight opens the hangar door?</p>
<p>Also, I miss the challenge of trying to take out the machine gun nest with grenades from above, without getting killed, and then using that same gun on advancing squads from the next area. That was one of the fun parts of the original demo, and without it the whole thing was a bit flat.</p>
<p>Should have been a blowtorch animation on the main door of the antenna room, after you set the antenna and are fighting those troops, which I didn’t see. The door was open later though, I noted. (I went back to get Barney, who was still alive next to the torched-open door.)</p>
<p>More debris falling in the beginning would have been nice, like in the original…</p>

            <p>I like black mesa uplink. I think it would be good if the outdoor area were larger. In half life uplink I liked that outdoor area with the large containers and the ability to run around on top of them. I think it would be nice for that area to be larger with lots of enemies (marines, aliens).</p>

            <p>I spelled it with a dash because of the spell check, alright? But that initial portal in <span class="bbcode-i">Lambda Core</span> is the 1 I’m talking about, not the portal to Xen. Plus, the “nightmare” theory provides a convenient explanation as to why <span class="bbcode-i">Uplink</span> is set during dusk while <span class="bbcode-i">Forget About Freeman</span>/<span class="bbcode-i">Lambda Core</span> are set during the daytime.</p>

            <p>What portal, the portal to Xen? It wouldn’t make sense because the Uplink chapter (not Up-link) is about ganing entry to Lambda Complex but in Lambda Core, you are already inside it. Uplink happened between FaF and LC but cut by Valve.</p>

            <p>I understand you said you have no plans to do so, but could you please make an “addon” version of <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa: Up-link</span>? The way I see it, when Gordon entered the portal leading into <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa: Up-link Add-on</span>, he was knocked unconscious. <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa: Up-link</span> was a nightmare that Gordon was having during that state of unconsciousness while floating through the void connecting the portals. When he went through the portal leading out of <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa: Up-link Add-on</span>, his nightmare ended &amp; he regained consciousness.</p>

            <p>My suggestions for update:<br>
-Better animations for vent and soda machine.<br>
-Xeno flora somewhere<br>
-Change of lighting to dark after garg kills guard and more scentist corpses there<br>
-lighting fixes<br>
-you can pass through the sewers even marines don’t open the door<br>
-change from WGH soundtrack to FaF soundtrack.<br>
-more zombies in ambush or more houndeyes in that area since BM has larger packs of houndeyes<br>
-make the lighting even more red at the start of level also a bit of cinematic physics<br>
-a camera that shows a scientist when he says “Wait a minute, and I’ll let you in.” that scientist is the same as the one at the start of the level.<br>
-elevator changing levels not too long and change the elevator too<br>
-vent on the warehouse must have like a ladder to distract players</p>
<p>I guess it’s okay to put my suggestions. It’s not a total overhaul like expanding areas even more.</p>

<p>Yeh, thanks, I read this in the readme. It’s a tiny bit more complicated then that.<br>
Anyway, I did that and if anybody wants here is the scenes.image file which is compatible with both uplink and surface tension mod:<br>

            <p>There is still going to be an update to adapt the pack to the new settings after the Xen release. I’ll also do some smaller bug fixes that have been reported, but don’t expect a complete overhaul or extension.</p>

            <p>Fiddled around a bit and removed it manually. I have nothing against the mod, I just didn’t enjoy it enough to bother playing it more than once or twice.</p>

            <p>I repeat:<br>
changed the uplink chapter from zero to sixteen.<br>
BMS Main Story has NPC Problem with first guard who opens the train!<br>
The guard disappears when he starts to and you stuck in the train!</p>
<p>And i think it is better for everything!<br>
Not for future updated files…<br>
It gives a special status to the rest of the game</p>
<p>1st: Hazard Course Remake<br>
2nd: BMS Main Game +Xen part<br>
3rd: Credits: FAKE<br>
(a small part of original to create a transition to demo remake)<br>
4th: Uplink<br>
5th: The Real Credits</p>
<p>And the title font on main game start (Black Mesa Uplink)<br>
has missing characters (U, p, i, n)<br>
They aren’t included in the blackmesa.ttf file!</p>
