    <title>Programmers! - Which Scripting Language Should I Learn?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/programmers-which-scripting-language-should-i-learn/11533</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been slowly learning C++ for a while now.  But I would like to pick up a scripting language such as C# or Lua as well since most modern game engines usually limit you to using object oriented languages.  I&#39;ve heard C# might be a bit easier to learn since its syntax is similar to C++.  But I&#39;ve also heard some good things about Lua.  Which one would you guys recommend?</description>

            <p>Javascript is such a pain sometimes. I never liked it. At least now most browsers have js debug features… So I guess I might try getting back into it again sometime.</p>

            <p>You could always learn some good ol’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">LOLCODE</a>. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><code>HAI
CAN HAS STDIO?
I HAS A VAR
IM IN YR LOOP
	UP VAR!!1
	VISIBLE VAR
	IZ VAR BIGGER THAN 10? KTHXBYE
IM OUTTA YR LOOP
KTHXBYE</code><code>HAI
CAN HAS STDIO?
PLZ OPEN FILE "LOLCATS.TXT"?
	AWSUM THX
		VISIBLE FILE
	O NOES
		INVISIBLE "ERROR!"
KTHXBYE</code></p>
<p>In all seriousness - what you need to learn are the basics of programming.  Like, what’s a variable, what’s a condition, what does “((true XOR false) OR false) AND true” evaluate to…  Once you master the basics, you need to figure out what kind of a program you want to make, and then pick a language that is best suited for that purpose.  When I need something very stable without a GUI for Linux, I pick C or C++.  When I need to mock up a quick Windows GUI program, I go with Visual Basic.  When I need to develop a web application, PHP is my friend…  et cetera.</p>

            <p>Lua tends to be used all over the place. Honestly though, it wouldn’t hurt to learn both.</p>
<p>And although Python is most definitely not used for games and stuff like that, I really like it.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Really, syntax differences should not be an enormous factor when trying to learn a new language, IMO. Anyone who can code should be able to get the syntax right if the language is decently-documented with good reference material to work with. That’s my philosophy when picking up new languages. What you should be looking at is usefulness. Pick a project you want to work on, and choose one language that is specifically good for that project. If anything stands out, great. If not, then you can use other factors to decide.</p>
