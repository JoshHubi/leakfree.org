    <title>Bioshock 2 Release Date moved back to 26 March 2010</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bioshock-2-release-date-moved-back-to-26-march-2010/977</link>
    <description>If like me you loved the first game and have either pre-ordered or are thinking of buying Bioshock 2, you&#39;ll be slightly disappointed to know that the previous release date of October 2009 has now been moved back to March next year. 

So, what are your thoughts on this? Would you rather 2K Games take longer on the game?</description>

            <p>I know - the original geek reply to a missed verb is “This sentence no verb.” so the above is a play-on-quote.  Though you are correct that level’s one is missing a verb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you ever play “Clock Tower”? It’s a point and click adventure game, quite similar to Monkey Island or Sam &amp; Max; but horror-oriented and overall awesome. In one game there was a particular villain by the name of “Scissorman”, more or less a gaunt, listless man dragging around a giant pair of scissors with the intent of ending you.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good.</p>
<p>Why I bring this up is because in Clock Tower, as you navigating the expansive and otherwise confusing map, there was always - ALWAYS - a chance that at some point Scissor man would show up to ruin your day. It wasn’t scripted, it wasn’t activated by grabbing an item, it was totally randomly generated and it scared the living piss out of me every time!</p>
<p>That’s what I’m looking for in Bioshock 2, because from what I’ve been told via e-mail - it’s much in that same spirit. Big Sister can show up anywhere, at any time, and make your day a living hell. Even someplace you cleared out decades ago, a safe haven for hours, could suddenly become your last stand against Andrew Ryan’s failsafe. Whether it’s much of the same or not, the story continues; and the experience is bound to be…amazing.</p>

            <p>Exactly  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Granted there’s familiar elements but then at least some are required if people who played the first game will be able to relate when it comes to the sequel. I’ve read review upon review as well as looking at gameplay footage and from what I can see, they’re really trying to improve and add on all the parts of the first game that were good in the first place.</p>
<p>The thing that really excites me is the whole concept of going out in the ocean.<br>
The point is that it’s not for combat, so no you won’t get to fight the giant whale from the first game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  What it does is allow you to take a breather and really think about where you are, admire the world around you and even take a look through the windows at the next area to spot any possible threats.</p>
<p>As far as story is concerned, it’s quite possible that the Big Daddy you play as, the first Big Daddy ever created, may have been protector to the Big Sister.  Despite the fact that she stalks you, impales you and generally makes your life hell, there could be some relationship between the two that you find out about during the course of the game. It also seems as though Big Sister may be being controlled by someone else, possibly Orrin Oscar Lutwidge, for those who know who he is. Tennenbaum also has a part to play; having left the city previously in Bioshock she has returned for some unknown reason. Either way, I’m sure any new characters that are brought into the plot line will be of the same quality and detail as those in the first game.</p>

In one game there was a particular villain by the name of “Scissorman”, more or less a gaunt, listless man dragging around a giant pair of scissors with the intent of ending you.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good.</p>
<p>Why I bring this up is because in Clock Tower, as you navigating the expansive and otherwise confusing map, there was always - ALWAYS - a chance that at some point Scissor man would show up to ruin your day. It wasn’t scripted, it wasn’t activated by grabbing an item, it was totally randomly generated and it scared the living piss out of me every time!</p>
<p>That’s what I’m looking for in Bioshock 2, because from what I’ve been told via e-mail - it’s much in that same spirit. Big Sister can show up anywhere, at any time, and make your day a living hell. Even someplace you cleared out decades ago, a safe haven for hours, could suddenly become your last stand against Andrew Ryan’s failsafe. Whether it’s much of the same or not, the story continues; and the experience is bound to be…amazing.</p>

<p>Yes I know, I have the leak (beta and wc mappack) myself. So yeah, they did more than just polish the game  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Me personally, I think it’ll pay off. I mean I pre-ordered it so obviously I’m annoyed that I have to wait longer to get it, but if it means the game will be better quality wise then I can wait. If you haven’t already I’d reccomend looking at gameplay footage because this game is ALOT better than the first. Not only does it look better, but they’re adding a whole load of new concepts in, which should spice it up. Plus this site <a href="https://www.somethinginthesea.com/home.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.somethinginthesea.com/home.html</a> is great because it’s like a side story that ties in with BS2. Worth looking at it.</p>

            <p>They’ve just hired Arkane Studios to make the levels more creepy so this doesn’t surprise me. There are 4 studios working on it now, so I guess it’s an important title for 2k.</p>
