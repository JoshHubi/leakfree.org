    <title>I am lucky...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-am-lucky/8419</link>
    <description>as a noob gamer at the young age of 15 or something, my parents decided to buy a new PC &quot;for business&quot;.  so I went online and read reviews of games, trying to decide what to spend my limited funds on (aside from Madden of course)  
I finally decided to buy System Shock 2, and later, Half Life.  and ever since, nothing else has measured up.  Most of the time I get pissed that new games aren&#39;t as good, but I&#39;m finally coming to the realization  that I am actually one of the lucky few who got to experience gaming at it&#39;s best at the very beginning, and the continuing failures of the gaming industry can never take that away from me.  

I gamed in the times of System Shock 2 and Half-Life...</description>

            <p>As Fnork says, time is a filter.<br>
I would argue that most of these claims come out of pure nostalgia - we were much younger and far less cynical.</p>
<p>I remember a ton of really shitty games from the 90s.<br>
And I also remember a ton of really great games from the 00s.</p>
<p>I’ve spent hundreds of hours playing Xbox 360.</p>
<p>But yeah, games these days do seem to take you more by the hand than they used to. “Cinematic experience” and all that.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>And with the internet you get access to information about all games, the good and the bad. Back in the mid nineties you weren’t necessarily able to get information about every single game in existence and only really knew about games that your friends and/or gaming magazines recommended you which those games would have been at least decent. So it’s not that games have gotten worse, it’s that you’re now able to know about all the terrible games that come out every year.</p>

<p>There’s a very big difference with that. Just because you don’t like Skyrim doesn’t make it a bad game, it means you don’t like it (I’m inclined to agree about the redundancy of the game too). Vice Versa, you can enjoy a piece of complete shit. It might have poorly designed levels, flat gunplay and lack a decent story but somehow you may still enjoy it anyway. <span class="bbcode-i">That doesn’t make it a good game</span>, it just means you enjoyed it and there might have been a little fun to be had with the game.</p>
<p>Look at tresspasser, that failed Jurassic Park game. The AI was broken, the shooting mechanics were awkward, and the game was near unplayable. There were still fun things to do in the game with the physics (which is pretty impressive considering it was the 90s) and screwing with the bad AI, but it was very much a bad game .</p>
<p>Shitty looking environments and broken features, with badly tiled textures and enemies that don’t react to anything are not an expression of someone’s opinion, they are facts about the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Exactly – when I said Skyrim was bad I was mimicking the others as a way of showing an example of how opinion based a game’s rating is. I wasn’t objectively labeling it. I’m sure you understand.</p>

<p>By your logic it would seem that there are no good or bad games.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There technically isn’t. There are only games that you consider good and bad, and there are those who agree with you.</p>
<p>While it’s true that the majority of the world can agree on something, it’s still roughly subjective. People usually agree with things because it appeals to their basic biological impulses.</p>
<p>For instance, if a game manages to tap into someone’s instinct by scaring the fuck of them, then many people may agree that the game is scary and rocks as a horror game. Reason being that all of our instincts are designed the same way – but of course there is social and psychological molding that changes the way we perceive things; that’s why someone is always bound to disagree with you.</p>

            <p>Yeah, well I remember when we played with sticks and rocks!</p>
<p>Seriously though, the general quallity of games haven’t decreased, it’s just that as games are regularly pushed out, both good ones and bad ones, constantly in our faces with media reports, you notice all the shit because it gets attention.</p>
<p>Games only seem to have been better back in the day in hindsight. Games like Half-Life are the ones that people still play and talk about. No one gives a shit about the bad ones, and therefore they’re forgotten with time.</p>
<p>It’s the same thing with all media, really, films, music, you name it. People remember what’s good and completelly shut out the bad things, thereby making it seem as though they never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>In a few years, it’s possible that no one will remember all the shitty Call of Duty sequels, but people might still talk highly about Skyrim.</p>
<p>They only thing that’s really changed is that developers have become a bit more greedy with their distribution policies, as well as trends, different things are popular at different times.</p>

            <p>masterpiece. a game with unlimited replay value. going to be hard pushed to find somebody who didn’t enjoy that game even after the 3rd time. although strictly speaking not PC title, it did get emulated (cop out i know).</p>

            <p>Maybe they <span class="bbcode-i">don’t want a life</span></p>
<p>Seriously though, just because there are bad games now doesn’t mean there aren’t good games. You seem to forget how many games in the 90s were terrible. It’s the same as it always was, there are far more bad games then good.</p>
<p>Difference now is, there’s a lot more good AAA titles, and even indy games and mods then there was back then.</p>
<p>Although I will admit there was something cozy about not having easy access to the internet and just playing what I had in single player or coop without being able to look things up on a whim.</p>
<p>And also if you wanted to have friends to play games with (at least for me since I had dial up) you had to make them in real life first xD</p>
<p>Maybe because I was younger so I was more happy with what I got, whereas now I’m much more technical. Something I do miss is how when I was younger I would look at a game that looked like shit, and simply see it as another place. I didn’t think about textures and lighting and shit like that, I just played the game and it seemed as real to me as anything else. That was the best part.</p>
<p>But again, that’s because I was younger, not because gaming was better.</p>

            <p>I find it funny how you guys talk about how 90’s games where so great and today’s suck but you only talk about 3-4 of how many games came out in the 90’s?</p>
<p>Get a fucking life and stop sitting on a forum spewing nostalgia while you are young and shouldn’t be wasting all your time sitting around moping about how the “good ol’ days” where.</p>

<p>Anyone else get all depressed when they remember those days when you could flip on the PC and play some Half Life or Baldur’s Gate; remember when you could invite a friend over and help each other get past puzzles in Resident Evil 2 while eating some pop-tarts at 8:00 in the morning; remember when you could have giant LAN parties with all of your friends and sport some Zerg in a long night of Starcraft and maybe some Warcraft II or Half Life deathmatch?</p>
<p>Remember when you read game reviews in your monthly subscription to see how much reviewers love the game, instead of reading them to try and save money on what games <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> to buy?</p>
<p>You know, the 90’s were a great time.</p>
<p>I honestly thought the 2000’s were going to be good -what with games like Morrowind, Resident Evil 4 and Half Life 2 starting it off- but it all went to dust when money became the goal.</p>
<p>You just don’t get that feeling of love for a game these days, at least not as frequently – not nearly.</p>
<p>That’s why Black Mesa is going to be great, it’s like a personal test for me to see if I can love this as much as the original. I’m gonna try really hard, too.</p>

<p>As long as they keep the focus on first person gameplay, I’m excited.</p>
<p>They could have third person but it really shouldn’t be the “main” view IMO.</p>
