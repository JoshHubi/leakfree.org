    <description>I don&#39;t know if anyone here as seen it, but check out this link. This site is very new. I have no idea if it is real nor do I care because it makes me smile and right now, that is good enough. If it is a fake, it will be down soon enough.

 The One Free Cake:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>-_-</p>
<p>I’m getting tired of this. I do hope that there is at least work going on on Half-Life 3 or episode 3 or whatever, but Valve wouldn’t keep the fact that development was in progress secret. Why? Because that’s stupid. The reason there’s been no word is likely because the company is just embarrassed that they’ve been unable to start the project for whatever reason. They still haven’t perfected Steam, which is probably their biggest money sink right now, so I doubt there’ll be any really stellar games coming out in the near future. And as long as they know they don’t have the funds to pull the game off with the finesse it deserves, they won’t make it. It would simply be a bad decision for everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why is it stupid? If anything it’s the opposite of stupid because of the endless idiots on the internet who will denounce Valve and damn everyone who works there to hell, simply because it isn’t being released fast enough.</p>
<p>Just look at THIS mod and the backlash it’s had simply because of peoples impatience. You can’t give a mouse a cookie without it wanting milk.</p>
<p>They’ve been unable? How can you be that difinitive about something you have no knowledge of?</p>
<p>Steam is their biggest money sink? The thing that more or less revolutionised selling computer games and has more or less destroyed store retail for PC games? The platform that is actually getting bigger every year, in both content and users? Their program that has well over half of all digital distribution on the net on its own? Lol.</p>
<p>You doubt of any games. Yet in the past 5 years we’ve seen more Valve games than before than since the company was founded. All of which have imo been the best games to come out in their respective genres, in both gameplay and aesthetics. Oh and as has already been said, they are in mid development of many games. Including the new CS, which will no doubt be one of their biggest earners to date, and perhaps pioneer cross platform play unlike anything before it.</p>
<p>They have a FPS for literaly every sub-genre, FPS, MP FPS, MP Class based FPS, Survival team based FPS, puzzle FPS. All of which therein are considered to be at the top of their genres, and have had their respective accolades within the past 5 years, yet they are branching out even further now with RTS/RPG. Valve time might be a running joke in the gaming community, but seriously, when did they last release a game that wasn’t thought of in high regard?</p>
<p>Lmao. Seriously, go hate on Valve somewhere else. It’s boring, annoying and you clearly don’t even know what your talking about.</p>

            <p>During the last years, they always had several different projects running. Right now they have three we know of (Dota 2, CS:GO, 2nd Portal 2 DLC). All of them are planned to be released in the near future. Apart from Half-Life none of their Franchises need continuation right now.<br>
Even if you don’t take the so-called clues etc. seriously it is not far fetched that they will announce the next Half-Life game at E3. Of course there would still be a long time between the first announcement and the actual release, so I am not really excited right now.</p>

<p>They joked that at the rate they were going, it would take 18 years to make HL3, so they decided to do the episodes instead.</p>
<p>(HL2 took 3x longer to make than HL1, HL3 would take 3x longer than HL2)</p>
<p>At this rate, we may not get Episode 3 until 18 years after HL2 was released  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

</aside>
<p>That contributed to it being a flop because it had been in development for 12 years, and in the end turned out to be a terrible game in every way possible. It hasn’t lost it’s relevance, infact if anything it could have more relevance today than it did years ago.</p>
<p>As for HL. Who cares it’s been in development so long? If it was important to them? Their flagship series? The one that gave them everything?</p>
<p>I have a feeling all the people saying Valve doesn’t care about HL anymore have no idea what they are talking about.</p>
<p>If anything I’d say the HL community has GROWN because of steam.</p>
<p>Losing it’s relevance? I’m going to bet that view will change once they actually announce it.</p>

            <p>Honestly, whether it comes out or not won’t effect me in the slightest. It’s a video game for crying out loud. Obsessing over such a thing is unhealthy.</p>

            <p>I’d rather Valve take a lot of time to perfect whatever they’re doing with Ep3/HL3 than fall into the black hole of releasing sequel after sequel each year that’s become so popular recently. Ep3/HL3 WILL come out. When? I don’t know, but it will. As much as I’d like to play it I’m content on waiting for Valve to finish it because I know that it’s going to be amazing.</p>

<p>Who else is getting really frustrated by articles online saying “Valve says no HL3 outright” and then all they do is quote them stating they have no affiliation to any ARG or leakage?  Pathetic journalists just copying one another and exaggerating the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was going to say the same thing! I was ready to show how ignorant those journalists were but most of the websites either didn’t have comments or I didn’t care enough to sign up for them.</p>
<p>Just because Valve denies the clues doesn’t mean there is no Half-Life 3! LOL. Saying there is no Half-Life 3 is like saying Valve doesn’t exist! HL3 will come out eventually, whether the current clues are real or not. Putting “No Half-Life 3” in the title of these articles pisses me off. And then these websites copy each other!</p>
<p>And some of the clues ARE legitimate. What about the Lambda and the three shiny lights in one of the Steam Christmas images? And how do you explain the characters shown above Wheatly? Those symbols translated just happen to have a lambda as the first character? Valve may not exactly be hinting at a soon HL3 announcement, but is reminding its followers that the company has no forgotten about the series and that it still has its place.</p>

<p>It is pretty much factual that some where in Valve, at least a few people were developing some things. They aren’t stupid enough to completely let go of Half-life for 4 years.</p>

<p>Half Life 3 is possibly the most anticipated game ever, They would be stupid to not work on it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But was it ever in development? Really and truly in bonafide measurable progressing development?</p>
<p>I think Ep 3 was at some level of “work” but how far did they get? Valve apparently bit off more than they could chew with the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/04/12/is-steam-success-causing-half-life-s-developmental-delay.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Steam delivery platform</a>. It turned out to be so incredibly successful that the requirements to keep it running sucked the HL dev team dry.</p>
<p>To what extent has Ep3/HL3 managed to survive and in what state does it exist? With the loss of personnel to the Steam client and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/06/15/half-life-3-hints-surface.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">people leaving</a> Valve outright… the development of HL was surely hurt… did coding blow up in their face, leaving a tangled train wreak of a mess? Was there another security breach on their servers?</p>
<p>In four plus years, not a single peep. No confirmation OR denial. Numerous OTHER new titles, sequels to those titles and new projects in the interim. Some debunked trolling, one Valve employee even getting in on the act.</p>
<p>Whatever. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> I was going to say more but I deleted it. The above may seem to contradict a previous post of mine, so maybe I should clarify a little:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“I would also rather Valve remain silent than blow past announced dates and have to repeatedly push them back.”</span> <span class="bbcode-b">Another reason I would rather they remain silent is if they balk and the project is canceled outright there will be no (legitimate) shattered dreams, hopes and previously generated excitement of the community.</span></p>
<p>Prove me wrong Valve, but HL-Ep3/HL3 is the new vaporware.</p>
