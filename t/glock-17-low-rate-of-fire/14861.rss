    <title>Glock 17 low rate of fire</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/glock-17-low-rate-of-fire/14861</link>
    <description>Hi all, I looked for a thread about the steam version of the glock but I haven&#39;t found it.
I noticed that the steam version of the glock is quite crappy: in the mod it was much more accurate and it&#39;s rate of fire depended on how fast you could click.
I get it is a weak weapon, but this way it becomes quite useless in advanced levels...
I really enjoyed this version instead of the unaccurate and slow one. Can anyone tell me if there is a way to use it as it was originally programmed to work?
Thank you   :smiley:</description>

            <p>That’s a fair point. I’ll see if we can do anything about that.</p>

            <p>I agree that current firing mechanics is balanced, but one thing is quite illogical, that first shot in alt-fire has same inaccuracy like next shots. First shots should be accurate in both firing modes. I don’t remember  exact glock mechanics in HL1, but I understand if you want to keep it that same way.</p>

<p>What you see is our intentional design for the Glock. The main fire is slow and more accurate, the secondary fire is much faster and less accurate. Same as HL1. A more fun, deep weapon than the mod’s super accurate “fire as fast as you can click” lasergun. Better balanced overall too, given we upped the damage quite considerably.</p>

<p>Seems fair.<br>
Thank you for your quick answer and sorry for my one-year-later reply. I wanted to thank you for all the work you are doing and thrilled to see the fruits of it, whenever it will be.<br>
Have a nice day  ^^</p>
