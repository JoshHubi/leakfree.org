    <description>Hey everyone!

I just started the level &quot;On a Rail&quot; and there you meet a security person who talks about a rocket that I should launch (I don&#39;t have the coordinates, sorry). I went inside his booth to lift the barrier and then he kept standing in the doorframe. Of course I can shoot him, but you know, I am a peaceful person. Just move him a little bit.
