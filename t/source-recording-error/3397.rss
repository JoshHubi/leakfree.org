    <title>Source Recording Error.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-recording-error/3397</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently had quite a few problems inside Source Games, I think I&#39;ve figured it out to be reflectivity issues, and when I playback a demo to be recorded, most surfaces such as water, windows, and anything else that reflects, shows up as the infamous purple and black checkers. But these are slightly transparent with the original surface vaguely showing below.

I haven&#39;t got any screens at the moment, but I think you can get what I mean.

So, any suggestions guys?

Thanks. :3

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll try it out soon.</p>
<p>And they are Half Life 2 maps, not custom ones. So I’d assume that they are complied properly.</p>

            <p>This might be stupid, and might not work, but try (in the console) buildcubemaps.</p>
<p>That should reload reflectivity maps, and might fix it.  Unless for some reason the map is just not compiled correctly.  Again, I use words like “should” “might” and “stupid” because I am not the leading source of knowledge on such things.</p>
<p>But again, it absolutely CANNOT hurt your computer or game to TRY the ‘buildcubemaps’ command, I promise that.  It will require a reload of the map, which will happen automatically.  Probably shouldn’t try it while connected to a server.</p>

            <p>This is a common source recorder error, look at videos of the Assault map on CS:S and look at the air-vents, most people have the purple and black checkers there.</p>
<p>I do not though, source recorder works fine for me, perhaps check your installation for missing files?</p>
