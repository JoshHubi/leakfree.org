    <title>I played the Awakening mod, it sucked.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-played-the-awakening-mod-it-sucked/4930</link>
    <description>After spending an hour or so trying to beat this tedious mod, I thought something this bad deserved a thread about it. Things I didn&#39;t like:
1. Major WTF plot. The Resistance knew Adrian Shepard (I spelled it right!) was being kept in stasis by G-Man [i]in a Resistance base[/i] and were [i]totally okay with that[/i]. Also the whole &quot;Antlions are engineered by the Combine&quot; thing made no sense, since the only thing that the Antlions annoyed more than Gordon Freeman was the Combine.
2. Horrible voice acting. I know it&#39;s a mod, but most of the lines were totally cliche anyways, and the only person that had relatively good lines was G-Man, but the voice actor for him... ew. Reminds me of a guy I know who has the biggest lisp in the world. He sounds like a baby learning to speak, or a preteen who just got their braces.
3. There were two times in the mod about a dozen rollermines were placed in the road, so I had to spend a minutes pointlessly throwing them in the water THAT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE ROAD with the gravity gun.
4. I walk up to an unarmed combine soldier in the first level and he just keeps walking by... nothing suspicious about a dude walking around in a uniform of a now non-existant army in the middle of their newly conquered base...
5. There were so many glitches in the last level... how has that gone unnoticed for so many years?
6. There were multiple points in the game where you&#39;re given no clue on what to do next. Like one, where to open a locked door you have to blow up the window next to it...why would blowing up a window help?

The list goes on... my advice is stay far away from this mod. /rant off</description>

<p>The mod was good.IF you want to complain on something like that fine.They did not make the mod for getting Bad marks and just getting throwed away The voice acting was bad But WHO CARES ABOUT THE GOD DAMN VOICE ACTING!?!???!.You should be more concerned with The gameplay more.This was a fine mod you should stay very close to it if you see it download it.</p>
