    <title>Model detail, prop detail, and clutter distance issues since HL2 update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/model-detail-prop-detail-and-clutter-distance-issues-since-hl2-update/5602</link>
    <description>Hey there. I can&#39;t seem but notice how after the recent EP2 update to HL2 model/prop details keep popping in and out around a mere ten feet, and how clutter (grass, trash, etc) appears at an equally measly distance. I&#39;ve tried going into the console with detaildist and I have also tried to directly change these distances in the cfg file...but everything I do only makes things slightly worse. Is anyone else having this problem, or can anyone help me? 

...or is it because I have a Nvidia 8500 GT?</description>

            <p>Valve never does anything. So we’re pretty much going to probably have that problem with half life 2 forever.</p>

            <p>Actually…yes. That’s the problem exactly. I’ve also noticed that this is not limited to just HL2 and EP1…EP2 seems to have the same shit with railings, clutter, and most noticeably, combine and rebel NPCs.</p>
<p>Any news of Valve recognizing the problem?</p>
