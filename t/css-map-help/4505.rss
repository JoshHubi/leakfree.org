    <description>Im making a basketball map for a mg server I play on frequently, but i need help with a few things.
1 Making a Ball that can be shot and passed.
2 Making a scoreboard (that counts by ones, for each team)
3 How to make the made shots count on the scoreboard and send the teams to there starting positions.

Thanks, and if you want me to post ss I will.</description>

            <p>A cool idea just popped into my head.</p>
<p>Imagine this map, just a simple basket ball board.</p>
<p>5 in each team<br>
Everyone use gravity gun<br>
1 ball - pass it and shoot with the gun.<br>
You shall not shoot from over half the playground (disqualified = dead, and respawn in 30sec)<br>
Pistols may be used - but only one magazine per team, reseted when goal is made.</p>
<p>Couldn’t tackle the bear, they took my stain.</p>
<p>Anyway, can you tell us more about your map?<br>
How’s it gonna be?<br>
I think it sound very interesting and entertaining, if you get it to work!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t have a lot of experience with the source engine much less CSS, but that requires coding.</p>
<p>My suggestion (if you can code CSS?): Is to make a weapon_basketball, so once you get it and pass it off, it leaves your inventory and goes to his. There is a nice tutorial on weapon creation in the Valve developer community and maybe interlopers (I haven’t checked or coded in a while). Let us know if you get something working, sounds like a cool project</p>

<p>Is it my imagination or is that everything minus making a flat court map with a few props for the baskets and scoreboard?</p>

            <p>CSS basketball…is this a gamemode that has been done before? Can you pass/throw/shoot the ball in other maps? If yes, decompile those maps to see how they did everything…</p>
<p>If not, I really have no better suggestions - aside from prescripted shoot/throw with train entities and such, this doesn’t really sound like something that would be easily done in CSS, especially because players can’t pick up physics objects.</p>

<p>I’m not the greatest with hammer, I’ve made decent maps before, but i’ve never actually made a ball. I have the brush made and it is a physbox, but im not sure how to make it equipable and shootable/passable. :retard:</p>

            <p>for 2 and 3 use math_logic with triggers, if the ball goes through the hoop, hve a trigger which adds 1 to a math logic for CT and another for T.<br>
As for the ball make a spherical brush, could be laggy, and set it as func_physbox. Change settings to possible make it bouncy idk.</p>
<p>If you are good as hammer then these instructions do make sense. It still may not work anyway.</p>
