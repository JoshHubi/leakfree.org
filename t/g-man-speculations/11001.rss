    <title>G-Man Speculations</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/g-man-speculations/11001</link>
    <description>Can we get a G-man discussion going? I always liked reading the crazy theories about him.

I find it interesting that in half-life he is actually acknowledged as being there by some of the scientists. There&#39;s the guy having an argument with him in Anomalous Materials and several times an administrator is referenced as overseeing the test chamber experiment. It&#39;s unclear after HL2 if this is referencing G-man or Wallace Breen, the human administrator of Black Mesa. Is the G-man putting on a show at Black Mesa as a human, or do the higher ups know about him? Is he Gordon from the future come back to guide him or government affiliated etc.

How do you see Valve tying up the story with him in the end?</description>

            <p>The G-Man is the Devil.  He comes off as demonic.  He originates from another dimension, his facial expressions, the way he talks, and most of all… contracts.  We know the Devil loves contracts…</p>
<p>All kidding aside, he is inspired heavily from Men In Black (the “real-life” UFO lore one’s, not the Tommy Lee Jones/Will Smith versions).  MIBs according to lore look and sound exactly like the G-Man.  Other examples of characters based off of MIBs would be the Observers in Fringe and the Agents in the Matrix.</p>

<p>I’d have thought that, but the events in Episodes 1 and 2 hint at a deeper plot about him.</p>
<p>G-Man <span class="bbcode-i">caused</span> the Resonance Cascade. He has a definite, if mysterious, agenda. And it’s suggestive that his powers are limited. Remember the vortigaunts were able to mess him up in Episode 1.</p>

<p>Oh, don’t get me wrong, I doubt he does too.  I was just saying if the Advisors true form was like that of G-Man, it would all be over.  I’m guessing a hatched Advisor is still something to be terrified of considering how powerful they are even in larval form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actual speech from memory:</p>
<p>"Furthermore, I have reason to believe that, in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills. The man you have consistently failed to slow, let alone capture, is by all standards- simply that, an ordinary man. How can you have failed to apprehend him?!?</p>
<p>I will leave the upbraiding for another time to the extent that it proves necessary. Now is the moment to redeem yourselves.<span class="bbcode-i"> If the transhuman forces are to prove themselves an indispensable augmentation to the Combine Overwatch, they will have to earn the privilege. I’m sure I don’t have to remind you that the alternative, if you can call it that, is total extinction - in union with all the other unworthy branches of the species. Let’s not allow it to come to that.</span>[I had to look that bit up.] I have done my best to convince Our Benefactors that you are the finest the species has to offer. So far they have accepted my argument, without concrete evidence to back it up. My words sound increasingly hollow, even to me. The burden of proof is on you. As is the consequence of failure. I’ll just leave it at that."</p>
<p>I am suddenly unnerved at how easily I remembered that much of <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Breencast#Dr._Breen_addressing_the_Overwatch" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">that speech.</a> (Probably because it’s my favorite chapter of the whole game…)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That was one of the best things in the game - showing that Breen didn’t just care about power, but that he cared about the human race… It made  Breen seem a reasonable , and sometimes sympathetic antagonist… And sometimes it made you think if rebellion was really that good… He was ready to make sacrifices for the survival of the race… In the end, it made him seem more human, unlike many villains these days.<br>
On topic : I personally think that G-Man has a tendency to double-cross his employers, or at least does his job so it ends badly for the employer  - He was possibly first hired by Nihilanth to provide a new habitat for his race - which he did, in orchestrating resonanse cascade, but then he was contacted by Combine and it resulted in Big N’s demise and Combine’s capture of Xen, then Combine or , at least, Breen hired him to give them Freeman - contract was offered to the highest bidder, as Breen states and he has it, according to his words , to either use him , but G-Man didn’t give them him directly ( possibly on behalf of “people” behind that white door), which basically resulted in the uprising, or just to release him and make a show of his capture, in which case Breen heavily underestimated Gordon, which , again backfired spectacuraly…</p>
<p>But in the end, it seems clear that Breen knew a LOT about G-Man and his activities. He, if nothing else, was the one to order the Anti-Mass spectrometer to be run on 105% , playing directly into G-Man’s hands.</p>

            <p>I always wondered how powerful G-Man is? We can assume he has the following abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teleportation</li>
<li>Dimensional travel</li>
<li>Stopping or slowing time</li>
<li>Putting people into a stasis</li>
</ul>
<p>But that is all we pretty much know.</p>

<p>Actual speech from memory:</p>
<p>"Furthermore, I have reason to believe that, in the intervening years, he was in a state that precluded further development of covert skills. The man you have consistently failed to slow, let alone capture, is by all standards- simply that, an ordinary man. How can you have failed to apprehend him?!?</p>
<p>I will leave the upbraiding for another time to the extent that it proves necessary. Now is the moment to redeem yourselves.<span class="bbcode-i"> If the transhuman forces are to prove themselves an indispensable augmentation to the Combine Overwatch, they will have to earn the privilege. I’m sure I don’t have to remind you that the alternative, if you can call it that, is total extinction - in union with all the other unworthy branches of the species. Let’s not allow it to come to that.</span>[I had to look that bit up.] I have done my best to convince Our Benefactors that you are the finest the species has to offer. So far they have accepted my argument, without concrete evidence to back it up. My words sound increasingly hollow, even to me. The burden of proof is on you. As is the consequence of failure. I’ll just leave it at that."</p>
<p>I am suddenly unnerved at how easily I remembered that much of <a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Breencast#Dr._Breen_addressing_the_Overwatch" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">that speech.</a> (Probably because it’s my favorite chapter of the whole game…)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think that’s a practical plan; the combine strategy, as far as we know, is to harvest the resources of captured worlds and use a planet’s own assets against it. They’re draining the oceans and turning humans into soldiers, heavily using existing weapons and infrastructure, etc, etc.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, getting the combine to expand somewhere and then cutting them off there wouldn’t do much to destabilize their empire, which may very well be why the combine operate as they do. They don’t seem to have moved any unique, irreplaceable assets to earth, even going so far as to appropriate existing leaders, like Breen.</p>
<p>Getting them to expand somewhere and then destroying that expansion would most likely result in a net gain of resources for the combine. That won’t further any goals; it would hardly even be suitable as a method to delay them and work your own plans.</p>
<p>On the other hand, his strategy might be to aid earth just enough to create something - weapons, soldiers, unity between humans and vortigaunts - that can counter the combine, which might be a lot more effective.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think we can fully say for sure yet what the Combine’s plan for Earth is. If they just want Earth’s resources, why keep the Earth’s population alive? Why not just take what they need and kill the rest? If they intend to simply conquer and rule Earth indefinitely, why suppress reproduction? If they want the Earth to continue to produce resources for them, why prevent new sources of labor? Why not like a selective breeding program instead, breeding the best possible soldiers and workers?</p>
<p>Here’s another thought: We can see/infer from the game and the writings of Marc Laidlaw that the Combine have become so technologically advanced that they’ve essentially let their bodies go, sorta like the humans from Wall-E. Perhaps they’ve become stagnant in their intelligence or creativity, or maybe they’ve hit a wall trying to develop new technology. What if they’re purposely oppressing the earth to put pressure on the subjugated populace to create new weapons and technology? Breen says they could have taken Eli at any time, implying they knew about his location and activities, and only until Gordon arrived, only until there was a true, credible threat to the Combine, did they take action.</p>

<p>He says Gordon was in a state that precluded development of covert skills. Interestingly, while Breen knows that, he seems unaware of what Gordon is actually capable of, otherwise he would not have been so upset with the Overwatch (unless he was just trying to motivate them). Perhaps G-man purposely did not tell him everything in order to lead him into a trap?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You say you think the resistance outbid the Combine for Gordon’s contract, but none of the resistance leaders (Barney, Vance, Kleiner) seemed to expect his return:  they were quite surprised.  What’s more, none of them seem to like the G-Man.  Certainly not Eli Vance, as he implies in Ep2.  And the Vorts (who are part of the resistance) seem to be fighting with G-Man throughout Ep1 and 2 for control over Gordon.  So I doubt Gordon was ever officially “working for” the resistance.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, Barney, Isiac, Eli and Alyx seem to expect his arrival.  In HL2 you actually see The Gman and Odessa Cubbage talking right before you get to NLO and cubbage talks about the new rockets they Just got. As for the liking, the humans are near the end. They haven’t had a child born in two decades. They are on the verge of extinction and making cause with someone you hate out of desperation is nothing new. Gordon took out Nova Prospect, Sparked the uprising, brought down breen and took out the Citadel. Gman mentions interesting offers at the end of HL2, then gordon and alyx were pulled out of a fusion explosion by the vorts. He comes back in EP2 and mentions restrictions and how he is to abide by them</p>

<p>Yes he does. He evidently had a debate with the gman about the relative value of a child alyx offer the destruction of black mesa where he was the naysayer.<br>
OH MAH GAWD IN THE NAME OF ALL THINGS HOLE-E WHERE IS HALF LIFE THREE!!!</p>
