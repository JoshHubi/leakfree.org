    <title>Flashlight bug</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flashlight-bug/10196</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

I got a annoying bug with the flashlight. It does not light correctly, it lights the props/door, but not the wall. 
Here&#39;s some screenshot (with flashlight on):

[url]https://www.noelshack.com/2012-37-1347788104-bm-c1a2a0002.jpg[/url]

Anyone knows how to fix it?

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I can confirm that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The latest driver (306.23 - September 2012) fixes the flashlight problem, but creates a new problem where shadows are big black rectangles.</li>
<li>The newest working driver I for me is 285.58 from October 2011</li>
<li>All drivers downloaded from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Nvidia’s drivers page</a>
</li>
<li>Nvidia should reconsider its QA procedures or change its slogan to “New Driver, New Bug”.</li>

            <p>Guys, thanks for continuing your investigations on this. It’s good to know the latest normally working version of the driver for 7xxx cards.</p>

            <p>That’s probably because people with cards that old don’t bother updating the drivers very often.</p>
<p>I’ll test out the 285.62 sometime tomorrow, need to get some sleep.</p>

            <p>I went the other way and started to check from the latest drivers downward - everything started to work fine on 285.62 drivers from October 2011 which makes them almost year old. That’s funny that no one with 7xxx GF cards found out that flashlight was not working in Source Engine for that long  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>You don’t even have to roll them back that far. I started with 275.33 and the bug went away. I think once you get into the 301.42 drivers is when it becomes a problem.<br>

<p>In short: try downgrading your driver version through 2xx.xx and down to 1xx.xx series one version by one until you find what version would finally provide you with a bug-free shadows/flashlight experience. Report back your findings to this topic please. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Try to downgrade drivers even more, maybe even to 1xx.xx branches of the driver. There was a time HL2 had been working OK with these GPUs so it’s just a matter of time and effort to find a driver release where the things got messed up.</p>
<p>P.S. Unless this bug only happen in fresher version of the Source engine. What about Half-Life: Lost Coast techdemo - how does flashlight perform in it on your system? Or in HL: Source - is it working ok there?</p>

<p>In HL2, HLep1, HL2ep2 the flashlight works perfectly, whether I’m running it on high details or in low details. So it’s not about how one set the light settings or the shadows one.</p>

</aside>
<p>You know, when the same piece of the code works OK for someone and do not work for another person usually there should be some reason - some difference in hardware or software environment - which causes the misbehavior. As far as it goes it seems that people having 7XXX GT nVIDIA cards suffer from this problem. You hadn’t specified your system specs so I urge you to do so - it would help us to pinpoint the cause of the problem and - possibly - find a solution. And could you please start up the game, open up the console, execute “find flash” and copy/paste the entire output to this thread?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit.</span> Argh, so it might be driver-related issue for 7xxx series of nVIDIA cards then. Nice finding. Could you please try downloading/installing some older version of the nVIDIA drivers for your card and report your findings here so people on forum could benefit from your work? Thanks in advance.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>By reading all similar topics on these forums I assume that it is a GPU driver related problem which occurs only on 7xxx nVidia cards. All people complaining about black square shadows or non-working flashlights have 7xxx cards (including me, I have 7900 GTX).</p>
<p>Reverting to previous drivers gives me exact effects (working shadows, no flashlight). Having to choose between working shadows OR working flashlight is not exactly a solution so it seems we have to wait for new drivers from nVidia to release or get a new GPU  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’m having exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>In HL2, HLep1, HL2ep2 the flashlight works perfectly, whether I’m running it on high details or in low details. So it’s not about how one set the light settings or the shadows one.</p>
<p>I have the drivers of my nvidia up to date.</p>
<p>Getting into a duct is impossible to me :S</p>
<p>EDIT: I checked playing HL2 and it has the same bug, so it has to be a driver problem. I formated my PC yesterday and installed the latest driver of my card, maybe that latest version is failing.</p>
<p>EDIT2: It’s obvious but before formating and with the old drivers version, I didn’t have that issue on HL2.</p>

            <p>Strange. I have a GeForce 7950 GT and the mod is running very smooth with all graphic settings set to High (the recommended) or Very High. Only exception is the missing light from the flashlight (only lights up movable objects - not the environment).<br>
Anywho, I tried switching around many combinations of settings, but no changes on that part.</p>

<p>For the people running GeForce 7xxx-9xxx series. Just buy a damn xbox or upgrade your card. I can’t believe people still have those and I thought my GTX285 was getting old!</p>
<p>You can get a card for less than $100 that would perform much better and at least support DX10 or even DX11.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some people have laptops with no option to upgrade except to buy another 800$ laptop. Also I hope you realize that a geforce 8800-9800 series can run all of the latest games on medium-high no problem, even with an old Core 2 Duo. A geforce 8600 can play them on Low-Med but older than that it’s much slower. The Geforce 7950, even the dual card will struggle to play GTA IV or even WoW on anything other than very low, but still plays any valve game on highest setting and the fps depending on CPU mostly.</p>
<p>Unless you are running a single core Celeron with Intel GMA graphics or something older than Geforce 6600 or Radeon x1300, your problems are software related.</p>

<p>Not that simple. GTS 250 which is almost the same as GTX 9800 which is mostly the same as GTX 8800 actually perform at the same speed in HL2 and most older games as GTX 550 Ti. The only difference that GTX 550 could handle tesselation and some other nice OpenGL4.x/DX10/11 stuff while GTS 250 couldn’t. Check Toms Hardware or any other hw review site for detailed benchmarks.</p>
<p>But still, even keeping in mind that GTS 250 is a damn old GPU while GTX 550 Ti half a year ago costed at around 200 USD - why one would want to pay extra 200 bucks to get exactly (if not worse) the same performance in DX9-age games (most console ports are)?</p>

<p>nVidia Driver - as i said - is the latest.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Be more specific, you’re not a spy to hide facts. What is “the latest” version in your definition? Is it a beta driver from 306.x branch or it’s a latest driver from 304.x branch? Had you changed anything in nVIDIA driver control panel? Had you used any of the “maximize FPS in Source games” configs available on the net? Also, looking at the screenshot you posted it seems that you had specularity and bump/parallax mapping turned off in the game. Could you add the followind settings to yours BMS autoexec.cfg and check if it helps:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
cl_showfps 2<br>
fps_max 120</p>
<p>mat_alphacoverage 1<br>
mat_compressedtextures 1</p>
<p>mat_specular 1<br>
mat_bumpmap 1<br>
mat_parallaxmap 1<br>
mat_queue_mode 0<br>
r_threaded_particles 1<br>
r_threaded_renderables 1</p>
<p>dsp_slow_cpu 1<br>
snd_mix_async 1<br>
snd_async_fullyasync “1”</p>
<p>cl_predict 1<br>
cl_smooth 1<br>
cl_forcepreload 1<br>
sv_forcepreload 1</p>
<p>fog_enable_water_fog 1</p>
<p>r_dynamic 1<br>
r_dynamiclighting 1<br>
r_maxdlights 16</p>
<p>r_flashlightdepthtexture 0</p>
<p>texture_budget_panel_x 550<br>
texture_budget_panel_y 112<br>
texture_budget_panel_height 450<br>
texture_budget_panel_width 512<br>
budget_panel_x 0<br>
budget_panel_y 50<br>
budget_panel_height 900<br>
budget_panel_width 512</p>
<p>alias BudgetShow “sv_cheats 1; +showbudget; showbudget_texture 1; alias BudgetToggle BudgetHide;”<br>
alias BudgetHide “-showbudget; sv_cheats 0; showbudget_texture 0; alias BudgetToggle BudgetShow;”<br>
alias BudgetToggle “BudgetShow;”<br>
bind b BudgetToggle<br>
bind n “incrementvar texture_budget_panel_global 0 1 1”</p>
<p>alias +walk “sv_maxspeed 120;”<br>
alias -walk “sv_maxspeed 320;”[/code]</p>
<p>Also, you could try lowering “Shadows details” in gfx settings down to “Low” and lowering textures details (as your GPU has only 256Mb - which might be not enough) to a middle quiality setting (or simply set mat_picmip 1 in the in-game console).</p>
<p>Don’t forget that after doing any change to the game gfx settings you’d better quit and restart the game: it is known to misbehave crashing and doing all other nasty things if you change something like mat_picmip or enable or disable HDR in the middle of the playsession.</p>
<p>P.S. Also, could you try disabling HDR and check if it works? Or enabling it in case you have it disabled.<br>
P.P.S. Do not use dxlevel 80 or 81 with BMS - it would lead to visual glitches. If you had changed dxlevel using mat_dxlevel - quit the game and all “-dxlevel 90” (or 95) to the command line parameters of the BMS. Start up the game once and then quit it. Remove “-dxlevel 90” from the start up parameters and you’re good to go with the game switched into using dxlevel 90 renderpath.</p>

            <p>I’ll keep it short:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fire up BM<br>
flashlight only works on select props, making it p. much useless.<br>
mess with settings (in-game and nvidia CP), no dice<br>
update to 306.23 nvidia drivers<br>
flashlight works. Yay. <a href="https://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/937003620230682020/23BFF76EA41557083EF0E32E5561FC6553C5A9D3/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">All shadows are completely fucked</a><br>
mess with settings (in-game and nvidia CP). No dice.<br>
downgrade to 301.42. Shadows fine, flashlight doesn’t work.<br>
downgrade to 296.10. Same difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve tried different source games and mods and these bugs are consistent across all.<br>
I hadn’t played a source game for quite some time until BM, so I can’t tell when the flashlight bug first occurred or what could have possibly caused it.<br>
I haven’t changed any hardware.</p>

            <p>Hi!<br>
nVidia Driver - as i said - is the latest.<br>
The command “r_newflashlight” set to 0 and same problem. Some surface is illuminating others are not. Not require “sv_cheat 1”.<br>
Tested “mat_dxlevel”:<br>
80 - flashlight light is look good, but texture bugs<br>
90, 91, 95 - same problem (95 is default).</p>
