    <title>Xbox 360 RROD has returned</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xbox-360-rrod-has-returned/4268</link>
    <description>NOTE: DO NOT FLAME. DO NOT FLAME. DO NOT FLAME OR DIE. SERIOUSLY I WAS ALREADY FLAMED ENOUGH ABOUT THIS SHIT. PLZ DO NOT FLAME. IF YOU DONT BELIEVE THIS SHIT THEN YOU SHOULDNT EVEN BE ON THIS THREAD. DO NOT FLAME.

Now that everybody&#39;s gotten the message...

the RROD has returned.

Microsoft has brought the dreaded disease back to life.. for it is now spreading

through more Xbox 360s worldwide. (including mine *sniffle*)

But anyway... the RROD can be fixed with simple household items.. HOWEVER...

It will have to be repaired every 2-3 months. Oh sure, there&#39;s nothing bad

about the fact that you can FIX it. but it is bad that Microsoft is still putting

these damn RROD infected things on the market.

So what do you think?

Is it a hoax?

Or is Microsoft trying to make a quick buck, even IF they were already sued.

Whatever this is..it must be stopped. The RROD must not show its&#39; ugly lights 

NO MORE. PLZ...think pf the little nerd children.</description>

            <p>Seriously. Never had any problems with my slim but then I’ve only had it about a year. My old 360 lasted until just under the warranty before shitting out and they replaced it for free. Honestly though why would people give a shit about RROD. If you’re not fucking retarded it doesn’t happen very quickly and should still be under warranty anyway.<br>
Actually yeah MS loses more money to this than they do make any. Because of warranties.</p>
<p>Bscly don’t be retarded and put your fucking console in heattraps. Or have it on while the vents are in the carpet like a god damn casual.</p>
<p>Edit: I only just realised how old this thread was. oh well i dont give a fuck</p>

            <p>Well, I had two Xbox 360s die on me. First one was after three months, second one was after a year. My current one has been fine so far, but that’s probably because I don’t play it very much. It also scratched up my CoD4 disc for no apparent reason once.</p>
<p>But if I didn’t think it was a worthwhile investment, why do I have upwards of 30 games for it?</p>
