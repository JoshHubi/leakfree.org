    <title>Silent Hills</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/silent-hills/13404</link>
    <description>At Gamescom there was this weird teaser for a game called PT and then right after the conference an &quot;interactive teaser&quot; was put up on the PS4 store. It was a first person horror game that seemed to require a lot of puzzle solving to actually beat. Someone did beat it though and at the end it was revealed to be a new Silent Hill game with Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro, and Norman Reedus (from the Walking Dead and Boondock Saints) involved. Running on the Fox Engine. 

Actual game is going to be third person though. No word on whether it&#39;s PS4 exclusive or not. Or why the game&#39;s name is Silent Hill*s*.

I hope it&#39;s not PS4 exclusive.</description>

            <p>Most likely a reboot, which is good.</p>

</aside>
<p>Presumably they wanted a name that was cooler than “Silent Hill #” but not one that could be confused with the first game.</p>

            <p>Did not see it coming. Glad Silent Hill is back to a Japanese studio and on good hands.</p>
