    <title>Possible Psychonauts Sequel?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-psychonauts-sequel/6478</link>
    <description>So, I was playing Psychonauts earlier today, and went into Steam&#39;s overlay to look up something in the web browser, and saw [url=&#39;https://kotaku.com/5688018/psychonauts-creator-is-totally-ready-for-a-sequel&#39;]this[/url] as the newest article in the news section.

Obviously it doesn&#39;t mean that there [i]will[/i] be a sequel, but the fact that Schafer even wants to and is hopefully looking for a publisher to fund it is great news to me. Psychonauts is in my Top 3 Games of all time, so I&#39;d be unbelievably excited for it to come out with a sequel

What do you guys think? And sorry if this is old news.</description>

            <p>Gosh, now that I think of it, I really gotta finish Psychonauts… I got my new lappie, the game runs to smoothly <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ve heard comments like that, CTID, so I am a bit scared of getting there &gt;.&lt; Last time I got up to Velvetopia, but lost my files… Gonna start again and see how the last level is  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I also have a question for others who’ve played Psychonauts to the end. Why all the hate for the last level? It definitely wasn’t my favorite, but it was by no means difficult, and it definitely doesn’t fit anywhere near my all-time least favorite video game levels like a lot of you guys seem to think it is.</p>

            <p>Which is a damn shame. I played through a few chapters of the game not long ago on my 360. Hilarious writing and brilliant direction.</p>

            <p>Well not until that article has he explicitly stated “I’m ready to make a sequel.” beforehand he’s just stated that if he were to make one, that it’d be after they were done making Brutal Legend.</p>
