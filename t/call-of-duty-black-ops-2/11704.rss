            <p>Just picked it up. It’s pretty good I guess. I like what they’ve done with zombies. And the multiplayer is quite a treat, I love playing with all these badass guns. Single player could be better, but it also could be A LOT worse. I’ve enjoyed this one more than black ops. I still think Call of Duty (thd original Game of the Year edition) is my favorite CoD, hell, it’s one of my top ten favorite games.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Indeed. CoD 1 is still in my top three of all-time favourite games, and I don’t see that changing any time soon.</p>
<p>I really wish that the sequels would have been nothing more than graphical updates and more levels to the original.</p>
<p>At this point it’s just surreal trying to imagine that these games are even in the same series, it’s like trying to convince me that Halo 4 is a sequel to Diablo.</p>
<p>As for my general opinions on Blops 2, I’ll have to get back to that later, I’m not even done with the game yet and I can’t be arsed to write out an essay at 00:05.</p>

            <p>It does kinda suck. COD II is one of my favorite shooters ever. I just hate to see it go when there’s so much great that can be done with the formula. It went down the wrong path and now it’s probably unsalvageable.</p>
<p>It’s like finding out the kind that was voted most likely to succeed and had rich parents grew up to be a meth addict and a prostitute.</p>

            <p>Well mines going back tomorrow. I got literally everything I could out of it within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Campaign is one of the worst I’ve ever played.<br>
Multiplayer caters to extreme camping and extreme casuals.<br>
( Auto-aim is beyond insane especially considering the lack of recoil. Small, open maps in conjunction with poor spawning means being shot in the back 5 seconds from spawn. However, for the epitome of their design abilities… a gadget that acts like a 360 degree proximity mine, that bounces into the air when triggered and can actually be thrown. You can carry two if you wish. ).<br>
Zombies seems like more of a downgrade with what they did in Black Ops. Full of cheap gimmicks.</p>
<p>I’m gonna go trade it in tomorrow, meaning I’ll of spent £10 on it. Should of been a rent.</p>
<p>Out of all of the CoDs I’d rate this as bad as MW3. This is from someone who rates Black Ops the best. I feel the series will no doubt be dead by next gen, Activision running another series into the ground with yearly updates that serve no other purpose than to make more money.</p>

            <p>Watched a review for it on Good Game; I reckon they’re really CoD-biased. Also, it looks like shit. I’m surprised this is where most of the graphics nerds come from, I’ve seen Dreamcast games that look better!</p>

            <p>The game’s called Black Cops, but there’s no cops in it. It sucks!</p>
<p>I heard some stuff about it, and enough not to actually bother playing it myself. And for reason, I say Medal of Honor is back in the saddle with kicking CoD’s ass.</p>

            <p>I boycott Activision(For various reasons), and as such I have still never played a CoD game…</p>
<p>Gotta say though, this one looks better than MW3. I think I saw people riding horses while shooting robots in the trailer, so it can’t be 100% bad xD</p>

<p>Treyarchs attempt at RTS/FPS hybrid in the form of ‘strike force missions’ are, to put it bluntly, an absolute abomination.

The layout of these ‘missions’ is also terrible, pitting you against endless supplies of enemies in which your outnumbered 20-1, in maps with very little cover as is.

<p>What?? Aw, man… that was the only part of this game that I was even remotely intrigued about…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I didn’t even plan on getting BO1. My cousin just so happens to be the manager of his local GameStop (and also a former Marine), and he “happened” to stop by a party with his “work” (a nice pile of tons of games to play and get familiar with). One of those happened to be Black Ops. He just said I could keep it. I didn’t really complain… it was a free game, so I just played it. It was meh okay, I guess… but doesn’t really compare to CoD4MW1, IMO.</p>
<p>At least it was free though. Maybe he’ll just happen to “stop by” with his “work” again one of these days… yeah…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>This kind of game is why I laughed at the faces of all the reviewers on the Net now. A bunch of tools.</p>
<p>You like COD? Play the first Black ops or COD4… I don’t like this series, but at least, these ones are fairly good compared to this piece of sh*t with a 6-years old scripted story. Oh, I forget, with plenty of glitches that spoil your fun too.</p>
<p>I think this game is the beginning of the end, just like how the Guitar Hero series died.</p>
<p>Activision have a reputation of a franchise-killer.</p>

            <p>He’s right, the single player is terrible. Not even hilariously so, just terrible.</p>
<p>I quite liked the storyline of Black Ops 1. It was over the top and historically inaccurate all over but it was fun and held a strong narrative. Black Ops 2 however is absolutely shit, Seemingly written by a group of teenagers for a high school writing class. I’d go into it but it isn’t worth the bother.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself however is. The scripting is awful by standards set 10 years ago, let alone todays. Friendlies will completely ignore enemies should the script tell them to move forward. Animations are even worse. Enemy helicopters, or any such vehicle will instantly explode into an ugly mess once its hit points are depleted. Enemies still have dying, peaking and general moving animations reminiscent of the original medal of honors.</p>
<p>Treyarchs attempt at RTS/FPS hybrid in the form of ‘strike force missions’ are, to put it bluntly, an absolute abomination. Unresponsive commands due to both poor input and having to control said terrible A.I would be the first and major problem / reason for not attempting such a thing. The layout of these ‘missions’ is also terrible, pitting you against endless supplies of enemies in which your outnumbered 20-1, in maps with very little cover as is. A clear indication the developers at Treyarch have simply not played an RTS game in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The multiplayers problems consist not of bad level design, as they are actually quite well done. It’s the gun mechanics that let it down. Within the first two days the game has devolved into nothing but the highest rate of fire weapons being used exclusively, on account of there being practically zero recoil. Changes such as the pick 10 system are good, however it doesn’t offer up the kind of variety it could due to the rather absurdly long process to unlock everything on account of the target audience.</p>
<p>In game you have the endless UAVs, leaving you near enough constantly on the enemies radar, which in conjunction with the small, yet open maps leave you consistently unable to form any kind of tactical route or style of play. This again has seemingly been reinforced by Treyarch, who have added in stun mine gadgets, 360 proximity mines ( an upgrade from directional claymores ), ‘slow down beam’ scorestreaks and other such things. Which imo shows a lack of understanding when considering what challenges players whilst still being fun.</p>
<p>Added to that the community, whos idea of a tactics is to jump around every corner shooting or simply going prone the second they see someone, adds to the annoyance and feeling the game simply isn’t designed well, trying to be a tactical game whilst not overcoming the major problems that plague its attempts to do so.</p>
<p>I’l be playing it a bit more, but it’s more than likely going back. Trade it in now whilst I can still get something decent for it and put it towards GTA.</p>

<p>Does it still have that feature where the weapon automatically snaps to an enemy when you aim down the sights?</p>
<p>I still find it hard to believe that they practically removed <span class="bbcode-i">aiming</span> from a linear first-person shooter.</p>
