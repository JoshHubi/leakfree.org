    <title>Berets give 5 health points to players</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/berets-give-5-health-points-to-players/14633</link>
    <description>This eerie psychic phenomenon was tested both in the official maps and other user made maps.

Take a look at the health meter and the haunted beret. Please watch from 0:32 if you want to skip loading screen, etc. (I apologize for the low quality of the video)

I took this shorter video to make it sure. This time, with some more berets.

As seen in this video, not all berets have spirits in them.</description>

            <p>Now I’m picturing Gordon walking around Black Mesa, with a huge stack of berets perched precariously atop his head, reaching up to the ceiling. Nothing can stop him, he is impervious to damage as the Marines empty magazine after magazine of ammunition into him. His berets give him authority. His berets give him strength.</p>
<p>Berets are love. Berets are life.</p>

<p>I believe this was a little silly joke, which was in the mod release too (though I may be mistaken).</p>
<p>It’s pretty silly, but so are the drink cans from the vending machine giving you 1 health each. You try drinking 20 cans of soft drink and see if you feel healthier by the end of it!</p>

<p>Oh, I see. Of course it was intended… I guess was stupid!</p>

<p>Does that mean these are medics’ berets?</p>

<p>I believe Gordon is just sucking their soul out. Soldiers are usually extremely attached to their hats, much like players in Team Fortress 2. Commandiers sacrificed their soul to earn the red berets to signify their ranks. Gordon just suck the soul out of it and gain 5 HP. On the day Gordon gains exactly 666,666 HP from the berets, Half-Life 3 will be released.</p>
