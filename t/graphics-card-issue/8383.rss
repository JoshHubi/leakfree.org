    <title>Graphics Card issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/graphics-card-issue/8383</link>
    <description>For the last two years I&#39;ve had the same Graphics Card, its always worked fine but just today I pulled it out to clean out the whole computer, get the dust and such out, I&#39;ve talked to a few people thinking it was the power supply going bad or the motherboard but everyone is saying the same thing. I&#39;m kinda cheap though so before I invest on a new Graphics Card I guess I want some other oppinions.

Anyways the issue is whenever the graphics card is out, my desktop starts up just fine, but with it installed all the fans rev slow and fast slow and fast and the power light flashes, then after about 30 seconds it just settles but dosent boot up or show anything on the screen.

I&#39;ve tried other spots to connect the power on the unit, I&#39;ve tried dissconnecting RAM, making sure all the cables are tight and secure, nothing works. Any help or oppinions would help alot.</description>

<p>have you recently connected it to another external display like a hd tv?</p>

<p>actually yes I did, I hooked it up using HDMI, it worked fine once but when I decided to turn it off and clean around it some more, thats when it stopped working. I was originally trying to hook up the SPDIF wire but it didn’t work, got no sound. I was trying other areas on the motherboard when the graphics card started revving up and down, thats when I stopped and was more concerned about getting the darn thing to display.</p>

<p>I did this once. Card went to extend desktop automatically. Screen was all dark and thought it was defective. However, in this case seems the weird fan activity would indicate something more complex.</p>
