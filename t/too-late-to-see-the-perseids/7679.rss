    <title>Too late to see the Perseids?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/too-late-to-see-the-perseids/7679</link>
    <description>I live in the DC Maryland Virginia area and I just found out today there was going to be a meteor shower. Is it too late to see the meteor shower? Is it practical to wait for it considering the moons blocking the way? Please respond.</description>

            <p>Pretty much way before and way after a meteor shower, there are still plenty of shooting stars. I saw a bunch of them the other night aswell, so if it’s a clear night, get out there and start watching. It might not be as spectacular, but it should still be good.</p>
