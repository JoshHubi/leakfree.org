    <title>Some problems in the Osprey sequence in Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/some-problems-in-the-osprey-sequence-in-surface-tension/11088</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t have any screenshot, nor coordinates, but the part is easy to find...The osprey+tank sequence...
The are many things that work weird in that level.
First, infinite soldiers. I know it&#39;s not a bug, but it could be fixed to a certain number...maybe.
Second...when I die in that part the death camera falls to the void like if I used no clip...
Third, if I use the RPG some times gets stuck, and I can&#39;t shoot or change the weapon.
Fourth, the hive hand of the alien grunt does a mess with the crate box physics. The boxes go bouncy somehow. Once...I stroke a box with the crowbar then I was impulsed very very far...I died from the fall.
And last...the tank didn&#39;t died when I shot it. I skipped it.</description>

            <p>I’m ok with the infinite soldiers, that was a suggestion. I think all the other things are a lot more important (I already mirrored them to the bug tracker).<br>
Come on, falling to the void or having rocket bugs are a lot more discussion worthy people…</p>

            <p>Yeah the infinite soldiers is actually needed for that section of the game if there were limited soldiers the osprey would stop flying in, and considering that destroying it is the way you proceed past that section</p>

            <p>Infinite soldiers is fun as. No place is better for some slaughter. Finally I got to actually use all of the ammo I had been stocking for once. Rip out your sv_cheats 1, give all and have the time of your life. Sourcegamer already explained it.</p>

            <p>This shows a lot of the things that I found. Surface Tension is a little glitchy…<br>
