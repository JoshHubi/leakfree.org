[quote]
[b]Valve’s just confirmed that Portal 2 will feature cross-platform play  between PS3 and both PC and Mac owners of the game when it releases in  April.[/b]

 
 [b]Features also confirmed a “persistent cloud-based storage of PS3 saved games” as well as cross-platform chat on PS3, PC and Mac.[/b]


 [b]Valve’s also confirmed it’ll include a “Steam Play” of the game with  every copy of the PS3 version, which means a Steam key for the PC and  Mac version will be included.[/b]

It&#39;s like Valve wants us to love them or something.</description>

<blockquote>
<p>so let me see if i can sum this thread up. someone mentioned that ps3 owners get 2 copies of a game called portal 2. one disc for ps3 and a code for pc. all the ps3 owners of the forum start blowing loads everywhere in excitement. then fancy pants mentions " hey, does this not seem rather hypocritical of a major game company to do when just a year or 2 before said company hated this console. it seems like they are brown nosing the hell out of play station owners."&lt;-- this is a valid(if slightly biased) point to make. then, instead of being rational, all the people who were celebrating look up from there sephoroth/cloud slash fics long enough to scream FAGGOT <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">XBOX FAN BOY</span></span>!!! and start trolling and fighting with <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">him </span></span>because…fuck it there is no reason they just hate fanboy’s of the other console. so then maxey and garth bartin both decide to take this and run with it leading to a insult fight between the 3 of them, finally resulting in garthbartin blocking fancypants and pretending to take the moral high ground</p>

<p>Console manufacturers always get a cut for every game sold. If Valve included a PS3 code in the PC version, Sony wouldn’t get that cut. I’m almost sure this is just exclusive to the PS3 copy.</p>
<p>However, I don’t think nothing is stopping Valve from including a Steam key in each 360 copy, as long as MS gets the cut from each copy sold.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But the problem with that is that you still need to link the console with your steam ID and MS would never never valve get away with that on their console. If valve could directly import DLC to your console through steam, MS would want to charge 15 bucks per transaction. Otherwise, since they aren’t linked, you essentially get two copies and you could just sell the other one and that would be selling someone elses work, which is of course illegal.</p>

<p>Also, it’s incredibly unlikely (like, 110% unlikely) that this would ever happen on the 360. MS would never allow steamworks features on their prized xbl.</p>

<p>That was actually pretty fucking far off. Guess what? I’ve never even played a PS3 game for more than like 30 mins.

I didn’t block her because of this argument, I blocked her because she’s trolling douchebag. And then, the argument was never that much about whether it was hypocritical, but whether or not PC users will get a PS3 copy like PS3 users get a pc copy.

Changing your mind doesn’t make you a hypocrite. They no longer think PS3 sucks, Gabe made jokes about they’re former dislike of Sony.</p>
<p>Also, is it just me or is it getting really really annoying every time a news article/ps3 fanboy says “Valve promised the PS3 version of Portal 2 would be the best”?

            <p>To be honest looking at the retail price on <a href="http://play.com" rel="nofollow noopener">play.com</a> and <a href="http://amazon.com" rel="nofollow noopener">amazon.com</a> for Portal 2 it would indicate that the PC version WILL NOT include a copy for your PS3, the retail price of the console versions seem to be around £5 more and therefore if the PC version did also include a PS3 version it would be at least the same retail.</p>
<p>It does leave the door open for valve to sell licences in the future which would allow any game to be played from either platform for a set price. A fantastic step forward for those of us who prefer PC gaming to console gaming.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what the point is in getting Portal 2 for PS3 if you have a decent PC. Have you ever seen HL2 on the 360 Orange Box (which is supposedly better than the PS3 version)? It looks like shit compared to playing it on a PC with everything set on full. The difference will probably be smaller this time, but I bet the PC version will still look better.</p>

            <p>so let me see if i can sum this thread up. someone mentioned that ps3 owners get 2 copies of a game called portal 2. one disc for ps3 and a code for pc. all the ps3 owners of the forum start blowing loads everywhere in excitement. then fancy pants mentions " hey, does this not seem rather hypocritical of a major game company to do when just a year or 2 before said company hated this console. it seems like they are brown nosing the hell out of play station owners."&lt;-- this is a valid(if slightly biased) point to make. then, instead of being rational, all the people who were celebrating look up from there sephoroth/cloud slash fics long enough to scream FAGGOT XBOX FAN BOY!!! and start trolling and fighting with him because…fuck it there is no reason they just hate fanboy’s of the other console. so then maxey and garth bartin both decide to take this and run with it leading to a insult fight between the 3 of them, finally resulting in garthbartin blocking fancypants and pretending to take the moral high ground</p>
<p>tl;dr version: everyone in this thread<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">(me included for totally different reasons)</span></span> has internet assburgers syndrome. instead of posting a mature debate, they all degrade down into fucktard’s and fight over meaningless shit trying to prove a point they don’t really remember AND trying to save face.<br>
i take back anything i said about you people being mature or humorous. your all 12 years old and what is internet tough guy?</p>
