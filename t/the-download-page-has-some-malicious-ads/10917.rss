    <title>The download page has some malicious ads.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-download-page-has-some-malicious-ads/10917</link>
    <description>I was trying to sleep last night when my little brother came in freaking out saying black mesa was a virus. I was cranky and telling him it wasn&#39;t a virus. I got up out of bed to see what was happening to his computer. he had installed some random installer from i don&#39;t know where. I went to the download page to see what he downloaded from here that made him do this.

and bam, a big blue &quot;download&quot; button is there. that wasn&#39;t there when i downloaded it because i have adblock on firefox.

I have marked the imposter download link with a big red box. and now there is an ad at the bottom with another imposter download button.

Seeing this, i see where he might have been confused and hit the big blue download button.

I would have emailed staff, but i wanted to warn other people about this as well.</description>

<p>That makes no sense. They only make money when you click them, what, do you click them (click fraud) or are you genuinely interested in the ads?</p>

<p>Not entirely true. It’s a combination of impressions (views) and clicks that determine how much is made. I’ll look into disabling the ads that have fake download buttons.</p>

            <p>I remember when similar ads were on the frontpage, IIRC the admins blacklisted them. So yeah, I think they can.</p>

            <p>Don’t we have some sort of system up where the admins can blacklist certain ads from appearing on the site?</p>
<p>…I thought we did.</p>
