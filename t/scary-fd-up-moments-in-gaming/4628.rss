    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scary-fd-up-moments-in-gaming/4628</link>
    <description>As the title says, post descriptions in moments of games that you made you jump or made you think the developers had a spot of bad acid. Spoilers be ahead.

If anybody&#39;s played it, Condemned 2, the whole damn thing  looked like a really bad dream. [COLOR=&#39;DimGray&#39;]But one moment in particular was when the Alcohol Demon said &quot;Ignore this Man, he&#39;s already dead.&quot; Later on when you return to sobriety you see the note in the elevator that says &quot;Memorial Services will be held for Agents Pennington and Miller [Officers killed in the dream]&quot;. The whole level creeped the shit out of me and that part blew my mind despite being relatively unspectacular. Apparently you should take the voices in your head literally.</description>

            <p>I always will remember the downstairs area in Bioshock filled with water and manicans there was some item you need in the corner and right after you grab it you turn arround and go "hey werent those guys all standing in differ…Oh Crap!!</p>
<p>Or the rare but freaky moment in Wolfenstine 3D where you turn the corner in a tight hallway only to be yelled at in german and shot at</p>

            <p>Also Fear 1 was creepy.</p>
<p>Only a few parts in Dead Space really made me jump.</p>
<p>Like when one monster broke out of the glass (I think it was a baby) and latched on to this scientist’s face.</p>

            <p>I played the original Residence Evil for gamecube, that was pretty creepy. But the effect was ruined when the girl fell on the ground and started shaking violently, my dad happened to be drunk that night, and as she was shaking on the ground he started laughing and said “Hey Zeke Look!! Shes having an orgasm” where as that point i bursted out laughing too, because i couldn’t believe my dad had just said that</p>

            <p>The only game that can scare me on following playthroughs is Condemned.  The intelligent AI, coupled with their ability to hide behind walls and shit, allows them to vanish and reappear when you turn your back.</p>

            <p>Regenerators and iron maidens from resident evil 4 were the scariest thing in the game. One time I trapped an iron maiden behind a gate and was like heh these guys aren’t so bad… then the gate opened on its own :FFFUUU:.</p>
<p>The worst thing was their breathing, knowing they were near by, but not sure where  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> .</p>

            <p>The first time I ever really jumped was playing F.E.A.R. and one of the ‘visions’ has you in a hospital corridor which fills with blood, and then it cuts to you in a swimming pool, made me scared of water for the rest of the game. However, there were NO attacks related to water for either near to the end or even until towards the end of the first expansion (can’t remember which), and so I was starting to get over the fear of water. Then. one of the demons came out of the ground under water (in a cave bit), and I didn’t see it until it was dragging me down and killing me. :[</p>
<p>However, Call of Cthulhu is by far the creepiest and spookiest and most atmospheric game I’ve played as a whole, especially the parts where you start to go insane and lose control of the character while being chased by some monster, knowing you’re likely to die unless he comes back to normal for a bit!</p>

            <p>Bioshock was probably the first proper dark game I played, and that was freaky to see things walking in the shadows. I got used to it after a few hours though.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Doom 3. That was actually the first dark game I played.</p>

            <p>Resi 4 really got me on several different levels.<br>
The first time you hear the roar of that chainsaw and realize that Dr. Sackhead isn’t going to go down with a few gunshots scared the shit outta me. The dude is constantly five feet behind you and you have a grand total of three seconds to unload everything you have into his face before he takes your goddamn head off.</p>
<p>Also, on the island in the kitchen when some guy bursts out of a goddamn oven and tries to throttle you. What was he doing in there?</p>
<p>Finally, I’d have to say the Regenerators scared me the most. Just the creepy way they walked towards you going “AHEEHEGHHEREGHAAAHGEEAHHEEAAGGAHHGRAHGGARAAHGREEEHEEE” with there breath made me want to curl into a little ball and never ever get up.</p>

<p>No one has mentioned the original Manhunt yet. That entire game is fucked up.</p>

<p>QFT, about the fucked up part. It didn’t have many scary  parts but the one part (It was a very intense game though) that did genuinely scare me was Piggsy, when you first enter his lair, how it’s all dark and grainy, really run down and dilapidated. Also the fact that the director keeps a fat naked man that wears a severed pigs head in his attic, was pretty messed up too. Oh, and also that chainsaw.</p>

            <p>The Darkness.</p>
<p>As horrible as the game was, it had the moment that scared me the most in gaming.</p>
<p>I got bored after a while and went down into one of the subway tunnels. The train never came on that track, so I decided to walk down the tracks as far as I could go. The screen gradually starts getting darker, and darker, until you can’t see a damn thing.</p>
<p>The titular ‘Darkness’ warns you that only death awaits you here, and after a moment of silence, screams ‘Now!’ The headlights of a subway car flash on in front of you, and the sound of screaming brakes and a train horn blast at you just before it hits you and kills you.</p>
<p>I have never jumped that bad over a videogame since then.</p>
