            <p>It worked fine for me after updating my video drivers.  I’m gonna be honest here, I did update my video driver then not reboot, which is why it ran like shit, but after rebooting it was great.  It loads textures slightly better now with my new processor and patches than it did before patches with the many tweaks.</p>
<p>I’d be interested in Epic’s new game if it carried forward the spirit of run n gun, and had some nice multiplayer.</p>

            <p>Didn’t Epic say that they were done with the Unreal franchise for good?</p>
<p>Anyways, if it’s not Unreal I’m not interested. If it is Unreal, I’ll get it, whatever it is, no questions asked and no reviews read. UT3 was kinda carp to the general populous, but I still enjoy it. They could do to go with a little less… Artistic art approach though. I mean, the series is “Unreal” after all, but dudes with arms the size of tree trunks and chicks all fighting in 15 inch heels? Overboard, bros.</p>

<p>Honestly he probably only said that because microsoft told him to.  Its easier than saying Microsoft doesn’t want to let us.</p>
<p>Porting from Xbox to PC is one of the easiest ports around and even with loads of piracy it’d still be commercially viable so I just don’t see the logic in his statement.</p>

            <p>I’m decent at sniping against AI, but I’ve always been horrible doing it against players.  It’s probably that it’s easy to predict what an AI is going to do compared to a player, especially in GoW how they just sit in one place for forever, just wait for their head to pop up.</p>

</aside>
<p>They delayed them, at least for the first game.  The first DLC was free, because Discovery Channel paid for it to promote Future Weapons, while the other(s?) originally cost MSP, but were later made free.  IIRC, the complete DLC pack for GoW2 is dirt cheap now, too lazy to look up the price.</p>

<p>The problem with Gears of War, IMO, is the community.  I’d probably actually play the different MP modes if the community hadn’t been such assholes to everyone ever.  Plus rolling + shotgunning.  I never took the time to get good at this, so it makes it a huge pain to play any of the three in anything other than coop.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Agreed, the community can be assholes. Best to find friends to play with instead. And my favorite way to deal with shotgun rollers is to pre-empt them. From across the map, with a active-reloaded Longshot bullet to the face. Or catch them from their blind side and chainsaw them.</p>

<p>The problem with Gears of War, IMO, is the community.  I’d probably actually play the different MP modes if the community hadn’t been such assholes to everyone ever.  Plus rolling + shotgunning.  I never took the time to get good at this, so it makes it a huge pain to play any of the three in anything other than coop.</p>

<p>It’s my understanding that GoW is published Microsoft.  They have little say in what platforms it gets released on.</p>

            <p>The Gears series is the last thing I want to see on PC. It’s a game made to keep monkeys occupied instead of throwing feces on each other.</p>

            <p>Games these days all seem to go overboard with the post processing effects.</p>

            <p>I agree. One of the things I hated about UT3 was how every surface seemed to have bump mapping, but it seemed the bump maps were mostly the same texture.</p>
<p>In a lot of places, up close bricks look like glass. Aside from that, the post-processing shaders and color grading were complete overkill. If you didn’t lower the post processing settings in UT3 it looked like everything had a blue glow.</p>

            <p>I want something that heavily relies on craftful texture work and very limited use of fancy shaders and bump maps.</p>
