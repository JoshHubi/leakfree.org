    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/get-possessed-by-a-headcrab/10274</link>
    <description>so hello, i&#39;m new to the forums and i wanted to thank the devs for the great work and all that, but this is a question that really is bothering me...

so you get an achievement when you get killed by a headcrab, can&#39;t remember the name but the description says: &quot;get possessed by a headcrab&quot; but after i&#39;m dead nothing happens... so my question is :can you really  get possessed by an headcrab?</description>

            <p>It’s foreshadowing for the planned spin-off: Black Mesa:  The Headcrab Chronicles.  Valve and Gearbox have already covered the story from the perspective of Gordon Freeman, Adrian Shepard, and Barney Calhoun.  That leaves a huge opening for the Black Mesa team to tell the story from the unique perspective of those lovable scamps we know as headcrabs.</p>
<p>You are Hedd Krabb, a middle class headcrab whose comfortable world is rocked when a resonance cascade teleports him to another dimension.  You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll attach yourself to a scientist’s neck and shamble around at 1 mph while moaning.  Black Mesa:  The Headcrab Chronicles.  Coming to your PC September 2024</p>

            <p>No it’s a joke. You just have to die by a headcrab to get an achievement. It’s a play on the game idea that when other scientists die, they get possessed and turn into Zombies. When you die, you just reload.</p>
