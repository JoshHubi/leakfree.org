    <title>mp_fraglimit with team deathmatch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mp-fraglimit-with-team-deathmatch/14177</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to setup team deathmatch on my Black Mesa server and was wondering how to change the frag limit to a higher value. At the moment it&#39;s 50, but that limit is easily reached after a few minutes. When I edit the mp_fraplimit value in server.cfg it does not change the value in game, even though it works for deathmatch.

Thanks.</description>
