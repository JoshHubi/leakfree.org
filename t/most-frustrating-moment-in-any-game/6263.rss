    <description>You are sitting there, growling the same words over and over again, &quot;This is bullshit, [FONT=&#39;Palatino Linotype&#39;]F[/FONT]ucking bullshit.

You want to throw your controller at the screen, yet don&#39;t because you want to feel the satisfaction of beating it.

You try and try, and improvise, swear, try, try, swear, hit something, improvise, and try again. :&#39;(</description>

            <p>For me, Far Cry’s later stages with rocketlauncher armed trigens were pretty frustrating.<br>
And Far Cry 2 takes the award for the most annoying, worst game I ever played. Don’t even get me started about infinitely respawning enemies, jamming guns and enemies with telescopic eyes that can spot you from a mile away hiding in a bush at night.<br>
But honestly, the most difficult game I ever completed and enjoyed was the first Manhunt for PC, on my first run through. That’s because I didn’t know that the guns have auto-aiming (just like on PS2), and I tried to aim manually, like in a GTA, which always resulted in death. If you haven’t played Manhunt, I highly reccomend it. It’s one hell of a hardcore difficult game. But totally worth every minute of it.</p>

            <p>General Knoxx in the secret armory DLC for borderlands. That boss just doesn’t die. Get him down to half health then he releases medics then gets full health again. Then you have to try and kill him, medics and other giant mech things before he releases more medics. WHY DID GEARBOX THINK THIS WAS FUN!? Though the reward is worth it.</p>

<p>I feel your pain! That was a bitch of a dungeon, and having to resort to walk-throughs was NO HELP at all.</p>
