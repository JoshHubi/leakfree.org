    <title>Getting MASSIVE amounts of Failed login attempts</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/getting-massive-amounts-of-failed-login-attempts/11777</link>
    <description>Obviously its not me. I just logged in to change my password. but every 15 mins or so. I get an email stating (with the same IP address EVERY TIME. and i do not know this IP address) 

&quot;Someone has tried to log into your account on Black Mesa: Community Forums with an incorrect password at least 5 times. This person has been prevented from attempting to login to your account for the next 15 minutes.&quot;

I left out the Ip addressed used but I do not know who it is. 


Honestly. Who wants to steal a Forum account?</description>

<p>I don’t know what the problem is here, but I do know that the IP address is your IP address. So, the log-in attempts are coming from your IP - maybe someone you live with trying to guess your password or something.</p>

            <p>maybe someone really wants to use your user name</p>
<p>Maybe change emails so it doesn’t clog your main inbox. This has never happened to me except when the guy who sold me his steam account was trying to steal it back from me.</p>

            <p>Ironically, he got banned because of a short outburst of being a fuckass and not because he wouldn’t stop bragging about his tetanus dick.</p>
<p>The shit he drew was weird, but god damn his linework was so precise. I do envy that.</p>
