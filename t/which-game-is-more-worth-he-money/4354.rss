            <p>If you buy CS: S in the store, the box comes with Day of Defeat: Source as well. Definitely well worth the money, since DoD is one of the most overlooked games ever and it ROCKS!</p>

            <p>CS: S is exactly the same to CS. Only with better graphics and in a newer engine (source).<br>
Definitely worth your money, when I got it, it was on offer (10 bucks) but still I think it’s worth 20 dollars. There are lots of mods out there (zombie mod being my favourite) and you will find your self coming back again and again to the game for a quick match.</p>
<p>If you aren’t convinced other games I recommend you are Team Fortress 2 or call of duty 4 (not modern warfare 2).</p>

<p>If you have Gmod, then get CS: S as lots of props and textures from it are used.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think most of them you get anyway.</p>
<p>But in my opinion CS: S is the one to get. CS was good, but is a bit old now. I played it the other day, and realised how dated it felt.</p>
<p>Anyway, CS taught me how to play FPS so it deserves credit. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>…if one of your other choices though is MW2 or something… stick with CSS</p>
