    <title>Collision Radio - Daydreams [A Musical Experiment]</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/collision-radio-daydreams-a-musical-experiment/1660</link>
    <description>Ok guys, this is a first of many chapters in my 5.1 musical experiment.
So as you know you need a 5.1 speaker setup for this music to play to it&#39;s full extent, if you don&#39;t you will only hear 2 of the 6 audio tracks in each of the songs.

Each song is an uncompressed wav as there is no other ready medium for 5.1 to be stored and played by a normal media player.

(Please note, I have only played this song in WMP as a test, I do not know if iTunes or VLC support 5.1 audio).

But without further talk, I present &#39;Daydreams&#39; a series of songs produced using Acid Pro 7 and mixed in real Dolby Pro 5.1 at 24bit (Rendered to 16bit for listening purposes) at 48K.

The first song Chapter I or also can be called &#39;Impulse&#39; as was the code name I gave the song in production is my first real attempt at a 5.1 mixed song, each song in this series I hope to try something different genre wise while still keeping my signature style.

So please enjoy.

            <p>It wouldn’t be downmixed, it would be cutting out the center, rear and LFE channels.</p>
<p>So what you listened to would have no subbass effects, no reverb, no sweaping effects.</p>
<p>Most of them are kinda the main parts of the song.</p>

            <p>I listened to it and it sounded too calm, you have to add some beat to your songs but at the same time make it less repetitive.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I only have stereo, but I’m pretty sure it was downmixed to 2 channels by VLC.</p>

<p>If you want people to listen to your music, encode it to a streamable format.  The tradeoff in quality between a high bitrate mp3 and an uncompressed 5.1 wav is simply not worth it on the vast majority of people’s stereo systems. I.e. most of your listeners won’t bother downloading the larger file as they wouldn’t be able to notice an audible difference between your massive file and a 5mb mp3.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for the comment Mr I Missed the entire reason this song was made.</p>
<p>Why do you even post, everything you do post is retarded as fuck.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a streamable 5.1 format, WAV is the only medium that 5.1 can be rendered to and play in conventional media players.</p>
<p>The song was meant for people who actually live in this century and have 5.1 systems in thier house.</p>
<p>Also there is a MASSIVE audible difference between MP3 and WAV considering on average most MP3 conversion will cut out 80% of the original file.</p>
<p>It is also a large due to the fact it is a 6 CHANNEL audio file rather then the tradition 2 channel.</p>
<p>Mattemuse, stop posting, in fact, don’t ever post in one of my threads ever again.</p>

            <p>First of all, wanna suggest you to make DAYDREAMS on your cover more opaque. i understand that you wanted to give it an artistic touch, but it should be slightly less transparent.</p>
<p>Good thing I have Bose Lifestyle 5.1 in my room. I’ll check out the music when I’ll have some time, because I need to record an audio DVD for that matter.<br>
Take care.</p>

<p>(Please note, I have only played this song in WMP as a test, I do not know if iTunes or VLC support 5.1 audio).</p>
<p>But without further talk, I present ‘Daydreams’ a series of songs produced using Acid Pro 7 and mixed in real Dolby Pro 5.1 at 24bit (Rendered to 16bit for listening purposes) at 48K.</p>
<p>The first song Chapter I or also can be called ‘Impulse’ as was the code name I gave the song in production is my first real attempt at a 5.1 mixed song, each song in this series I hope to try something different genre wise while still keeping my signature style.</p>
<p>So please enjoy.</p>
