    <description>Welp, Sony got hacked again. Over the last weekend actually.

It may surprise some, then, that after all of the media attention surrounding this major breach of security, that the group called “Lulzsec” is claiming to have attacked the servers yet again and say that they have walked away with unencrypted security information. According to examples of their hacking as provided on Twitter (when challenged for proof of their claims) it looks as though they did indeed hack Sony networks and web sites, including Sony Music Belgium, Sony Music Netherlands and Sony Pictures. Lulzsec wrote, on the site of Pastebin, the following:
“We recently broke into SonyPictures.com and compromised over 1,000,000 users’ personal information, including passwords, email addresses, home addresses, dates of birth and all Sony opt-in data associated with their accounts. Among other things, we also compromised all admin details of Sony Pictures (including passwords) along with 75,000 ‘music codes’ and 3.5 million ‘music coupons’.”

If I were you I&#39;d steer clear of them and de-activate your accounts... you think they&#39;d learn their lesson from the first series of attacks.

Discuss. It&#39;s old news, I know. I didn&#39;t spot a thread though.</description>

            <p>“Don’t shoot the messenger”</p>
<p>It’s a false sense of security if no-one tries to attack your data infrastructure.</p>
<p>Hackers are only showing the world that many companies or organizations, for which security of data should be the top priority, are doing a poor job protecting it. It may seem bad when these hackers steal your data, but it might be much worse – these hackers at least boast about it, so you KNOW something happened and can take action. If it was foreign hackers who would silently steal all your money using stolen credit card data, what would you do?</p>
<p>It’s possible to make systems secure. But companies nowadays focus more on fancy Flash animations on their webpages, than on data security. It all has to be cool and shiny and facebook-connected and whatnot, but security is their last concern.</p>
<p>VALVe recently introduced SteamGuard – a system where you cannot logon to steam from a new computer unless you also have access to your e-mail. Do you think others will learn and copy this system? No, they are too proud to admit someone else is doing it right.</p>
