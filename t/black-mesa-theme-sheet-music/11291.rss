    <title>Black Mesa Theme Sheet Music</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-theme-sheet-music/11291</link>
    <description>For those of you looking for sheet music to the theme, look no further. After hours of searching the internet to no avail, I finally took it upon myself to transcribe the theme in Finale. Let me know if there are any problems with it, but I&#39;m going to attach it here for everyone to download. All credit goes to the wonderful Joel Nielsen who provided us with the spectacular soundtrack to Black Mesa. I simply transcribed it. ENJOY!

*Edit
There is one mistake I made. In measure 6 there should be an F in the bass NOT the A flat that is written, my bad!

            <p>If you need it - you can download the free Finale Viewer app here:</p>
<p><a href="https://az18268.vo.msecnd.net/applications/Reader/2011/FinReaderWin.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://az18268.vo.msecnd.net/applications/Reader/2011/FinReaderWin.exe</a></p>
<p>This allows you to print the sheet &amp; also have your PC ‘play thru’ the written notes to help you learn it.</p>
<p>Install the program, then FILE - IMPORT the musicXML file, posted by Slytax24 above.<br>
(I had a few errors about ‘distance’ on the xml import, but just click thru them, it doesn’t affect the sheet music)</p>
<p>If you play it it thru with the viewer, I found that a speed of about 80bpm sounded about right (the player defaults to 120!)</p>
<p>Slytax points out a minor mistake in the Bass in bar 6 - it should read the same as the very last bar.<br>
(and if you are <em>really</em> picky you can open up the XML file in something like Notepad++ and edit line 937 to change the Aflat to a F, and remove the &lt;alter -1&gt; tags above &amp; below to change it to a proper F whole note before you import &amp; print it)</p>
<p>Big Thanks to Slytax - I searched the web for hours for this sheet - it doesn’t exist!</p>
