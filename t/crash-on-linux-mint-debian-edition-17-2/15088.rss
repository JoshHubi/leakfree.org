    <title>Crash on Linux Mint Debian Edition 17.2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-on-linux-mint-debian-edition-17-2/15088</link>
    <description>Crashes consistently right here (see attached screenshot).  Most recent 2 crashes were &quot;IVP failed&quot; as seen here, but the first one was a different error altogether (sorry, didn&#39;t get the snapshot).  Can&#39;t find the dumps.  Did root search (find / -iname *dmp | grep -i steam and find / -iname crash_bms* | grep -i steam) but got no hits.  Are dumps available from Linux install, and where?  Crash seemed to hang and needed to be sent SIGKILL, so perhaps dumps didn&#39;t get written out.

Will try to get the other error message and upload screenshot of that as well in case it is helpful.

Original screenshot was 2560x1080, but too large to upload it seems (although only 3.3MB).

Great game so far, however.

            <p>Correction, crashes not consistent.  Couldn’t get it to happen a fourth time.</p>
