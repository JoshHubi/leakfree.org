    <description>Who else thinks it&#39;d be cool to have Sven Co-op or another co-op mod ported to the Source engine for Black Mesa? Same as Sven Co-op is now, but with the BM maps and custom maps.</description>

<p>Pretty much, but it’s not directly tied to Sven Coop in any way.  SC dropped their development for a source version a LONG time ago to focus more on improving what was already released.</p>
<p>I’m kind of curious as to what they did (if anything) with what they had developed up to that point - assuming they had anything tangible worked out…</p>

            <p>There are mods like synergy, obsidian conflict, they can mount other games (even half-life source). Maybe there will be a port of BM to obsidian/synergy</p>

            <p>They’re not going to release the source code for the mod, so you can’t implement co-op. They might add basic support for it for custom maps, but that’s wishful thinking at this point.<br>
Also, the Sven Co-op team has no plans to port to Source, they’re continuing to work on the GoldSource version.</p>

<p>But that will probably be months from now. It’d be nice to have something close to that in the meantime, in my opinion. I’m just thinking out loud here.</p>
