    <title>Can&#39;t jump very well in BM apparently</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cant-jump-very-well-in-bm-apparently/10840</link>
    <description>Have had a lot of trouble attempting jumps in BM.   Don&#39;t know if there is some sort of keyboard mapping issue,   or something else.    It should not be as difficult as it is for me.   Press &#39;w&#39; and then &#39;space&#39; should let me jump forward,
yet (Freeman)  is not able to make even the simplest jumps.   Very frustrating.</description>

<p>We have had some of these “…can’t jump…” threads already. <span class="bbcode-b">&lt;- No offence!</span></p>
<p>Have you tried crouch jumping (Ctrl + Spacebar) or using SHIFT to sprint while jumping?</p>
