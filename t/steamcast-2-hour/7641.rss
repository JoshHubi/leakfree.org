Unfortunately, Steamcast is a bit behind on episodes but you can [url=&#39;https://www.twitch.tv/steamcast/b/291991707&#39;]listen on the unedited stream. ( skip to 14m )[/url]

Welcome to the official Steamcast website. Steamcast is a fan-made podcast, generally recorded on a weekly basis every Sunday, that hosts a wide range of gaming related topics. Contrary to its name, the podcast does not focus strictly on Valve or Steam related topics but aims to cover as much of the entire gaming industry as possible including gaming digital distribution, major gaming press conferences, and other relevant news. As a community-founded podcast, Steamcast places high importance on community participation. Members of the community are welcome to join the hosts and share their thoughts and opinions on specific topics. This gives the community — everyday gamers — the opportunity to voice their opinions and concerns.....................

            <p>That was a great interview. It really ups the feeling that BM is “coming”, even if that might not particularly be the case just yet. IMO one interview like this every once in a while is more worth it than constant updates every day, because it resparks my interest, whereas a constant thing just makes me loose interest after a while.</p>

            <p>The funny thing is that most of the haters who care enough to show up to give a complaining comment only do so because they still have a subscription for BlackMesaSourceMedia.<br>
You’d have to be quite stupid not to see the irony in this.</p>

            <p>Just ignore them, everyone knows that most of the comments are made by impatient underage 12 year old douchebags anyway.</p>

            <p>This conversation is hyping me just seeing another dev that hardly comes on here. Also, new content you say? Out there? I can scarcely contain my excitement for what that might mean. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, the new video comments, seriously pissing me off. Little shits can’t appreciate anything.</p>

            <p>I did the push but the work was all from kevin.</p>
<p>I did not push it for the hype.<br>
I pushed because the loyal fans asked for it and you guys deserve it for sticking around.</p>
