    <description>It is rude.  It isn&#39;t funny or clever. It is just rude.  Stealing something that belongs to someone else doesn&#39;t make you cool, it only makes you someone with too much time on your hands. 

I liken an identity thief to a domain squatter.

You know who you are and it is not funny or appreciated.

That is just my personal opinion.</description>

            <p>Bloody hell, that spawned a big discussion.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Personally, I think he deserved every bit of what he got, but likely I’m not good enough with words to sufficiently explain why. He deserved it one for getting into that stuff in the first place, and two for not thinking through the basics. I mean, msn? :jizz:<br>

<blockquote>
<p>So what you’re trying to tell us bascially, is instead of calling a theft a crime, we should behave like a bunch of kids and steal what some one tried to steal from us?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think a lot of people misunderstand what brOkenrabbit actually did to poor little shit-for-brains Greg. He didn’t ‘steal’ his account as everyone seems to think… he gave it back to him a few days later.</p>
<p>What he <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> do, and quite rightly so, was to humiliate the wannabe thief throughout the entire internet community.</p>
<p>Before the thread was finally closed, brOkenrabbit’s post in the Fururemark General Discussion Forum had 1,247,372 views, plus thousands of views in countless forums all around the world… so a <span class="bbcode-i">lot</span> of people, (and I’m sure that included Valve), got to know about Greg’s failed hijacking attempt.</p>
<p>Even now, a Google search for ‘Greg_ValveOLS’ still brings up 976 results - so his misery continues to this day.</p>
<p>When I origionally posted this ‘conversation’ on the BM Forum a couple of years ago, I was trawling through the various websites to follow people’s reactions as the saga was unfolding… and the vast, vast majority thought it was hilarious and that Greg had got exactly what he deserved.</p>
<p>Apart from a few addled-brained do-gooders who felt sorry for poor little 13-year old Greg, because that bad brOkenrabbit person had actually <span class="bbcode-i">lied</span> to him and had taken his hard-earned account, most of the negative reaction seemed to be from those who were really annoyed and pissed-off - not by anything that brOkenrabbit had done - but only because the would-be hijacker had been caught out.</p>
<p>To get back to your original point… no, I don’t think that we should ‘steal what someone tried to steal from us’. If someone stole, or tried to steal from me, I would have both their hands amputated!</p>
<p>It’s very difficult to steal, (or use a keyboard), with stumps… particularly if the hands are removed from the shoulder joint!</p>

<p>It’s not acting like a bunch of kids, it’s acting like a misbehaving child being punished by an adult who has come up with a simple, effective, and memorable punishment that is not so severe that it has any debilitating consequences on their future development.</p>

<p>Just because it was done, doesn’t mean it is right in the first place. Stealing should never have a defense especially in a democratic society.</p>
<p>Simply put, if it isn’t yours, don’t take it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Stealing already is a defense that is used in a democratic society, it’s called fines. When you steal something or even attempt theft, you can be jailed or fined X number of dollars, hence you can have your money stolen from you. Just because it’s the government doesn’t mean that they aren’t taking something that doesn’t belong to them.<br>
By your logic, what would have been “right” would have been to contact valve and report him, possibly file legal charges against him, opening up not only the kid to a criminal record but also his parents to fines over whatever damages the kid may have occurred (just because the kid was stupid doesn’t mean he might not have already been successful using that method to scam someone who simply happened to be more gullible)<br>
This method simply gave the kid a taste of his own medicine along with a strong dose of humility. If more people solved problems this way, maybe a trend of personal responsibility could actually be started instead of constantly resorting to lawyers and lawsuits.</p>

<p>The forums went down and all names/accounts got wiped out.  So <span class="bbcode-b">all </span>of us have had to re-register our names again.  However SOMEONE has been registering names / accounts to the forums that clearly do not belong to them.  I am sure they are doing it as a joke or prank or something.  For all I know it is Kester being his adorable abnoxious self, (just a guess is all) but I just had to say that I personally dont think this particular prank is funny.</p>
<p>Any other implication I may have inadvertently implied was not intended.</p>

</aside>
<p>that’s what I was assuming, but since it wasn’t directly said, I wasn’t sure if this was one of those “don’t talk about it and give more people ideas to cause trouble” situations.<br>
One thing I see coming up is that with the some 50000 people that had registered in the previous forums, a lot of people may have not been able to log in under a preferred account name and some may use the reset to grab that before it gets taken again. It’s hard to say what should be done in cases like that, at least as long as they aren’t actually trying to pretend to be the person who originally had the name they grabbed.</p>

<p>I must disagree with siggs. Hacking someone’s account is cruel, and since the games have been payed for on a steam account, its also a crime. Why people go so far for a few simple games is beyond me. I must admit, Greg_ValveOLS worked hard for his steam account and games. br0kenrabbit could have just diffused the situation but instead he used the kid for his own means.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, when you put it that way…<br>
I think we can all agree that trying to get someone else’s account is wrong, but you have to admit, when they get beaten by their intended target it’s a bit amusing.</p>

            <p>That’s actually pretty good, although, to be fair, that’s a retaliation steal. What’s happening here is just retarded.</p>

As an employee, I know that Valve employees will NEVER contact users over MSN. I also know a valve employee will NEVER ask a user for his/her username and password.</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
I’m putting a temporary hold on your Steam account.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>

Have you read the ToS?</p>

<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>

<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
I need some information from you if you want me to unlock you account. I’m going to write you up but I will only suspend you account for three days, since this is your first infraction, okay?</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
k</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
First, what is the name the account is registered to. Not the user name, the persons real name who created the account. This is for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Greg_ValveOLS says:<br>
xxxxx xxxxxxx</p>
<p>br0kenrabbit says:<br>
