    <title>Coordinates system for air strikes is messed up.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/coordinates-system-for-air-strikes-is-messed-up/11580</link>
    <description>When I went to use the console on the tower to plot air strikes, the cross hairs stayed in the center and only flickered occasionally to other places on the map when I moved there.  The red dots were VERY hard to place properly and they too flickered or didn&#39;t show up.

Please make this easier to use by having the cross-hairs follow the center of the screen and show the red dot where you click.  That was the hardest part of the game and shouldn&#39;t be.

Other than that, most everything worked or had a work around.  It was a good game, but a major kick in the nads when you were about to enter Xen and the game ends on you.  You guys pitched some of the best parts of the game by doing that.  Hopefully there will be a new module to finish it off.  Thanks for building Black Mesa!  =)  Hopefully this review/bug report helps.  If you need more info, let me know.  I don&#39;t have a save game at the console anymore, though.</description>

            <p>Mine did the same thing on the first playthrough - very frustrating, but eventually manageable. Many others have stated having this issue as well.</p>
<p>Playing through a second time cured this issue for some reason. It worked perfect, I was actually very impressed with how cool of a feature it was when it was working correctly. Other unrelated(?) glitches disappeared as well on subsequent playthroughs, even though my setup remained the same.  Most, if not all, of my in-game settings remained unchanged as well.  So, what caused it? More importantly, what fixed it???  I wish I could provide an answer…</p>
<p>I’m playing on an old-ish, “budget” laptop with an ATI card (one of the first lower-end Toshiba Satellites to ship with Win7 instead of Vista)… if it’s even relevant to the issue…</p>
