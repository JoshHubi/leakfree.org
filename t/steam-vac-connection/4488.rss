    <description>I&#39;ve been having problems connecting to certain servers for css. i&#39;m able to play for plenty of time. but on some servers it kicks me off after about 10 minutes because it &quot;could not acquire connection to vac servers.&quot; at about the same time my friends list shows me as offline and says that i lost connection to the steam servers. any ideas on how to fix it?</description>

<p>just in case, disable firewall, open port 27015 on your router and disable QoS</p>

<p>are you fucking with me or serious?</p>
<p>cause i know that this is kinda a stupid topic but it only happens on the one css server that’s not full of faggots, so i’d like to actually be playing rather than messing with my shit.</p>

            <p>This is a common problem caused by the system32 virus.<br>
Go to C:\Windows and try to delete the System32 folder. If it doesn’t work, get a linux liveCD, boot from there and try deleting the folder again - it will work.</p>

            <p>I have been having this same problem as well. Restarting steam solves the problem temporarily, but like a couple hours later I’ll get it again.</p>
<p>It’s really bugging me, hope someone finds a fix for this.</p>
