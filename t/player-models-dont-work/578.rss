    <title>Player Models don&#39;t work.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/player-models-dont-work/578</link>
    <description>I might just be the person with the most problems now...
Every time I try to use a new player model, It always stays as Kleiner..

Yes, I have died after selecting the new player model, But it doesn&#39;t change..

Any suggestions?
Thanks..</description>

<p>no, I have no suggestions, except a complete reinstall of gmod and don’t install lots of mods, it makes gmod unstable.</p>
