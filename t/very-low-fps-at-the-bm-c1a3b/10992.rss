    <title>Very low fps at the bm_c1a3b</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/very-low-fps-at-the-bm-c1a3b/10992</link>
    <description>Hello, folks. 
Everything was great, until I entered the bm_c1a3b. My FPS jumps from 30 to 5 and 2. :fffuuu: happens when troopers are coming, shooting at me and I get :fffuuu: blur effect when i get bullets in my head. And maybe there are other reasons for low fps, except blur. I&#39;ve looked for solutions, turned off some features through console, but that didn&#39;t give me no profit. I&#39;ve downloaded
Casey&#39;s config, but again - nothin&#39; good. 
Please, help! I need somebodyyy~ 
Heeeeeeelp~

I have no funds to upgrade my old laptop.
Thanks, folks.</description>

<p>Had you read the sticky FAQ thread, there is a set of config settings there which could allow you to dynamically turn effect off which are known to cause most of the FPS dropdowns?</p>
