<p>Clearly when your character reloads, they pull the remaining bullets out of the magazine, and put them in their pocket, then when they reload again, they pull out the previous magazine, shove the extra ones in, and keep going.</p>
<p>Or they only have 1 magazine altogether, and just keep pushing bullets into it in the split second it takes to reload in game.</p>

            <p>If games were realistic, you’d have what Battelfield 2 has, then another key you can press while in cover somewhere, that makes you spend 3 mins shifting rounds from all the partially empty mags in your dump-pouch into one… along with a several minute long sequence every loadout where you load each mag one round at a time, and clean your guns…</p>

            <p>Nice list, really. Funny it took me almost 10 seconds to get the “you can’t see ghosts” thing.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  Mortal Kombat FTW. Also interesting that Lara Croft didn’t make the list. Maybe noone did a good 'shop of that?</p>
