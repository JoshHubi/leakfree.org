    <title>What would Gordon do?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-would-gordon-do/5407</link>
    <description>Alright boys, I have a question of [COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]epic proportions.
I currently have a laptop that plays source fine, but only all all lowest settings. It&#39;s fantastic, has a webcam, great machine, BUT my brother offered to trade his amazing tower that plays source games on FULL all easily with no problem, total gaming compter, for my laptop since he plays no videogames, and is heading to college.
MY DELEMA:
I go to friends houses all of the time with my laptop and play right next to them. it&#39;s freeking bomb.
But with a tower, black mesa would run like butter.
I&#39;ll count the votes, so trolls, once your done being a dick write a [COLOR=&#39;MediumTurquoise&#39;]tower or [COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]laptop.[/SIZE]</description>

            <p>well this question is actually pretty hard to answer without getting the specifications of the tower… How about posting them?</p>

            <p>343 firemen died that day. 19 terrorists died. I think Bolteh wasn’t referring to the firemen.<br>
On the subject of the thread however, i would strongly recommend the tower.</p>

            <p>I agree. That picture was indeed inappropriate and offensive.</p>
<p>19 brave men lost their lives that day, that’s no laughing matter.</p>

<p>Totally inappropriate and quite offensive.  :what:</p>
<p>Back on topic - assuming the tower is in working order (you say it runs games fine, but as listed above - does it BSOD, blow smoke, etc.?) I’d say go with the [COLOR=‘Cyan’]tower.</p>
<p>As for someone “in their right mind” trading a tower for a laptop - if that someone doesn’t game, why have a tower in the first place?  I mean, sure, there are desktop all-in-ones that non-gamers use, but if someone is going to college and will need a PC in class/lab/dorm room, then a laptop is fine.</p>
