    <title>What is the biggest troll game ever?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-is-the-biggest-troll-game-ever/5956</link>
    <description>I nominate Perfect World International.

This game is the definition of pay to win. The makers of this game have perfected the art of microtransactions. There are people who literally sink thousands of dollars into this &quot;free-to-play&quot; MMO, and its so hard to do anything without buying from the cash shop that most people end up paying more for &quot;optional&quot; items than it would cost to just play WoW. Skill is no longer required to play, except for the skill of reading your credit card. The in-game economy is also now broken beyond repair and no one seems to care. They just stand around buying items to do nothing with. It is literally the digital version of feeding your cash into a shredder. It makes me weep for humanity. 

What do you think is the trollingest game ever?</description>

            <p>Any Call of Duty game, Team Fortress 2, and most MMORPGs. They’re just grinds that, once you get down to the core gameplay, really aren’t that fun. Well… Team Fortress 2 is kinda fun aside from the random pyros burning you to death in 2 seconds and the spies randomly ganking you and the engineers with their shielded level 3 turrets that never die and kill you in 2 seconds… BUT BESIDES THAT it’s fun game, but the unlock system is just so horrible that I feel sick when I try to play it.</p>

            <p>Are you talking about this “the game”? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_%28treasure_hunt%29" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_%28treasure_hunt%29</a></p>
<p>Anyways, here’s my pick:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>The game doesn’t troll as much as it lets its users troll. Find an unmoderated public server, where prepubescent individuals simply labeled as Griefers, can come in and destroy whatever creation you made that day. Hours of building, completely decimated in a matter of seconds. Don’t expect your stuff to last longer than a day.</p>

            <p>I didn’t even know about it until a few months ago, when some of my nieces and nephews were obsessing over it.</p>

            <p>Hm… Postal. The game is a troll, even your a troll, trolling people around the town…</p>

<p>Final Fantasy X</p>

<p>Really? I really liked FFX. It may not be the best one, but I thought it was great. Ok, I did hate Blitzball, but it wasn’t a core part of the game, so I didn’t mind. Ultimate weapons also were never necessary to get, so I didn’t mind that most were super difficult either. Those kinds of things are added for people who want the satisfaction of completing really hard challenges, and I was just interested in beating the game.</p>
<p>FFXIII, on the other hand…while I hate to leave a game unfinished, I just can’t bring myself to play any more of it. Combat is boring, couldn’t care less about most the characters (and some are truly grating…<em>cough</em> Vanille <em>cough</em>), story is pretty tired and strangely paced, upgrading weapons feels very unsatisfying as opposed to getting new ones. The music was actually still pretty good in most places, even though Nobuo didn’t write it, but unfortunately that’s about all its got going for it.</p>

<p>I would have to agree, but I’m going to add a game anyway.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy X</p>
<p>Horrible story.  Many horrible character designs.  BlitzBall.  Unlocking ultimate weapons.  And the ending. (if you cared about the story)</p>
