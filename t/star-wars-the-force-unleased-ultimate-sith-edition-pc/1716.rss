    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/star-wars-the-force-unleased-ultimate-sith-edition-pc/1716</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if anyone of you played Force Unleashed before, its a Star Wars game on consoles. I always liked the trailer and the gameplay videos of the game, but never got to play it, because i dont have any type of console system... :frowning: 
And noow it&#39;s out on PC!!! The ultimate sith edition!!
I was thinking about ordering it on amazon or something, but i dont know if its worth it, some ppl say the console version was too short, and it got boring after some time. That&#39;s why I need your help, fellow black mesa forum scientists, if you ever played the game, let me know, would you buy it on pc?(it&#39;s a whole different story, not the pc remake of the console game)</description>

            <p>There’s an easy way to see if a game is really worth your money.</p>
<p>Torrent it.</p>
<p>If you know you’ll use it in good faith, no problem. If it’s crap, the delete button is right there. If it’s worth the price tag, hit the ATM and get it. If good but not worth the money, delete and wait for price drop or used copy. Perfectly acceptable choices.</p>
<p>Or you can think and insinuate that I’m a horrible human being who by merely suggesting the option of sampling said product is committing an inexcusable crime and only deserves to have his balls cut off. [/sarcasm]</p>
<p>Your choice.</p>

            <p>Yep the KotOR series kicked ass!<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7WHHQokRGs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7WHHQokRGs</a>   This is the gameplay trailer of the upcoming The Old Republic game, you should watch it, it’s worth it! Even tho the movement of the characters suck big time IMO, I hope they fix that shit, it’s like Tanya in the Red Alert 3 game…damn that sux so much!</p>

            <p>Actually, I think I’ll spend the money on KotOR instead. I love Star Wars, and I love Mass Effect. KotOR was made by Bioware.<br>
Plus, The Force Unleashed got mediocre reviews, whereas KotOR got high praise. So…</p>

            <p>Well they say it IS a remake of the original console game…the only difference is, that it has every DLC(like the hoth map where you fight Luke etc.) ingame originally, not like the console version, where you had to download it.</p>

            <p>I hope to play the Ultimate Sith Edition for the 360. I’m a big Star Wars fan (of the original films, mind you) so this just might be cool.</p>

            <p>It is an excellent game. Storyline was REALLY good with some really interesting characters.<br>
Gameplay was excellent and captured the force perfectly. It does get a little repetitive at times, but its a hack n slash at heart so its bound to. Having the variety of force powers keeps it interesting though.<br>
I read its the same game just with all the DLC added to it. I haven’t played any of the DLC, but some of it looks really interesting. Like the mission on Hoth where you fight Luke.<br>
It is a little short. I finished it in just under 10 hours I think. Somewhere like 8.5 (on normal difficulty). DLC is probably another 2-3 hours. I borrowed it from a friend and beat it once then went into the menus and watched all the cutscenes in a row like a movie. lol. I haven’t had a major urge to want to replay it though. Great game, little replay value other than for the story.<br>
I would recommend it as a perfect rental… but as far as I know you can’t rent for PC.</p>
<p>Up to you on the buy. You can always wait and get it when the price drops. Which is what I do for games that are short with low replay value unless I absolutely have to have it. Which if you’re a die hard Star Wars fan you might want to get it right away cause it is an awesome game while it lasts.</p>
