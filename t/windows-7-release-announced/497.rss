October 22 for store shelves.  Soon there will be an option to upgrade for people that are buying new pc&#39;s.

I think Vista users should get a discounted price as MS basically screwed us all.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m very happy with Windows 7, and I full-on think it’s what Windows Vista should have always been, and more.  Don’t even get me started on why Vista is better than XP, mostly because they’re all the same as has already been enumerated.  7 just takes all the “new stuff” in Vista and refines it, cleans it, and speeds it up.  All around.  While I personally hope for Linux to succeed in the future, Windows 7 is the great Microsoft OS.  I can only hope it’s what MS has been aiming for all these years since XP.</p>

            <p>Interesting Sersoft.  I haven’t had a single problem with Vista EVER.  I have had tons of problems with XP and I think it is total crap.</p>
<p>I should say I haven’t had any problems on my machines.  I’ve seen other people’s vista machines that ran like garbage, but it’s been smooth sailing for me.</p>

            <p>Not a single problem on XP, burns anything, and backups anything.</p>
<p>I can put a PS2 dvd and save it to .nrg and then play it on pcsx2 without the dvd, or I can burn a DVD that plays on standard DVD players (I can design the menus and everything), I don’t use anything else.</p>
<p>I’ve had numerous issues with nero 8. Even on Vista.</p>
<p>Anyway watch what you say level, it’s not very nice to say that someone deserves to have computer issues if you’ve never even tried to understand my point.</p>

</aside>
<p>64 vista has never failed me, because you can install programs in the 32 bit architecture (or running in 32 bit mode or something, I don’t know the technicals behind it). So if something isn’t compatible, it installs itself into 32 bit mode automatically and it works fine.</p>
<p>Not a single program I’ve downloaded that doesn’t work. Only issue I’ve seen is unraring in 32 bit then transferring the files into 64 bit didn’t work for me a couple times.</p>

<p>Wasn’t there something like a 5 year gap between XP and Vista? And then they’re only coming out with Windows 7 so soon because people don’t know how to upgrade their hardware.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Vista on my desktop for almost 2 years now and its great. Although I will be going to W7 once its out, because it runs so well on my netbook and looks great in terms of looks and features.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it’s a similar thing happening with 2000-XP and now Vista-7.</p>
<p>Vista has been taking a lot of shit, and deserved almost all of it when first released. Not much wrong with it now (besides some unneeded use of RAM, which is easily solved by exploiting the 64-bit qualities of Vista) besides the fact that it’s simply unpopular. Releasing it under a new name will simply sell better than making more updates to fix Vista (for free for original Vista users).</p>

            <p>Wasn’t there something like a 5 year gap between XP and Vista? And then they’re only coming out with Windows 7 so soon because people don’t know how to upgrade their hardware.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Vista on my desktop for almost 2 years now and its great. Although I will be going to W7 once its out, because it runs so well on my netbook and looks great in terms of looks and features.</p>

<p>Yeah I remember that, all the games lagged on XP and some didn’t even work right, and software wasn’t compatible, after a few years though, it became the best.</p>
<p>If Microsoft stopped making a new OS every 2 years and lets windows 7 be the only OS for a few years, people are gonna get used to it just like XP.</p>

            <p>I use Vista, it isn’t the greatest OS ever, but it isn’t bad at all. UAC isn’t as bitchy when configured, just right click your C:\ drive and change the permissions so you don’t get yelled at whenever you just freaking want to rename one folder.</p>
<p>Definitely going to upgrade to 7 though. Might get the RC if I can clone my disk onto a bigger drive. 40gig laptop drives run out of space quickly when you have steam, windows, and suse.</p>

            <p>So Sersoft, basically, you hate Vista because it isn’t XP, because that’s that’s the point you’re proving here.</p>
<p>Solid argument.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">Hybrid sleep - if it’s not compatible, just turn off s3 or s4, whichever doesn’t work. No feature degradation.</span></p>
<p>but it’s something the motherboard manufacturers should work on, not the OS makers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Per-app volume management - if you don’t want it, don’t use it. How can it be annoying?</span></p>
<p>you can’t turn it off, at least I didn’t find the old XP menu anywhere, I just want the old sndvol32.exe from XP that I can use to control wave/master/midi/linein and choose my recording source (line in/stereo mix/mic)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Desktop gadgets - actually pretty handy IMO, you need to cast about for the right ones though. Having a decent CPU meter onscreen at all times, for example, is a godsend for people like me.</span></p>
<p>I don’t use performance meters, except for temperature, which fits in the taskbar.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Address Space Randomisation - I don’t think you understand how it works. If it uses any more RAM than before, then it’s an insignificant amount. Also, most other OSes do this to a greater or lesser extent.</span></p>
<p>I don’t think I need to understand, XP works better, even without it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">UAC, agreed, it’s annoying, but again, if you don’t like it then just turn it off and it’s the same as XP. Also, other OSes do this kind of thing too.</span></p>
<p>Turning it off defeats the purpose, UAC should not exist, spyware could be blocked by different, less annoying ways.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Massively improved start menu - I honestly can’t see why, but even if you don’t like it, just switch back to the Classic menu.</span></p>
<p>that defeats the purpose, why not just use the same start menu for everyone and make it fully customizable?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Tighter search integration - what kind of idiot stores his porn in an indexed location? In fact, what kind of idiot stores porn? Isn’t that what the Internet is for?<br>
</span><br>
My internet doesn’t always work, and I don’t want to waste bandwidth on redownloading porn</p>
<p>I just don’t like changes, I love how easy to use XP is because I’m used to it, new features just confuse me.</p>
