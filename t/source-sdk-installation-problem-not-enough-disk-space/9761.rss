    <title>source SDK installation problem &quot;not enough disk space&quot;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-installation-problem-not-enough-disk-space/9761</link>
    <description>bullshit. my steam is on my J drive, a 1T portable hard drive. i have 746GB left of free space, yet when i try to install source SDK, i get &quot;not enough disk space&quot;?

this is the second issue i&#39;ve encountered when it comes to steam and it&#39;s location, the first being that i cannot launch Dayz via steam because it seemingly cant find steam as it tells me, but those are the only 2 issues i have had with anything source/steam related.

also if this will help anyone fix my problem, my steam is installed directly on my J drive, not in a folder in my J drive. could this be the problem (for source SDK and Dayz)? i&#39;ve been thinking it is, but i&#39;m scared to re-install because i&#39;m afraid that i&#39;ll have to install my games ALL OVER AGAIN.... and i dont want to do that.

and plus.... I WANNA PLAY BMS! i have it installed, i just need to install SDK for it to work, and i cant install SDK :/

help?</description>

            <p>^ Also that. Most (nearly all) USB drives and portable hard drives are formatted with FAT as opposed to NTFS, as NTFS is Microsoft proprietary, and as such, will not work with Crapple software, such as Mac OSX.</p>

            <p>What file system is the portable HDD using?</p>
<p>That’s a common error message when you try to copy a file larger than 4Gb to a fat32 filesystem.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, it is formatted in fat32, you should be able to get away with copying off the data, reformatting in NTFS, and copying your data back.</p>

            <p>Steam will not allow you to install it on a portable harddrive. Are you <span class="bbcode-u">absolutely</span> certain that your game folders (steamapps) are on your 1T HDD?</p>

            <p>yep, i did that… but i shouldn’t have, because steam does work, but it asks for a security code which i can’t get because i can’t access my hotmail account because my hotmail is blocked because some fag hacked it, and for some reason i couldn’t switch my email on steam no matter how many times i tried, but i have contacted both steam support and microsoft to help me with this shit. i am not happy at all, most of my games are on there, and I CAN’T PLAY BMS  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>well, this has to be resolved one day. i’ll post to see if they respond/fix this problem (steam sending me a security code and perhaps changing my email, or Microsoft unblocking my account (despite the countless tries))</p>

            <p>Just cut and paste the steamapps folder elsewhere, then reinstall steam. When you’re done put the steamapps folder back and you’ll still have all of your games.</p>
