    <title>OFFICIAL BLACK MESA SCREENSHOT COMPETITION?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/official-black-mesa-screenshot-competition/12744</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been a while since the OFFICIAL BLACK MESA SCREENSHOT COMPETITION has started, and I&#39;m wondering why it has been abandoned. No results, no new updates, nothing.
And also, the &quot;Official Screenshot Contest Questions / Comments&quot; thread is closed, so I/we can&#39;t even post questions about it. That&#39;s why I made a new thread.

If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;m talking about, here&#39;s the official thread:

[url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14898&#39;]OFFICIAL BLACK MESA SCREENSHOT SUBMISSIONS FORUM[/url]

Or am I missing something maybe? D:

P.S.: if this is the wrong section, please let me know or move this thread to the correct section, please. I couldn&#39;t find a better section to post this.</description>

<p>Ops, my bad. I didn’t noticed that the links here are not fully shown, so I just made “CTRL+C” instead of “Copy link”. I’ve fixed the links now, thank you for letting me know and for the screenshot compliments. Much appreciated!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And, yeah, I think pretty much the same thing. A new competition should be unnecessary, and I also agree with <span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘RoyalBlue’]Dotard</span>.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
But if someone of you want to share some cool shots anyway, I’ll be happy to take a look at them (and probably someone else also, of course).  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I honestly don’t think it’s necessary to make it a competition, since most competitors were users browsing the forums during the month of release, and later left (and most likely the reason Max locked his thread).</p>

<p>I’d say, as a moderator, let’s have this thread be the Black Mesa screenshot thread.  I don’t know if there’s any sort of official competition going on, but I’d say that if you have screenshots of Black Mesa you’d like to submit, let’s see them!</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, I’ve already posted my screenshot in the competition back in the day.<br>
This:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>Why do I have to launch another competition? If the original first competition is probably died, then I do not need to know more I guess. Just waiting a confirm from someone that knows for sure is died.</p>
<p>I also saw that <span class="bbcode-b">[COLOR=‘Navy’]yrr</span> also participated with these 3 links:</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=100745491" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=100745491</a><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: Links fixed</span></p>
<p>He provided some cool screens for sure. :3</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/dotard">@Dotard</a>:</p>
<p>Well, that’s pretty sad then.</p>
<p>But anyway, if you feel that this thread should be a new Screenshots Thread, that I’m ok with it.</p>
<p>Post your shots folks!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Since it’s an competition, I’m assuming that there has been a date where you can’t submit screenshots anymore.And competition always an ending anyway.<br>
