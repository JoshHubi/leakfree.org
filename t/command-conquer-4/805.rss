<p><span class="bbcode-u">I’m new, but I thought I may as well contribute rather than start with the formal ‘hello’:</span></p>
<p>I do agree with Lord Grievous on the issue, especially regarding EA’s rather hefty rebranding of my beloved franchise. Not so in terms of the games themselves, story-elements and such, but rather the gameplay focus itself. Allow me to explain…</p>
<p>Since the dawn of RTS games, there’s always been the ‘rushing’ crowd. I’ve always called them “Crafters” and we all know who they are: those who mastered pumping out 10 zealots in the time it takes the average player to build his first bunker. They’re the crowd that likes to race to the front lines with loads of cheap, insignificant units, drooling for that ‘victory’ screen, their eyes flush red - ripe with blood lust. All of this with the intent of pounding you into the ground as quickly and seamlessly as possible without ever even touching the second tier of development.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Outside the campaign, I doubt some of them even know what other units are available. </span></p>
<p>Regardless, it seems to me that it’s to these people, <span class="bbcode-i">this crowd</span>, that EA seems most drawn, most faithful, and admittedly (from a business standpoint) I can’t blame them: tournaments, leader boards, ladder matches, all great for business. Games are over quicker so that more can begin.</p>
<p>Sadly, this particular style of play doesn’t appeal to me…I’m a strategist, and yes, rushing can be considered a brand of strategy; but I prefer a nice, slow, calculated game of chess over a slap-happy game of checkers. Korean tournaments prove to me, time and time again, that the victory most often goes not to the player who can mount an effective assault; but the player who can field the most units in the least amount of time.</p>
<p>It’s not just EA though! Aside from the Supreme Commander series and perhaps the Age of Empires series (R.I.P.), today’s RTS genre is very rush-oriented and we’re seeing it even more in future releases such as Starcraft 2. It’s this gradual shift in audience that’s turned me even more into a 4x geek: Civilization, Sword of the Stars, Galactic Civilization, Total War, etc. Many allow for the RTS elements, like Total War, but with a certain level of strategic flair that really appeals to me. I’m sure many of you will disagree with me, and others will say, “So? You’re just upset you can’t defend against a rush”; but it isn’t whether I can defend against a rush, but whether I’m having fun while doing it.</p>
<p>Edit: tl/dr: I find that rushing tends to spoil the enjoyment I get from building up a base, definding strategies and trying to conquer through outwitting my opponent in contrast to spamming/overwhelming him with numbers in the first 5 minutes of the game. Further, I find that EA tends to curtail their development toward this particular player base.</p>

<p>Thank you for a very intelligent formulate first post! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  <em>tingly sensation</em></p>
<p>I totally agree.  Some developers do indeed cater to rushes, even advocating them (as can be seen at some points in the Halo Wars tip bar).  Indeed, this is a valid strategy…but I don’t play that way.  And that’s why I am promptly demolished.  I refuse to bend to their level, and, thus, I am slaughtered.  It’s not fun.</p>

It’s this gradual shift in audience that’s turned me even more into a 4x geek: Civilization, Sword of the Stars, Galactic Civilization, Total War, etc. Many allow for the RTS elements, like Total War, but with a certain level of strategic flair that really appeals to me. I’m sure many of you will disagree with me, and others will say, “So? You’re just upset you can’t defend against a rush”; but it isn’t whether I can defend against a rush, but whether I’m having fun while doing it.</p>
<p>Edit: tl/dr: I find that rushing tends to spoil the enjoyment I get from building up a base, defining strategies and trying to conquer my opponent through tactics in contrast to spamming/overwhelming him with numbers in the first 5 minutes of the game. Further, I find that EA tends to curtail their development toward this particular player base.</p>

<p>I do recall the explanation for tiberium changing being given in the first GDI mission in CNC 3, even in the demo you got that.<br>
But i didn’t like CNC 3 compared to TS, i loved to play TS when i decided to try it out, after i played CNC 3, i hate how they removed stuff like walls, gates, etc.</p>
<p>Red alert 3 was just a little over the top for me, the gameplay was way too fast for a normal cnc game, and every unit having two or more modes just took the fun away of having different units at all.</p>
<p>In Red alert 2, you could build up a strong defence, and then launch attacks swiftly, but in most RA3 missions, you’ve got time limits, unit limits, and resource limits.<br>
And then when you finally get the chance to build up your base, the enemy has 3 superweapons ready to blow up your whole base, and your allies’ base. Tanya was so weak that you’d have to train her like 10 times in one mission, whereas in a RA2 mission, tanya only lives once.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s purely a rusher’s game, the turtlers can’t do jack shit without walls and gates. Not to mention that most missions don’t take as long as the TS/FS ones. Ten minute matches…no thanks, that’s not worth launching the game for.</p>

            <p>I sort of agree with Grievous. After seeing Red Alert 3, I seriously doubt they care anything at all about the CnC franchise, other than it makes them money.</p>

            <p>[COLOR=‘Red’]I’m issuing some infractions for the way Lord Grievous was attacked for expressing his opinion.</p>
<p>Here’s a tip guys: if someone doesn’t like a game you do, it’s not the end of the world. Notice how I haven’t flamed to a crisp all the people dismissing L4D2 even though I’m looking forward to it immensely? You too can take the high road, and in fact you’d better, or I’ll have to take action. Disagreeing with someone is fine, but argue with their opinion, don’t attack them personally.</p>
