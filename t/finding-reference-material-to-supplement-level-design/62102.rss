    <title>Finding Reference Material To Supplement Level Design</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/finding-reference-material-to-supplement-level-design/62102</link>
    <description>I&#39;m very new this this forum (so I hope I&#39;m posting this in the right section) but a long time follower (and player) of the Black Mesa Source project. As someone who&#39;s started going through the motions of level design, I&#39;m curious as to where the Black Mesa community finds reference images to help design their levels.

I&#39;ve personally been wanting to design a level based around a nuclear power plant (original, I know), but I&#39;ve been struggling to find comprehensive reference images/videos on the web, any advice?

Apologies in advance if this is the wrong section.</description>

            <p>Well, I actually work in a research university so I can just wander around and take pictures of different areas. It helps that I own a shirt that looks very similar to the uniforms the maintenance people here wear.</p>
