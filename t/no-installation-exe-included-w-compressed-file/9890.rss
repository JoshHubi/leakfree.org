            <p>Isn’t the folder named “BMS” and not “bms”.<br>
Not sure if caps matters but it could very well.</p>

            <p>If anyone, for any reason, is unable to obtain the setup executable, it’s entirely possible to just unzip all that stuff into a folder called “bms” in the Steam/steamapps/Sourcemods folder. You don’t get to see the neat-looking installer, but that’s basically all it does.</p>

            <p>Download the installer and put it in the same folder as the blackmesa 7zip file.<br>
You can download just the installer here: <a href="https://miclau.net/mgo/redirect/BlackMesa/BlackMesa-Setup.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BlackMesa-Setup.exe</a></p>
<p>Once the installs finished restart steam and you can launch the game from there.</p>
