    <title>Recording sound effects for maps/mods</title>

    <description>What kind of equipment do I need for that job?

Of course a portable audio recorder. But do I also need a separate shotgun mic or are the integrated stereo microphones of most of the common portable recorders good enough for that job?

And is it required to have a microphone boom arm and would you recommend using headphones, while recording?

Thanks for asnwers!</description>

            <p>Do you really want to do this? I mean, if you’re just making some modification and need sounds and effects the easier and obviously cheeper way is to seek for content on the web. Recording sounds on your own isn’t that simple and requires specific accoustic knowledge to do it right. This is one thing. Second is equipment and it’s price. In this case the cheaper the better won’t work so you’re gonna need quite a budget to purchase good condenser microphone, recorder with good audio converters, and quality, comfortable headphones (I think I dont need to explain why). The third thing - post-production. Even if you record anything that might be useful, it’s still long way before it could be used. Here - again - you could use some accoustic knowledge and if you dont have any it will get even more difficult for you.</p>
<p>So, to cut long story short, if it was me I would seek for some cool sounds I could use (for example here: <a href="https://www.freesound.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.freesound.org</a>) and thet redo them in any DAW with some cool effects. For DAW I would advise any of these: Ableton Live, FL Studio, Cubase, Reason. Also for effects and high quality synth modules (which can be useful) look here: <a href="https://www.nativeinstruments.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.nativeinstruments.com</a>.</p>
