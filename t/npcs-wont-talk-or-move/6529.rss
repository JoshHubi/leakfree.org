    <title>NPC&#39;s won&#39;t talk. Or move.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/npcs-wont-talk-or-move/6529</link>
    <description>I turned on HL 2 today (after about a month or so of not playing) and I decided to play from the begining again. I got to Gman, and he just stood there, looking around. He made no noise. All you could hear is the background noise.

When the gman scene ended, I tried to talk to the NPC with the brief case on the train by the door, and he just looked at me. The same happened with the other one. They never exited the train after it stopped moving.

Dr. Breen never came up on the screen, and Alyx doesn&#39;t move. And neither does Barney. Pretty much nobody does anything. All of these things work fine in EP 1 and Ep 2.

Any Ideas?

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, defragging it, trying it on a different computer, enabling and turning off the cloud, and restarting steam to no avail.</description>

            <p>Alright, new problem. I installed Source SDK again, and did what was suggested, but now HL2 doesn’t run. It turns on, but just sits there loading. Oh, and Source SDK had corrupt files or something when I tried to run some of the things (ie face poser, model viewer etc.)</p>

<p>Nope it’s legal. And I will try that.</p>
<p>EDIT: Nope. It didn’t work. The game is still messed up. Does this have anything to do with source SDK? My bro messed around with it a month or so ago, and that was right around the time I stopped playing for awhile. Could he have deleted the something important?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Maybe verify integrity of game files from source sdk and after that do the same with Half-Life 2?</p>
<p>That’s the last thing i can think of.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
(or maybe reinstall both)</p>

            <p>The crash of the AI is a typical issue with pirated copies :pirate: . I remember seeing (hey Alyx also said seeing once) forums crying on this issue through a lot of pages.</p>

            <p>Try verifying integrity of game cache,<br>
or try to deinstall the game, delete the folder where it has been installed in and reinstall the game.</p>
<p>Btw, is it pirated?<br>
Because this problem mostly occurs with pirated versions of the game.</p>

            <p>Nope, it just turned them off. Now they just stare rather than look around. I turned it back on and they resumed looking around.</p>
