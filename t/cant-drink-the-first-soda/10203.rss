    <description>Mark this &quot;Oh god who even notices these things&quot;, but every vending machine I&#39;ve hit so far, the first soda vends but you can&#39;t drink it.  All further sodas vend and drink.

            <p>I had the same issue with every soda machine except for the first one I encountered in the game. The issue is apparently a matter of physics/design and not a “software-side” glitch. What appears to be happening is the first can falls into the dispenser as it should, but your bounding box doesn’t protrude into the machine enough to actually trigger a pickup.</p>
<p>The second and subsequent cans will fall, hit the first can, and the bounce out of the machine, allowing an automatic pickup as they hit the player’s bounding box. To pick up the FIRST can of soda, you have to use the E key to pick it up out of the machine, drop it on the floor and then walk over it.</p>
<p>Something that seems to support this: If I pick up the first can out of the machine with the E key and move it out of the way, then stand against the front of the machine and press the buttons, the can stays in the dispenser same as the first one does.</p>
<p>No idea why the first soda machine I encountered didn’t do this…</p>
