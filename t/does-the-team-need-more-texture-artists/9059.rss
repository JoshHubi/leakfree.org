    <title>Does the team need more Texture Artists ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/does-the-team-need-more-texture-artists/9059</link>
    <description>I couldn&#39;t directly found any Apply Form for the Team so I&#39;m asking: Does the mod Team still require any Texture Artists or anyone who&#39;s known with the Source Engine for over 5 years ?

If they still need to would anyone please redirect me to the place where I do this?

Thanks in advance, regards Rafaël De Jongh

</aside>
<p>Agreed, using a vertical scroll motion to move horizontally is completely counter-intuitive. Not to mention the horizontal scrollbar at the foot of the page is really hard to spot. Also the “return to top” thing uses a page reload, why not just anchor it to the beginning?</p>
<p>Hopefully these are all things you can solve when you redesign your portfolio. I must say your work looks pretty good, so ought to have a portfolio that doesn’t let down the content!</p>

<p>Thanks, but the scrollbar is made like that, it uses javascript to make the normal scrollbar “vertical” to scroll horizontal so it would be as easy to just scroll down to go to the side, as for the name it was my previous screen name that now changed to my original name that’s why the last releases actually got my real name and not my screen name!</p>
<p>Though thanks for your interest and suggestions, this is rather a old portfolio of mine ±9months old so I’m going to change it soon.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why would you try and seek work with a 9 month old portfolio? Surely showing your latest work would make a lot more sense?</p>

<p>Rather than forcing people to use their browsers horizontal scrollbar, put one on the page, where it’s supposed to be used anyway. Also, in your projects page, don’t refer to yourself as Boba Fett. Sure it’s your screenname but shit son, use your real name on your portfolio.</p>

            <p>Pretty sure they don’t need any more people on the team at this point and I think they’d ask for more people if that were the case.</p>

            <p>I couldn’t directly found any Apply Form for the Team so I’m asking: Does the mod Team still require any Texture Artists or anyone who’s known with the Source Engine for over 5 years ?</p>
<p>If they still need to would anyone please redirect me to the place where I do this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, regards Rafaël De Jongh<br>
