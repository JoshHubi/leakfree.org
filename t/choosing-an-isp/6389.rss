    <title>Choosing an ISP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/choosing-an-isp/6389</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting kind of fed up with my Clear service. Up until now it was actually pretty good - it was a breeze to set up, I got good download speeds, and I was happy. But now for the past few days my service has been all over the place - sometimes my speed is way more than I should be getting, but mostly it&#39;s way less, with terrible ping. And it&#39;s been making me think it&#39;s time to switch ISPs. I was just scraping by in online games with my ping anyway, and my service goes out whenever it rains (the time I&#39;d probably most want to use the internet), so I was thinking I should go with a physical connection this time. With that I ought to get better pings and have better reliability, only I&#39;m not sure which ISP to go with. I know if I were to heed the warnings of every person on the internet I&#39;d end up with no internet at all, because it seems that every ISP is the devil.

So, I guess I&#39;d just like some input on my decision before I make it. I know I don&#39;t have Comcast or Verizon FiOS in my area. My main options are Time Warner, AT&amp;T, Grande, and Clear, I think. I can&#39;t think of any others, if you know of any that service my zip - 78209 - let me know. Right now I&#39;m leaning towards TWC since they have a 15M/2M service for $40 a month, which seems to be the best value of any plan I&#39;ve seen so far.</description>

            <p>Not right now, because the majority of companies will still keep their old addresses, with an option to move to the new IPv6 for those who want to. However, in a few years, then people might be forced to upgrade.</p>

            <p>where i live, Verizon charges me the same price that cable does at 15mb/s down for 50mb/s, although i only really get 35-40Mb/s. FIOS is still the best bet, at least till Google has an ISP.</p>

            <p>With the options you say you have, your best bet is Time warner.</p>
<p>The speeds are good, so you’re looking  at dl speeds of an estimated 2-5 megabtes per second, if its from a reliable source (For example, Steam) and ping shouldnt be a problem. Port forwarding would boost the two greatly.</p>
<p>Also, time warner isn’t a tattle-tale on piracy, so that’s always nice(:</p>
<p>Edit: And TWC Supports IPV4, and i’m not aware of any ISP’s moving to IPV6, as i believe it is still in its alpha development, even if you could find an ISP with that, it would be stupid, considering it doesn’t work with IPV4.</p>
