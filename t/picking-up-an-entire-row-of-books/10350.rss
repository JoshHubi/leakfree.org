This is pretty weird, and I&#39;m pretty sure you shouldn&#39;t be able to pick it up.

            <p>Well, you really don’t need to do calculations for a crapload of books when they’re static, so it breaks up into gibs (books) when a force is applied to it, because the most likely interaction with these books is, well, shooting them.</p>
