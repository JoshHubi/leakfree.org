    <description>A few bugs I&#39;ve found on my latest playthrough.

For starters, I don&#39;t know [i]what [/i]I did to trigger this, but in Power Up, for a while, some of the Marines above the generator were ignoring me (getpos info is in the screenshots at the top-right, console was flooding with the flashlight message):

Some graphical things I&#39;ve noticed, too.

I only got a still image, but this part of the metal walkway has some z-fighting going on. It looks to me like it&#39;s supposed to break, like it did in HL1, is that the case?

In OaR, I didn&#39;t get a getpos because I forgot (different session) and I only checked the first map, but the rotating elevator support just sort of... clips through the floor:

Had this happen at the end of Apprehension - one of the Marines is invisible, for some reason. 8|  If it helps any, the only thing out of the ordinary I did that I can think of was tossing a grenade over the crates on the right side of the door after entering (the ones to the right of the visible Marine in the image).

And then, something minor in Residue Processing - the fade distance on this spool model thingy is too close, and it&#39;s a physics prop, so players can carry it around to a place where the fade distance is more obvious:

            <p>I too have had AI not respond and stand around. No definitive way to reproduce, seems to be random.</p>

            <p>I can confirm the flashlight error flooding the console. Also the metal stairway does break but you have to walk over it quite a few times before it does.</p>
