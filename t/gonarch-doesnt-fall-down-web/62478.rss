    <title>Gonarch Doesn&#39;t Fall Down Web</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gonarch-doesnt-fall-down-web/62478</link>
    <description>I was doing damage to the Gonarch when he stopped moving and shooting. All enemy AI ignored me and I was forced to restart. My guess is that the game isn&#39;t triggering the sequence when the Gonarch is supposed to fall down the web. This could be why the game doesn&#39;t progress.
