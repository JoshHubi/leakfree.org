    <title>What to do before release, so the internet doesn&#39;t die.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-to-do-before-release-so-the-internet-doesnt-die/2856</link>
    <description>Just as the title suggests, we should think of a way to get the game out to a lot of people before/while ModDb, Black Mesa, File planet and all other download locations crash. 

maybe 48 hours before release, the BM team gives the top most trusted Forum members (the guys who have been here the longest) a torrent and they can seed to the rest of the forum members once the release date is reached. once that happens, they can seed for everybody else.

any better ideas?</description>

            <p>Im pretty sure the devs have it covered, it will spread across many different servers and we shouldnt have a problem. Who knows Valve may put it on steam (for free of course) as they have added steam support for alot of mods, and not many as amazing as this.</p>

<p>yes, but people like me could upload for a lot of users. I have 30 MB/s, i don’t put a bandwidth cap on Utorrent, so theoretically i could upload 500 KB - 1 MB/s for a lot of people.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/mattemuse">@mattemuse</a></p>
<p>the notion of encryptions/passwords are just stupid. this is about the viability of server bandwidth, not integrity of individuals. If the devs gave it to the right people a week or so before launch, then they could effectively start seeding at launch. The reason people keep talking about passwords is because they want it on their computer the second it’s released.</p>

            <p>I like how so many people think it’s a realistic solution to release the game a day early, and then release a password instead of the installer. I bet they think it gets dark outside when they close their eyes, too…</p>
