    <title>Common Athlon XP issue, &#39;cannot load client library&#39;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/common-athlon-xp-issue-cannot-load-client-library/10330</link>
    <description>There is a problem with Black Mesa which seems common to anyone running an Athlon Xp system.

When trying to run Black Mesa the following error occurs:

&#39;Could not load library client&#39;.

That this affects Athlon Xp users seems to indicate that the client.dll (and server.dll?) does not support SSE, which is what these processor sets use as opposed to the later SSE2 etc.

These machines, mine and many others, are technically capable of running the game as swapping the client.dll in the BMS .bin for one out of the SDKbas2007, sourcetest .bin, allows the game to run and begin, but you cannot progress beyond the end of the Tram ride or use the options menu as the .dll is wrong. But it shows that the machines *can* run Black Mesa and SDK2007.

Others have speculated that this means that the .dll&#39;s need recompiling for SSE.
