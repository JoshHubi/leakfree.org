    <title>RAM Upgrade</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ram-upgrade/6404</link>
    <description>In my computer, I have 3GB of RAM. 2GB are a dual channel set of 1GB sticks, the other is an 1GB stick whose mate died. I have 4 RAM slots, so I&#39;ve got one free. I was considering purchasing some more RAM, and I was just wondering what to get. I&#39;m considering three options (I have Windows 7 x64):
 
2GB stick in free slot - cheapest
2x1GB sticks, remove unmatched stick - a little more expensive
2x2GB sticks, remove unmatched stick - most expensive

Obviously the most expensive option is best, but between the other two, is there a significant difference between having the extra 1GB vs having all memory in dual channel sets?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I ended up getting 2x2GB. I decided to just avoid the issue altogether. Since I was also buying a new hard drive, I just got a cheaper, and incidentally better rated, hard drive to offset the extra cost of the RAM(inator). Also, since Newegg was having a 15% off any memory promo, it was even less. So that was cool. Thanks for the input, you can still discuss but I’ve got my upgrade completed now.</p>

            <p>I don’t get it. You have 3x1gb sticks, just buy a 1gb stick matching the single stick as closely as possible. Even if it doesn’t match it will still work in single-channel mode, as will a 2gb stick in that same slot, but will be cheaper. Plus, 4gb vs 5gb ram shouldn’t make that much of a difference.</p>

            <p>In my computer, I have 3GB of RAM. 2GB are a dual channel set of 1GB sticks, the other is an 1GB stick whose mate died. I have 4 RAM slots, so I’ve got one free. I was considering purchasing some more RAM, and I was just wondering what to get. I’m considering three options (I have Windows 7 x64):</p>
<p>2GB stick in free slot - cheapest<br>
2x1GB sticks, remove unmatched stick - a little more expensive<br>
2x2GB sticks, remove unmatched stick - most expensive</p>
<p>Obviously the most expensive option is best, but between the other two, is there a significant difference between having the extra 1GB vs having all memory in dual channel sets?</p>
