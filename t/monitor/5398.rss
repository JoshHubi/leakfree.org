    <description>&quot;Gaming&quot; LCD. Under $300. (Hoping for something with a 5ms response time, but is 2ms ok for gaming?) I have no idea how to differentiate contrast ratios; I just know dynamic ones are better. Derp.

I&#39;d prefer over widescreen over 20&#39;&#39;. I&#39;m looking too, but I want to see the opinion of others before I make a purchase.

Thanks.</description>

            <p>I’m also gonna disagree that 1920x1080 is shit, most games that support 16:10 also support 16:9 natively. Also you shouldn’t rely on scaling to play games faster, with LCD’s it’s either native resolution or disabled scaling for good quality.</p>

<p>It [[COLOR=‘Red’]lag] has nothing to do with the fact that the resolution is 1920x1080.  However, display quality / image scaling DOES.  Most people (who know their stuff) prefer 16:10 for computing uses, and 16:9 for media.

Because I have a 5870, and I’m positive that I could run Crysis maxed out at 1920x1200 if I had a monitor that large (but I don’t, so I run Crysis at 100fps @ 1440x900).</p>
<p>So unless you have a bitchin’ videocard, you’re better off with 1680x1050ish.  Especially if you plan on playing games that will come out in the near future WITHOUT having to upgrade your videocard.  For example, your current graphics card can play Crysis @ 1920x1080, but in a year, a new “Crysis” will come out (i.e. a game that brings GPUs to their knees) and you’ll suddenly be gaming at 1024x768 just to get playable framerates.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, I’m not necessarily saying 1920x1080 is better than anything else, I was simple disagreeing with everyone else saying it was shit. My videocard is a 9800gtx. My computer is over a year old and I have yet to find a game it can’t handle full settings. guess you know more than me and OP is best off going with your advice.</p>

<p>I figure I’ll get 16:10 a monitor, but run (Crysis type GPU intensive) games at 1680x1050. I’ve found nothing on the web that mentions scaling being horrible. I’m confident (hoping) that my GPU/monitor will be able to scale without tearing or anything like that. (If there is some, I’m hoping it will be very minor. If this was a big problem I’d think there would be something out there I could have found on the subject.)</p>

<p>Because that is a 16:9 aspect ratio. 16:9 is a widescreen movie ratio. For example 1920x1080 is a 1080P movie. 1280x720 is a 720P movie. For a long time 16:10 ( or 8:5 ) was the standard for computer monitors, however it is becoming less common to see 16:10 aspect ratio monitors, and that makes me a sad panda because I don’t like things <span class="bbcode-i">THAT</span> widescreen.</p>
<p>Also @ vivanto : No matter what scaling has a negative impact on image quality, even if it is the correct aspect ratio.</p>

</aside>
<p>Can configure your videocard and/or monitor for that. Or just use a custom resolution with dimensions that are relative primes to the other.</p>
<p>If you still need a 1:1 pixel ratio, just disable resolution stretching, your active display area will be exactly the same as with a smaller display.</p>
<p>I know I wouldn’t give up the extra space when working with any text editors, IDEs, design apps, cad, studio, maya, ps etc…, or just watching movies. But also ain’t gonna cash out for a fancy video adapter just for the sake of games.</p>

<p>As Sersoft said - “1920x1080 is for TV’s your display quality will be shit.”</p>
<p>And as I said earlier in this thread - “Stay away from monitors that offer 1900x1080. These are generally considered to be panels meant for TVs and are converted for computer use”.  In other words, TVs don’t need fantastic refresh rates, or true-to-life color reproduction.  Computer monitors generally do.  So when you take a panel that started its life destined to be a TV, and someone came along and said, “Nope you’re going into a computer monitor,” bad things happen.  Like you paying for a shitty monitor  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>It doesn’t really matter what you chose. At 300 bucks you are only going to be getting a TN panel. Despite what the specifications say they, there is very little to distinguish one TN panel from another. You are going to be stuck with a 6 bit display with poor viewing angles. The problem is the specifications listed can be skewed with different measuring techniques. Most of the amount to very little on TN panels.<br>
If you are looking to get a good IPS panel <a href="https://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/products/Monitors/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=320-8277" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE IS ONE</a> it is IPS and it has a low response time and low input lag that some IPS monitors are not as good at when compared to TN panels.</p>

<p>Or just don’t run stuff on full native resolution. Gonna use that screen for a lot of other things than just games (I hope), where a larger workspace is a big bonus.</p>

            <p>Most people don’t notice the difference in response time between 2ms and 5ms but when I’m playing CS it helps alot. Personally I need at least 2ms, I used to have a slow response time screen and it pissed me off so much. So if you don’t play fast paced twitch shooting games, you don’t need a 2ms screen.</p>

            <p>Everyone who has posted here should read this article - very edifying.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/display_myths_shattered" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Maximum PC - Display Myths Shattered</a></p>
<p>As you said Medevilae - bloated numbers.  The best thing you can do is read reviews and compare features.  My above post still stands though - avoid the 1900x1080s, go for something with an eIPS (not TN) panel, unless you PURELY want the highest response time, and I agree with Sersoft (as usual) -</p>
<p>“if you’re going for more than 24 inches try to get a badass resolution like 2560x1600”</p>
<p>“[COLOR=‘Black’]2ms response time is way better than 5ms, also if you want newer games to lag less go for a 1680x1050 screen, otherwise 1920x1200 and up…”</p>

<p>At under $300 while keeping the response time at 2ms? :jizz:</p>

<p>I’m liking this I-INC one, but the NCR is only 800:1? DCR is 15000:1, which doesn’t look impressive next to the bloated figures of most monitor companies.</p>
