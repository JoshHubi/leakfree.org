            <p>Gordon Freeman is 26 years old. Hugh Laurie and Gary Oldman (who’s an enormously famous and respected actor and has been since Sid and Nancy in the 80’s; not sure where the idea came from that he wasn’t) are in their 50s. Either would have been fine in their heyday, but they’re just too old for the character now.</p>
<p>Granted, Deniro and Pesci played versions of themselves in their 20s in Goodfellas, but it was just for a short portion of the movie and was not convincing at all.</p>
<p>I still think Armie Hammer would be good. He’s got the intelligence and class of someone you’d believe came from an Ivy League school, but the physicality and presence of someone who could kick all kinds of alien ass.</p>

            <p>For a Half-Life movie I always saw Christopher Walken as the G-Man. Walken just has this weird way he talks and moves that he almost perfectly fits the G-Man except that Walken is always hilarious no matter what he does so that might ruin the G-Man’s character a bit. Hmmm… on second thought Valve should just use Source Filmmaker instead to make the film.</p>

            <p>I think if there’s a half life film, it shouldn’t follow Gordon, because that would involve destroying the fanbase’s characterization of him as a mute badass scientist. Follow other characters, and have Gordon appear maybe once or twice. Get some different characters and put them in situations like alien strikes and being questioned by the military. We could even see Eli’s wife brutally executed by a shot to the head. Stuff like that would make it an interesting companion to the game and not interfere with established canon.</p>

<p>I think Valve should make the movie themselves in CGI. They could do it and they’re the only ones that, I think, that could do it right.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>HL just doesn’t have the right feel for CG. It would just be one of those movies like Beowulf. You know: “The models look like the actors, and the scenes aren’t all too difficult to film in real life…most of it is talking, but it looks shit because it’s so deep in uncanny valley… Why the fuck is this all CG?”</p>
<p>It would be a lot better live action imo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being a video game movie ruins video game movies.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not sure this has to be true, though it’s generally been true in the past. I honestly think it might be possible to make a movie which uses the core elements of a video game as its driving force and to end up with something that has merit - in the case of Half-Life, it might be wise to start with Black Mesa, the central disaster, a scientist trapped at the heart of it (Freeman) and then work from there, not worrying too much about what the fans will think but rather worrying about what will make a good film. The problem is that the fans will almost literally froth at the mouth with rage when they actually watch it, even though - as a piece of art in its own right - it would be something worth watching rather than another confused Uwe Boll catastrophe.</p>

<p>Yeah, but they’ve also said they were working on ideas themselves.  They didn’t say they weren’t willing to make a movie exactly, just that they at least want to have some control over it, especially the script.  If they do do that, though, I still don’t think they’re not going to have “profit” as a major goal of theirs.</p>

            <p>I think Valve should make the movie themselves in CGI. They could do it and they’re the only ones that, I think, that could do it right.</p>

<p>Not if there goal is to make loads of money.  If can’t make enough money to make the movie worth it if they market it just to us.  It costs a lot more money to make a movie than a video-game, with GTA IV being the only possible exclusion, but even then, movies regularly cost more than it did.</p>

            <p>(subject: dubbing) It’s such a shitty idea. The main charm of a film adaptation is the difference from the source material. I wouldn’t pay 8 bucks to hear more of the same shit I can hear in-game.</p>

This Jesse Eisenberg right here would be a decent Gordon Freeman. He’s got the right facial structure, build, and age. Plus, he can act his way out of a urethra.</p>
