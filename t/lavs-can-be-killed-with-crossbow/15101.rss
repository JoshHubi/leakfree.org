I can imagine how easy of an oversight this must have been to make, and I didn&#39;t notice it until I was testing the OnDamaged output in a map I was working on, but something to look into fixing.
After all, even a non-tranquilizer crossbow shouldn&#39;t be able to pierce the LAV&#39;s armor, let alone blow the entire thing up.</description>

            <p>What <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/29054-LordDz/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@LordDz</a> said, also I’m sure that the crossbow explosive damage isn’t even THAT powerful, not enough on the levels of RPG/MP5 Grenade at least. Most of the damage comes from the direct hits.</p>

            <p>Based on some of the loading-screen dialogue, the crossbow actually does deal explosive damage.</p>

<p>Well that’s kind of the thing - bullets don’t damage the LAV at all, neither does the crowbar, hivehand, etc. There’s a damage filter on it that excludes most damage types so that you have to use explosives on the LAV, regardless of how much damage the other weapons deal. But somehow the crossbow also accidentally made it on that list.</p>
