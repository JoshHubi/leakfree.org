    <description>My dad wants to make some youtube guitar lesson tutorials. He needs a recording microphone. What do you guys recommend? Preferably around 75-150 dollars, my dad doesn&#39;t need to get too professional with this.</description>

            <p>The tbone SC 440 USB or tbone SC 450 USB. They sounds very very good.<br>
The price is very low I think.</p>
<p>There are podcasts budle with popkiller and something like this for just 20 € more.</p>

            <p>I use this for my guitary needs: <a href="https://apogeedigital.com/products/one.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://apogeedigital.com/products/one.php</a></p>
<p>The built-in mic is amazing + it has a digital input for electric guitar and bass (as well as an extra connection for mic (with phantom power)).</p>
<p>It’s a bit pricier, but considering the extra possibilities, it’s a good deal.</p>
<p>Main downside: designed for Mac, not sure how well it works for Windows.</p>

            <p>It depends on where the sound source is originating from.<br>
Is the guitar amped or are you simply using it as acoustic?</p>
<p>If no amp is in place, the best package for you is the MXL 990/991. Don’t be fooled by the price! The Behringer C3 is also a nice multi-pattern condenser for little money. Keep in mind that neither of these two come with cables or cradles you will have to purchase those separately.</p>
<p>If you have to stick with a dynamic mic, due to lack of phantom power,  you will find the Shure SM<span class="bbcode-b">57 </span>is your best bet.</p>
