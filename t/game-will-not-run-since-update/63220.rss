    <title>Game will not run since update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-will-not-run-since-update/63220</link>
    <description>Obviously there was a recent update with the release of the Xen level.  Ever since then the game will not run.  Before that not only would it run but it would do so at close to 120 fps.  I opened a support ticket and was told that my hardware cannot run the newer version and the solution is to roll back the update.  Of course this would mean no Xen level.  This game was sold/purchased stating that Xen would be included but never said it would break the game.  I requested a refund via Steam but was denied because of their 2 week refund policy.  I refuse to pay several hundred dollars to play a game that cost me $10.  This was not because my hardware changed but because the software was.</description>

            <p>So out of frustration I started poking into the files and found one that was labeled videoconfig.cfg.  I deleted and the game runs now!  Not only that, at the lowest so far it drops to about 50 fps but have seen as high as 160 fps.</p>

            <p>But my PC did meet the system requirements when I bought it in 2015.  Nothing changed on my end.  Heck, even in 2017 my PC still met the specs.  So, it’s not my fault they changed it to where it would not run on my PC.</p>

            <p>I’m not trying to be defensive but, the system requirements were published prior to you purchasing it. If your system didn’t meet those requirements you can’t blame them now that Xen has been released and your system can’t run it. You were told before you paid for it. If you didn’t read the requirements it’s your fault and not theirs.</p>
