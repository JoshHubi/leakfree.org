    <title>Kliener and Eli</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/kliener-and-eli/1179</link>
    <description>So, I read the FAQ and saw that Kliener and Eli will be in the game; being the scientists near the exploded computer terminal once you first exit the testchamber. This is all fine and good, but this raises the question:

How the hell do they get out of the Anomalous Materials Lab?


The Tram&#39;s out; and the lift, if they could recall it, would require them to squeeze through vents, climb up ladders, and somehow fight off the headcrabs and houndeyes. And even then, they&#39;re only going down, passing through even MORE difficult obstacles and enemies, and if they DO make it to the surface, they&#39;re likely to be simply gunned down by HECU.

I know I&#39;m being nitpicky here, and that its unlikely to be addressed in the Mod, but I&#39;d just like there to be some way as to explain how they escaped. Maybe have a guard mention later on that some Black Mesa Security managed to rescue them and that they wish Gordon the best of luck; some form of acknowledgment that they made it out OK. Cause as it stands, I don&#39;t see how they could make it out, especially if Kliener is unconscious and unable to move.</description>

            <p>The FAQ itself states that those scientists ARE Kliener and Eli in the mod.</p>
<p>I know its a trivial point, but now that we’re actually tying them into the canon of Black Mesa, I feel it should be addressed. I know the whole affair is non-canonical to begin with (Unless Valve REALLY likes it); but I feel at the very least their should be some kind of recognition they escaped.</p>

            <p>Why do people take the rendition of the maps (back in what, 1996?) to be absolutely accurate of what the designers had in mind?</p>
<p>When Half-Life came out, games weren’t able to fully furnish their maps with all of the extra stuff that you see in games today. Take a look at TF2 or even HL2 and notice how there are many areas/doors that you can’t access. Half-Life 1 had almost none of these, likely due to the fact that it was designed to be run in software mode by a good portion of the end users.</p>
<p>Simply put, Valve would’ve likely designed the area with more exits with retinal scanners if they could’ve. The omittion of them back then does not mean that it should necessarily be considered canonical in the present.</p>

            <p>There was no Eli or Kliener when they made the game. Remember, eli was an amalgam of two other characters that came about after the hl2 beta leak in 03. I do believe that Marc Laidlaw said something to the extent of, if we could rewrite halflife, we would have put eli and izzy ias the  people who helped gordon get through the first security door.  So make some stuff up, as it will be just as valid as any other speculation on these forums. Remember, there is NO continuity set up in the game. Valve writers write as they go along. All security guards were named barney. All of the scientists sound like kliener. Magnuson was added really late in the series but with a few lines about a casserole, BAM, reverse continuity. Mostly, because of the state of technology (or lack thereof) in the games. That is why characters like alyx and barney are such a big deal. There was no way to have them in the first hl. It was such a big deal that npc’s would follow gordon that they rewrote most of the game to accommodate  this gameplay. So, they escaped via the same giant portal in the g-mans asshole that also helped alyx escape. It was the same portal that houses the v22 osprey that Shepard is locked away in forever. That means the g-man only releases people from his ass that he will use later on. And thats hard, fast, throbbing, purple mushroom tipped continuity. As laid down by valve themselves, the g-man is Gordon’s dad.:freeman:</p>

            <p>Here is an idea: Maybe they walked out of Black Mesa.</p>
<p>Here is another idea: maybe they killed any Xen/Marines/Gordons sent to kill them.</p>
<p>Here is yet another idea: Since no one seems to care about trivial details, how about we just forget about the thread?</p>

            <p>maybe some kind of portal appeared near them? if you remmember there were portals in glasses(one of which was broken) they could have used it… also there was room which was closed maybe went exit there? also in offise complex there was door which freeman couldn’t open. maybe they managed to open it?</p>
<p>after that i don’t think that they could get any further, It is less like that kliner or Eli could jump on stairs in lift shaft…<br>
ow i’d like to know very much wich guard will be barney…</p>

            <p>you must remember that they have higher security ranking than gordon, the probably just walked out through some shortcut being able to utilize the eye retinal scanners. as for being unconcious, he probably didn’t stay that way.</p>

            <p>It does to me. I’m kind of a stickler for continuity.</p>
<p>I just don’t see how two unarmed scientists (One of which is unconscious) could make it out of the bowels of the facility by themselves. I feel there needs to be some form of explanation given, even if its only in passing.</p>

            <p>Perhaps they got out the same way Gordon got out. After all, they’re all scientists. Only difference being Gordon has the HEV.</p>
<p>Another possibility being that the G-Man guided them out for potential use later, as he did with Alyx Vance.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn’t really matter.</p>

            <p>So, I read the FAQ and saw that Kliener and Eli will be in the game; being the scientists near the exploded computer terminal once you first exit the testchamber. This is all fine and good, but this raises the question:</p>
<p>How the hell do they get out of the Anomalous Materials Lab?</p>
<p>The Tram’s out; and the lift, if they could recall it, would require them to squeeze through vents, climb up ladders, and somehow fight off the headcrabs and houndeyes. And even then, they’re only going down, passing through even MORE difficult obstacles and enemies, and if they DO make it to the surface, they’re likely to be simply gunned down by HECU.</p>
<p>I know I’m being nitpicky here, and that its unlikely to be addressed in the Mod, but I’d just like there to be some way as to explain how they escaped. Maybe have a guard mention later on that some Black Mesa Security managed to rescue them and that they wish Gordon the best of luck; some form of acknowledgment that they made it out OK. Cause as it stands, I don’t see how they could make it out, especially if Kliener is unconscious and unable to move.</p>
