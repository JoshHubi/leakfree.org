<p>Dude, shut the hell up. Just because you don’t agree with something does’nt mean you have to try and destroy a thread by piece. Not everyone know all this stuff about the internet.</p>
<p>Anyways, this thread title made me laugh. Because the button pisses me off when I type a long message and for, SOME REASON, when I click backspace it takes me back losing my whole message.</p>
