    <title>Disappearing HUD elements</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/disappearing-hud-elements/9959</link>
    <description>Sometimes certain HUD elements (such as circles, ammo icon and Loading/Saved) disappear, just like if I was in the menu.

This happens often when I use crossbow.

Also, if I&#39;m really correct, in HL2, all HUD elements are hidden when in menu, but in BM I can see health, armor and ammo counters.</description>
