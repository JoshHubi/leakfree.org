    <description>As some of you know, I recently upgraded my graphics card to ATI sapphire HD 3850, but i was running 230watts through it so my framerate on TF2 was from 20 to 40, drops to 5 to 10 at some points, i just pumped 500watts into the graphics card (It needs 450) and my framerate is now 20 to 30, anyone know what is happening here?
EDIT: The game [b]looks[/b] smoother to me though, but this might be a placebo effect
I noticed that my PC takes longer to boot past the bios stage as well
EDIT2: Does it matter that i have two power cables going from PSU into graphics card?</description>

            <p>Take a wall clock<br>
Start 2 wires from its battery</p>
<p>Plug them on your CPU, on some specific pins I forgot</p>
<p>The ticks of the clock will multiply your CPU’s speed.<br>
If you really want to, you can change the gears in your clock to adjust the speed/torque ratio of your CPU</p>
<p>I’m sure google can help you with overclocking</p>

            <p>I used to have a 2.4 pentium4, trust me if you can’t overclock it past 3.2ghz like I used to do, get rid of it and get a core2</p>
<p>Pentium4 plus ep2 engine games = lag. No way around it.</p>

            <p>It’s sounding like CPU limitation more ever post.<br>
Portal doesn’t have a lot of AI going on, and TF2 has like 32 players a lot of time…</p>

            <p>You really think so?<br>
I just overclocked the GPU and it’s running even smoother but FPS seems to tell me it’s between 20 and 40…<br>
EDIT: Portal used to go at 40-60FPS, now it’s 100-200<br>
Left4Dead I can now run on full graphics but is at 20-30 FPS, it used to be at 5FPS on full.<br>
So it does do something, just not with TF2</p>

            <p>It has been a while since I’ve had any hands on with hardware that old, but that could very well be about what to expect. It may be more your CPU limiting you than anything (though running AGP these days is something I have to think back about so far as performance capabilities).<br>
Single core 2.66 P4 is probably your biggest bottleneck at this point.</p>
<p>A 3.0GHz core2 dual core processor with a 3850 can run TF2 at about 35FPS when pumped up to 2560*1600. So the card has the umph to run the game, but your CPU doesn’t.</p>
