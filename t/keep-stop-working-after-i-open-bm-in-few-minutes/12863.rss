            <p>Uninstall windows 8 and install windows 7 SP1 don’t forget to update to the latest DirectX and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0, 2.0SP1 2.5 3.0 4.0 4.5 etc and all the Microsoft .Net runtimes also.</p>
<p>If it still crashes try setting heapsize to half your vram (in steam launch options for BM put -heapsize 512000 (for 1gb vram))</p>

            <p>Flatline is right.  We need system specs (like your graphics card, or your op system).</p>
<ul>
<li>For a start I suggest to uninstall and completely delete Black Mesa, then download and install it again.</li>
<li>Also update your drivers.</li>
</ul>
