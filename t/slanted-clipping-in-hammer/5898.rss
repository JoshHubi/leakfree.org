    <title>Slanted Clipping in Hammer</title>

    <description>How do you clip at a diagonal downward on an object that is diagonal to the grid.

For example in this old picture the bar that runs along the bottom of the tanks and around the room is slanted diagonal to what would be the grid in hammer sometimes but also has slanted cuts up and down. How do you do this since the object is not aligned with the grid you can&#39;t just make a normal diagonal cut.
