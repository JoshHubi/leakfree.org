    <title>I need a new gaming mouse.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-need-a-new-gaming-mouse/8521</link>
    <description>So, my mousewheel is almost dead, and is totally unpredictable right now.

I&#39;m looking for a sturdy gaming mouse, prefereably something under $100, but I&#39;ll take any suggestions. the most important feature that I would like, is something WITHOUT the bloody side-to-side mousewheel buttons. I never use them, and I&#39;m pretty sure that is why mine is broken now.</description>

<p>Current Mouse I am using, This mouse is actually very good for the price. It has 7-Buttons and A DPi switch. The red button is a “fire” button which allows me to place 2 left-clicks in one, this is a real life saver in counter-strike. It basically doubles my speed, and I already click very fast.</p>
<p>It only set me back like 12 smackaroons($12). I haven’t had ‘any’ problems with it, it is well built for the price. The DPi also allows me to make better art in photoshop and gimp.</p>

            <p>Bump for anyone who’s interested, I got the WORKING version a few days ago, and I’m really happy with it.</p>
<p>It fit’s my hand perfectly, and is a good weight. I haven’t played around with the sensitivity settings much yet, but I’m happy with the double mouse buttons on the side. I got to try out a G500 a little while ago, and I like these side buttons better.</p>

            <p>It turned out not to bad, the internet has been down for five days (the night before I got the mouse actually) So it really wouldn’t have served much purpose over that time anyways. I should hopefully have another one by monday.</p>

<p>Sorry, internet was down here.</p>
<p>I love the way it feels, its a really comfortable mouse. Unfortunately, I got it from NCIX, so that means I have to RMA it back and get a working version. Within an hour the rightmouse button sunk down into the mouse and started sticking like unbelieveable. It isn’t nessesarily the mouse type though, when I built my computer, I had to send the motherboard back because it plain didn’t work, when we were building my mom’s computer, we had to send the power supply back because it died within the week, it’s just sort of a little tradition we have with NCIX where we order stuff, they send us crap and then send us the good version after. Their customer service is top notch though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>This is the new mouse i’m using.</p>
<p>Best feature that I think you will like is that the mouse wheel is very heavy. In fact the wheel is a cylinder of aluminum. Other cool features include 6 profiles, and 3 on the fly speed setting that you can configure. Plus a neat sniper button that on command sets the DPI to a set level and returns once released. (Handy in Photoshop for precision editing as well as head shots)</p>
<p>Buttons/macros/profiles can be reconfigured in the manager <a href="https://i.imgur.com/arL5I.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">p1</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PgjjS.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">p2</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hfFOl.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">p3</a></p>
<p>I’ve been happy with the results of it so far. I purchased it a few months ago.</p>

<p>im satisfied with that. everything is completely adjustable. the DPI can be turned up or down at the click of the a button which is handy on certain games.<br>
to bad mines 2011 &gt; i wouldnt mind changing the colour to match the keyboard.</p>

<p>The only issue I’ve ever had with either (I too, have owned both since their respective inceptions) is the fabric sheath on the cord fraying and coming apart. It’s still heatshrinked underneath though so it doesn’t hurt anything but aesthetics. I’ve put both through countless fits of rage, they hold up beautifully.</p>

<p>They definitely are.  I wouldn’t recommend one unless you do a lot of stuff that needs a lot of buttons that are easy to reach quickly without having to move away from WASD.  So basically MMOs and possibly mapping, modeling, photoshop, etc.</p>
<p>I hope the Sentinel works out for you, that thing does look quite nice.</p>

            <p>Reading through this thread I just noticed that I have those mouse wheel side to side buttons as well  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  .</p>
<p>I’m using an Alienware Tactx mouse and it works for me. Has two buttons on the left side of it. I probably don’t know all the features (like I said, I didn’t even realize it had the sideways moving mousewheel), though.</p>
<p>Edit: Seems to have some pretty bad reviews though…</p>

            <p>^Awesome.</p>
<p>I’ve ordered the Sentinel, all my other experiences with coolermaster have been good, and it is a good price. I’ll let you all know how I like it in a few days when it comes in.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your help!</p>
<p>This doesn’t neeed to die though, I wouldn’t mind hearing more about other people’s mouse preferences and why.</p>

            <p>Rot, there is a mesh on the top yes, but right underneath it there’s a layer of plastic, then the led below it. So, no, there’s not any dirt actually getting into the mouse if that’s what you’re getting at, although my one has a very mild buildup of dust in the holes. Specks that’re only noticeable if you squint closely, and then see stars for the next few minutes because you were looking right at the led if you’ve seen the promotional pictures there are lights in the front too either side of the braided cable. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>As for the controls;</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
(mine came with shattered horizon, that’s before I customized the display)</p>
<p>The two behind the scrollwheel control the 4-step presets for dpi; Mine are 1200by1200, 2000by2000, 4000by4000, and 5600by5600. The presets are customiseable by using the button on the nose of the mouse. Hold that and it lets you edit in 100dpi indrements.</p>
<p>pressing that nose button lets you switch between 5 different profiles, each with their own dpi settings. The buttons on the side are your normal forwards/back in explorer and internet browsers.</p>
<p>I chose not to install the software, and set them up to store on the mouse, but what I used of it there’s an insane amount of different presets that can be assigned for the buttons. Buuuuuut unfortunately it only has the 5 facebuttons, left, right, thumb buttons and click mousewheel. The three dpi ones aren’t programmable.</p>
<p>It also has 5x4.6 gram weights at the back of the mouse, and the wheel has a nice notchy feel.</p>

            <p>Rot Im not 100% but I believe you can set it to anything, even if not you still have 2 more thumb buttons to use for that. But as I have said before the pure options with it is what makes it so good, changing angles of thumb, slide forwards/backwards 3 back parts and 3 pinky rests/right-sides.</p>

            <p>I dont like the feel of the G500, would recommend the Asus GX800, sits well in the hand, and the forward and back keys is up and down on the side instead for forward and back, its much better when one gets used to it, i have given it quite a beating but still works <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

            <p>Were you testing bunker bombs on it? O_o My G15 has withstood the most rage inducing game experience known to man(APB:R), and lived through it without a scratch.</p>
<p>EDIT: And siggs, I notice that Sentinel has the coolermaster mesh on the back of it, is it going to be a pain in the ass to clean out?</p>

            <p>Ha, That’s the same amount of time that I’ve had my G5. Isn’t the G500 supposed to be a direct upgrade to the G5 though?</p>
