    <title>Remake of Half Life Opposing Force</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/remake-of-half-life-opposing-force/9322</link>
    <description>I think that after they are done with making Black Mesa Source they should remake Half Life Opposing Force in the Future! Half Life Opposing Force was one of my Favorite Half Life&#39;s and they should make it with the same Source engine they did with Black Mesa Source. Who else agree&#39;s with me?  :slight_smile:</description>
