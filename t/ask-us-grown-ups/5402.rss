    <title>Ask us grown-ups</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ask-us-grown-ups/5402</link>
    <description>It doesn&#39;t take a fully developed, post-pubescent brain to know that a lot of you guys &#39;round here are still relatively wet behind the ears.  As was revealed in one of the 2 or 3 recent not-so-subtle &quot;post your age&quot; threads, there&#39;s also a number of us who are big, strong adults who cramp your style and pull our pants up way too high and such.  Instead of telling you to go to your room, however, I think we should use this place to answer any questions you young-uns may have about life as an adult.  So, if you&#39;re a minor, ask away!  If you&#39;re required by law to start filing tax returns, answer away!

So, let&#39;s get some questions!</description>

</aside>
<p>Well, I must admit, “best post ever” does carry quite a significant meaning.  But as you mentioned, it was a clever crafting of useful knowledge, humor, and, no offense of course, but I found great amusement in the British slang  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .  And I highly doubt Guinness will ever glance at these forums.</p>

<p>First, best post ever, you win the Internet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Second, I honestly missed the Brian Eno line until I quoted you.</p>
<p>Third, I agree (from experience) with the careful, honest discussion and open ears.  Talk to each other, and more importantly, LISTEN to each other.  Have been with my girlfriend for 4 years (half living together) and while we’ve discussed the concept of marriage, we both know we’re not going to do it right now.  I generally hate clichés but here’s one for you - Live, Laugh, Love, Listen.  Oh, and unless it’s your thing, don’t try partner-hunting in a pub - folks that go there habitually are usually there for a reason (and that’s a reason for you to NOT be there  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>

<p>I was going out with my girlfriend (now wife) for four years before we got married. For 3 and a bit of those we were living together. I’d say that it’s not just enough to be going out for a decent length of time; you need to be able to commit enough to share resources, body odour, morning breath and all that “married” stuff.</p>
<p>Actually, on reflection, it’s probably more that you need to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>commit to sharing resources, body odour, morning breath <span class="bbcode-i">and</span>
</li>
<li>(more importantly) be able to gently tell her that <span class="bbcode-i">x</span> habit of hers annoys you.</li>
<li>(even more importantly) be able to handle her not so apparently gently telling you that <span class="bbcode-i">x, y</span> <span class="bbcode-b">and</span> <span class="bbcode-i">z</span> habits of yours annoy her (and be man enough to take it on the chin).</li>
<li>(most importantly of all) be able to resolve the above minor quibbles without major atmospheres &amp; soundtracks. (If you can do that, you’re likely to be better at surviving <span class="bbcode-i">proper</span> arguments about stuff that actually matters!)</li>
</ul>
<p>[COLOR=‘Black’] either that or you just don’t need to be listening to Brian Eno while arguing…</p>

<p>My brother’s been in a relationship for nearly 6 years and hasn’t proposed. Mainly because he’s a PhD student and has no money. […] It’s just a huge expense</p>

</aside>
<p>It doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to be a huge expense…</p>
<p>Sure, if you’re wanting to get your friends along, feed them, provide drinks (even just the wine for the meal) provide some entertainment and host it somewhere other than your mum’s sitting room, there’s significant potential for a wedding day to cost a big arse-whack of money… You don’t have to take all the rubbish in those wedding magazines as a recommended shopping list though!</p>
<p>When I got married, the average outlay for a wedding (all stuff included) was about £16,000 in England… We naturally figured that spending enough to buy a brand new hatchback on a <span class="bbcode-i">single</span> day (very special, granted, but still) was madness. I think we managed to knock close to £10K off that figure - by looking for good deals, haggling a bit, doing some stuff ourselves, getting a couple of decent photographer friends to get snap happy (that alone saved £1,500 on a photographer… seriously!).</p>
<p>Friends and family are usually remarkably forthcoming with help &amp; skills (you can save a further £1,500-£5,000 if friends/family are handy with a sewing machine - bridal gowns are eye-bleedingly expensive if you don’t want to hire/buy a pikey meringue from your local kwik-e-mart).</p>
<p>Oh, and (if it’s humanly possible) don’t tell any hire venue/supplier that it’s a wedding they’re bidding for until after they’ve given you a price in writing and can’t wriggle out of it… It seemed to me that the word “Wedding” carries a 10x multiplier hidden in micro-print in the dot of the “i”!</p>

<p>Like, 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Actually, I’d suggest you wait longer.  Most of the marriage disaster stories I’ve heard of seem to have started with a marriage beginning after like, 1 year of seeing each other.  Like you already experienced, 1 year doesn’t really give you enough time or information to really make that decision reliably.  I’d say give it a few years at least.  [color=black]Also stick it in her pooper.</p>
