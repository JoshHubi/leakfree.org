    <title>Flashlight doesnt work</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/flashlight-doesnt-work/9853</link>
    <description>Odd problem with the flashlight on my computer. Most of the time turning the flashlight on and off will have no visible effect. Some objects in game will react correctly and appear brighter when the flashlight is pointed at them, most objects though simply act like the flashlight isnt on.

OS: Windows 7 pro 64-bit
CPU: Athlon II X2 2.8ghz
RAM: 2GB
GPU: Nvidia 7600GS

My GPU is on the old side but I&#39;ve never had a problem with lighting in any of the source games so I doubt its the problem.</description>

            <p>Same problem here, installing new nVidia drivers (306.23) solves this problem, but messes up all shadows in game (see <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=493019" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">THIS</a> topic). Looks like we need to wait for another nVidia drivers which fixes both problems or wait for a word from BM developers.</p>
