    <description>Sorry if this isn&#39;t the right place to ask about this.

This is something that popped up into my mind recently.

I&#39;ve been wondering whether the M16 rifle is considered to be added at some point in the game (unless it&#39;s something that was decided very long ago and the answer was no). I remember some discussions about it in the past, but I don&#39;t know the outcome.

If it still is a possibility, I was thinking about an inventory system (or Loadout more precisely) of sorts, similar to what is seen in CS:GO, where it could be selected and it will replace the MP5.</description>

            <p>Odd, I didn’t notice that when I was going through the weapon mods on the workshop - only the sound one.</p>
<p>Well, there you go - It’s been done, and it’s up on the workshop, so you can just subscribe to that and get the M4.</p>

            <p>The M16/M4 was going to be in the game as an optional replacement for the Mp5, like the HL1 HD pack. It was scrapped during development of the mod version since it wasn’t a big priority. Someone could make one and upload it to the workshop as a mod to replace the Mp5, and I’m actually surprised that it  hasn’t happened yet.</p>
