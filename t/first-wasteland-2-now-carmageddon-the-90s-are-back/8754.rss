    <title>First wasteland 2, now carmageddon? The 90&#39;s are back!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/first-wasteland-2-now-carmageddon-the-90s-are-back/8754</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m sure a lot of you have known about Wasteland 2 being on kickstarter,
but the EXTREMELY WONDERFUL NEWS is that Stainless Games have put their Carmageddon: Reincarnation on kickstarter as well!

Here&#39;s the link if you&#39;re interested [url]https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stainlessgames/carmageddon-reincarnation[/url]

It has actually been in some kind of development process for a year our so, and they say they&#39;ll release it in February 2013 via steam if they reach the goal!

Attention all competitors: This is your one minute warning. 
Ah, memories.</description>

            <p>Try playing Carmageddon 2 : Carpocalypse now. I found it even better. It’s not just an update version though, it’s a brand new game.</p>
