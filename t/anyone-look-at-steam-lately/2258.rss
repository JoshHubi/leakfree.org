<p>I love steam. I just bought Audiosurf for myself and two friends. I was tallying up all the games I’ve purchased for myself and friends, and I have paid only 30% of what I would have paid at full price at the time the game was on sale. I’ve paid an average of $3.15 a game for the 26 games I’ve purchased since I got Steam, and most of those games are Valve titles.</p>

            <p>I love steam. I just bought Audiosurf for myself and two friends. I was tallying up all the games I’ve purchased for myself and friends, and I have paid only 30% of what I would have paid at full price at the time the game was on sale. I’ve paid an average of $3.15 a game for the 26 games I’ve purchased since I got Steam, and most of those games are Valve titles.</p>

            <p>Just bought Mirror’s Edge for 5 doll-hairs, and will most likely not even be compared to Black Mesa in awesomeness, which is also totally free.</p>
<p>Its funny. I will always think about that when I buy games. Black Mesa ftw!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Stalker is awesome. I love it. But Clear Sky keeps crashing on my PC. It’s not the games fault though. Every 3d game crashes this PC. I wish I knew why…</p>
