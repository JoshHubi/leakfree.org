    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-if-the-marines-would-fight-only-the-aliens-not-the-bmrf-personal-too/12457</link>
    <description>Well my opinion is:
Together the 2 forces could stand against the aliens. Freeman would get easy to the Lambda complex and who knows maybe A. Shephard would be with him on xen against the Nihilanth. With the Xen forces defeated and with the combined power of BM personnel and HECU the Race X would be push back to their world beyond worlds. Becouse of this succes The Black Ops would not try to  destroy the facility.
But still the Combine would invade us trough the portal storms right ? Or the scientists in the facility would stop them before the Universal Union could invade us ?

That was the fictious opinion.
My real opinion is: If the HECU would help you and not try to kill you... well Half-Life 1 would be a shitty game without future !  :slight_smile: )</description>

            <p>“So, what was that guy saying was happening? That this is a military coverup? What is he smoking? Does he realize how impractical that would be? This facility’s huge! We must hire almost a thousand people. You can’t track down every single-- And aliens! We’ve got aliens popping up out of nowhere. Think people won’t notice that? What are they going to do, say they’re all mutant prairie dogs? Shoot everyone in New Mexico?” –<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVmvVKRY290" data-bbcode="true">Freeman’s Mind, Episode 14</a></p>

            <p>I guess the history would be totally different, what if a Marine killed a scientist with a brilliant idea to stop the invasion.</p>
<p>Like no no they are doing it wrong and BAM killed</p>
<p>There is a scientist who says something like this, just before getting killed…</p>
<p>So I guess when the Marines are on our side, there is no invasion anymore…</p>

            <p>I don’t really think it would make a difference.<br>
Its basicilly the same, only you got help from the U.S military.Aside from that, working together wont change the fact that there was a portalstorm, and a fight with the combine.</p>

Together the 2 forces could stand against the aliens. Freeman would get easy to the Lambda complex and who knows maybe A. Shephard would be with him on xen against the Nihilanth.
