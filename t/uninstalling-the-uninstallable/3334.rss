    <title>Uninstalling the uninstallable</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/uninstalling-the-uninstallable/3334</link>
    <description>So, heres the problem. I have 2 &#39;main&#39; hard drives, one with steam/windows and the other with all other games on it. When the 2nd one crashed a while ago I obviously lost all my games and recently went to reinstall one. Gears of War if you must know. However I guess its still in the registry on the 1st drive, and thinks that its still installed, so uninstalling with add/remove programs gives me a a missing file error and putting the disk in gives me play and uninstall options, both return an error. Have googled around, most solutions either involve registry editing (not my favorite option) or uninstalling the original program, which is what I&#39;m trying to do.

TL;DR, how do I re-install something that thinks its still installed?</description>

            <p>Haha, that’s a good point… but while a vacuum cleaner may be good for crumbs and dust, it can’t pick up or fold your socks! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Just wanted to point out that sometimes manually editing the registry really is unavoidable, when there aren’t any programs out there to fix the specific problem that’s occurring.  (And sometimes they don’t detect and clean up the entire mess.)  Although, you’re right, this particular case doesn’t sound too messy.  I think it should be pretty obvious to CCleaner or most any other competent registry-fixer-upper to detect the missing game files and clean the registry accordingly.</p>
<p>Oh, also, something I forgot to mention earlier to the OP: If you do go the CCleaner route, make sure to scan the registry and clean it <span class="bbcode-i">multiple times.</span>  As it turns out, deleting broken registry keys can break other registry keys, which all need to be fixed in turn.  Just keep scanning, backing up, and deleting the broken keys until CCleaner doesn’t detect any more problems.  You shouldn’t have to scan more than 3 or 4 times before everything that CCleaner can detect has been fixed.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yeah, I find picking up garbage, hair, lint, food crumbs and such off the floor is way better than using a vacuum cleaner.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I second the motion for CCleaner.  It has a bunch of options for removing old temporary files, and for scanning the registry, backing it up, and then deleting the broken parts that no longer point to any valid files (could be handy with this missing GoW situation you’re having, I think).</p>
<p>If that doesn’t fix it, I also second the motion for manually editing the registry.  Manually editing the registry can only make it worse if you really (and I mean really) screw something up, and even then it won’t necessarily result in a totally unfixable situation.  It’s really not that difficult, just as long as you’re careful and make sure to back edited keys up by right clicking them, and then clicking Export, before changing them.</p>
<p>The first places to look for latent footprints of uninstalled programs would be in the software branches (always, always look there first).  There are two main software branches, one for your current User, and one for the Machine as a whole.  They’re located under “HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software” and “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software”.  Browsing these trees and finding programs in there should be fairly self-explanatory.  It only gets a bit tricky (in my experience) when Microsoft is involved (go figure  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) because the Software/Microsoft key is somewhat disorganized, IMHO.  (Most common Windows-related stuff will be located under Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion, if you’re curious – just FYI.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">At any rate, as far as Gears of War is concerned, I googled a bit, and it seems that it should be located under either “HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Microsoft Games/Gears of War” or “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Microsoft Games/Gears of War”, so you might have a look there, maybe try deleting those keys if they still exist (back them up first, just in case!) and see if that fixes your problem by rerunning the installer.</span></p>
<p>Another good place to look for remaining registry keys after an uninstall fails, would be under “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall”.  Most Add and Remove Programs should be located here.  The keys (folders) themselves are kind of illegible (most are GUIDs) but you can still easily identify a program in this particular list by opening one of the GUID keys, and taking note of the “DisplayName” value in the right hand pane – DisplayName shows the program as it appears in Add and Remove Programs.  Personally, I don’t actually recommend removing broken add/remove program entries yourself if you’re not confident with the registry yet, especially since CCleaner has a feature to remove broken Add/Remove entries built in already – it makes it really easy (another reason to give CCleaner a shot, if you haven’t yet!)</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the lengthy post – hope that helps at least somewhat, if at all. Hope you find a fix for your problem soon!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">tl;dr - I second the vote for trying CCleaner!</span> (Can’t vouch for Revo Uninstaller, I’ve never used it myself.) Good luck!</p>

            <p>CCleaner is good, but seriously… if you know what you’re doing in the registry, you can almost always be more efficient in the cleanup if you do it manually.<br>
If you’re worried, make a reg backup or a system restore point.</p>

<p>ontopic: ccleaner all the way - has registry scan, is free, easy, and doesnt require tedious searching in the reg folder yourself. in the minutes saved you can make yourself a sandwich or something. awesome!</p>

            <p>I had a problem with google installer one time so I went through the registry and tried deleting stuff in there.</p>
<p>Only to find out from google support that not all of the registry stuff for that particular program had a label that would have been easily found.  So basically, I made it worse by trying to manually delete the registry stuff.</p>

            <p>Out of curiousity what happens if you use explorer to go into the disk, find the “setup.exe” and run that? (Likely an already installed error, but worth a try)</p>

            <p>I still prefer regedit, you can even use the search feature if you’re uber lazy. It’s so easy, just press ctrl+f and type whatever your program is called, then F3 to find the next entry to delete all of them.</p>
