    <title>Current Favorite Game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/current-favorite-game/6301</link>
    <description>What game have you been playing the most recently and why?

For me, BFBC2. Holy shit do I love this game. Best 7 dollars I have ever spent in my entire life. 22 including the Vietnam expansion. My absolute favorite part of BFBC2 is getting the M40 medium-long range sniping. Sniping is sooo incredibly satisfying especially when you get an incredible headshot. Unfortunately, the vehicles in &#39;Nam are absurdly overpowered. The helicopter can be constantly healed while flying. And the Humvees are really inaccurate while moving so they gave them a really strong turret, but people just park their Humvee somewhere and massacre everyone. Also, I would absolutely LOVE a theater mode for BFBC2 so I can relive and show off all my incredibly snipes.</description>

            <p>My current favourite game would have to be Split Second for the sheer fun of it. I’m not great at driving games with a pad (and I can’t afford a decent wheel and pedals and seat), but once you’ve unlocked 3 or 4 cars you get to the ones that handle nicely, the tracks are almost all well laid out, and the AI is hard but fair (i.e. if you do well and stay at the front, you won’t come last because of EVIL BLUE B@STARD SHELLS),</p>

<p>Same. It’s mindblowing just how massively better it is than the original and the original was very good already.</p>

            <p>Oddly enough my current favourite game would probably be SCII.</p>
<p>I say oddly as I haven’t played the game since it came out, but I’ve been watching the GSL League matches with commentary non stop. It’s such a great game to watch with commentators who know what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Some great matches in GSL Season 3, including a 40 minute match!!!</p>
<p>In terms of games being played, Borderlands or ME1/2 would be the favourite atm.</p>

<p>BFBC2 is awsome, but that PBL bulls**t needs to end now or that game is going to collect dust next to NFS Shift(that Nurburgring hackenheim corner is impossible!). Which reminds me, I should go get Hot Pursuit &amp; see how awsome DICE &amp; Criterion made that.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I really wish they had put a little more work into the vehicles.</p>
<p>NFSHP is pretty cool. My one problem with it is there are WAAYYYY too many time trials. I play HP to beat the shit out of other cars, not to race against time like in every other racing game ever made.</p>
