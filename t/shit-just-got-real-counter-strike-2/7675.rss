<p>No, I’m not saying COD is better. In COD, it feels like I’m shooting a card board cut out instead of an actual person.</p>

<p>Read the comments.</p>
<p>Those idiots are so fucking self-centered they completely ignore the fact that non-competitive players also like to play CS for fun.</p>
<p>Basically they want Valve to get on their knees and suck their dicks off while attending to their every need.</p>
<p>If they’re so fucking smart and think they know better, why don’t they just make their own perfect CS clone and play that instead?</p>
<p>It’s incredible that these pricks have actually managed to keep CS from evolving beyond its core format because of their bloated sense of self-importance.</p>

            <p>In all honesty I’m pretty sure VALVe is going to tweak some weapon perks here and there, maybe switch up the gameplay so that Consoles have a chance.<br>
But they’ll most likely going to keep true to just regular old-<span class="bbcode-i">Counter-Strike</span>.</p>
<p>The re-done maps also look exceptional.</p>
<p>Good job VALVe. And good luck.</p>

            <p>I dont mean to be critical or sound like some whiny rat but, from watching the trailer it looks like what CoD :MW2 was for CoD :MW.</p>
<p>Seriously, just redone maps,models and same gameplay?? I thought they were going to change the gameplay completely and mimicking the CoD style e.g. iron sights, weapon updates etc etc</p>

            <p>You know, ironically enough, about a month or two ago I was debating with a friend of mine about whether or not I should get MW3 or BF3. Somehow we got onto the topic of how successful VALVe would be if they ported Counter-Strike to the consoles.</p>
<p>Well sure enough, a month or so later, here I am.</p>
<p>I’m genuinely interested to see how well this is going to play out.</p>

<p>More models for detail, more models in general. Better optimized brushwork… I’ll buy it for the gameplay if I’ll buy it.</p>

            <p>It’s going to be XBLA?  I may actually give it a shot then, instead of instapassing on it.</p>
<p>I need to download Reboot sometime.  Because it would be ridiculously expensive to buy all three seasons and two movies.  (though it would be totally worth it)</p>

            <p>Reboot was the shit. I still hum the firewall to myself any time I see the word.</p>
<p>And the game obviously looks a lot better than CSS. Huge improvements. It doesn’t look as good as a lot of modern games, but it’s not a full-sized release. It’s an XBLA/PSN/Steam-only game.</p>
