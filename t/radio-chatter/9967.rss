    <description>Why did you do that, change the radio chatter for Christian Bale&#39;s Batman voice!?

Or is it something they will add later?

            <p>The first HECU at the cliffside sequence kept saying ‘Do it’ all the time when I first entered that area through the pipe. He became bugged and said it about 5-7 times in a row, felt like he wanted me to jump to my death.</p>

<p>One of the worst lines I heard in the game; especially the heavy breathing afterwards that makes him sound like he was on roid-rage. Honestly the first notice of the military (‘Now under military control’) was a fairly atmospheric moment and probably the most awesome moment to me. It gave a sense of danger without blatantly making them out as the bad-guy.</p>

<p>I always assumed it was just a baiting tactic, in that they are trying to taunt you into doing something stupid so they can take you out when you make an irrational move (walking into the open, charging at a squad, etc).</p>
<p>Obviously it doesn’t actually work like that, but I think that’s the logic behind the dialogue.</p>

<p>By the way, I wouldn’t mind a “mod” that would replace the soldiers’ voices with something that sounds more like a stereotypical soldier and cooler. I just don’t like how they acted it. Some of the soldiers sound gay to me, even. Especially the way they say “sir”.</p>

<p>partly for humor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>“Humour” is probably by far the biggest problem I have with Black Mesa.</p>
<p>That aside, I don’t actually mind the marines. They sound a lot younger, which does kind of make sense for soldiers (the old ones sounded like they were in their 40s), plus that one voice actor who keeps showing up and sounding psychotic does sort of make a lot of the plot points make more sense. For instance, the “I killed 12 of those dumbass scientists and not one of them fought back! This sucks!!!” You can tell the guy joined the force because he wanted to kill people and get in shootouts, so it makes sense he wouldn’t think twice about gunning down civilians.</p>
<p>The overacting helps in places, but it hurts in places when it changes the context of what they say. For instance, the original line from On a Rail where two marines are wondering if Freeman caused all this says “Yeah, maybe. All I know is he’s been killing my buddies!” The original acts like he couldn’t give a toss who Freeman is, but he killed Marines and you don’t do that. The Black Mesa Marine in the same situation is like “Yeah… Maybe!” like he only just now put it together and it’s a big revelation. Neither is right or wrong, but this is where overacting hurts more than it helps because this scene really worked better with a flat tone.</p>
<p>What I miss the most, though, is the “radio” part of radio chatter. What we hear in Black Mesa are Marines mumbling from under a gas mask, but we’re hearing them directly. What we used to hear in Half-Life is their conversations over cheap push-to-talk radios with the accompanying static marking button presse and release and the voice modulation from low audio quality. I don’t know, I’ve always been a fan of ye olde radio. It’s what made the intro to the original StarCraft feel much more like sci-fi than the rest of the game.</p>
<p>I don’t mind what’s there. It has its high points and its low points, but Black Mesa’s Marine chatter does the job and has its own moments of greatness.</p>
