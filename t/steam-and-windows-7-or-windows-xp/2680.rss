    <title>Steam and Windows 7 or Windows XP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-and-windows-7-or-windows-xp/2680</link>
    <description>I am a firm believer in NOT paying to be a beta tester for Mr. Gates however due to my recent computer issues, a question has been posed to me that I am hard pressed to answer.

If you had a choice to install a fresh copy of Windows 7 or Windows XP on your brand new hard drive, which would you choose?

Does Windows 7 offer issues with steam?</description>

            <p>Windows 7 runs steam fine. However there is a problem to note. When you compile a large map in Hammer, vrad sometimes freezes; about once every 10 times. This is probably due to 64 bit operating system, or not, IDK. Valve will probobly offer support for this in the future. As for steam and steam game there is no problems.</p>

            <p>I am rather sure I solved the permission/access problem by doing what burb said.  But I believe I messed a couple other things up and figured now was a good time to “start over” if ever there was a time.  So I put in the windows 7 installation to start over.</p>
<p>I am still getting the rest of the updates for 7, but now when I open “my computer” it is not seeing my alternate cd drive or my old hard drive.</p>

            <p>Microsoft changed the way permissions are assigned to drives/files/folders somewhere between XP and 7.  Thus, like Lord Grievous said, XP can access certain files that Vista and 7 say, “No!” to.</p>
<p>This is especially evident in personalized or system folders, such as Documents, Users, Application Data, and so forth.</p>
<p>The steps listed by Burbinator should have solved your access problems, as it <em>should</em> extend your permission rights to every file on the drive.  If, however, you still encounter access denials on a regular basis, copying the files to a new directory (i.e. moving the files from within My Documents to a new folder called Old Files) from within another operating system (such as Linux or XP) should alleviate the remaining issues.</p>
<p>I think.</p>

            <p>It probably has to do something with the fact that the old harddrive still has its OS on it, so some things are being protected by its settings, which may or may not be interpreted incorrectly by the new OS.</p>
<p>That’s really flimsy techspeak for… for… something I can’t quite put my finger on.</p>

<p>I purchased a small hard drive for booting and holding the windows 7, and then my old hard drive is now my E drive which has My Documents, My Programs, My home videos, etc. and all that.

<p>All seems to be well, except for some reason there are permission issues with some of the files in my old harddrive.  Example, I click on my documents/blackmesa and while I can access the blackmesacoversboxart, I could not access the blackmesafaces. I got an error that said “you don’t currently have permission to access this folder”. I continue and get “you have been denied permission to access this folder. to gain access to this folder you will need to use the security tab.” of which I use the security tab to reassign ownership.  Now I can access it.</p>
<p>Problem… there are hundreds of files spread out in the old hard drive that I dont have access to.  Some of them let me move ownership to me, others do not.  Is there an easy way to tell it to give me ownership to everything in the harddrive?</p>

            <p>First:<br>
Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts -&gt; Change User Account Control settings: put the slider down to Never Notify</p>
<p>Second:<br>
Go to Security Tab of the Properties of your HD.<br>
First take ownership:<br>
Advanced -&gt; Owner -&gt; Edit -&gt; Choose your username (add if needed) -&gt; Click OK in every window, including Properties.</p>
<p>Then take permissions:<br>
Security tab in Properties again:<br>
Edit -&gt; Choose your username (add if needed) -&gt; tick Allow for Full control -&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>This should take ownership of the entire HD, if I’m not mistaken.</p>

            <p>Like I said, make sure UAC is off (read above post), and it should shut about half of those messages up.</p>
<p>Er, sorry, Black Mesa stopped responding, didn’t see your edit.  I’m trying to think what the problem is.  Uh…  did you try right clicking “My Documents” and making sure it wasn’t read-only?</p>

            <p>It would seem there is a two teir problem.  On one hand I have to tell the file that I am an administrative user that is allowed to see the security permissions for the file. To do this I have to take ownership of the file. Once done, I then I can see the security permissions and notice that my group or username is not listed in the permissions area.  Yeah, I can add myself as a user that has permission but we are talking about a 12 click process to put “everyone” in as someone with permissions to the file.</p>
<p>And I have thousands of files on my old hard drive of which any number may decide I do not have access or permissions.</p>
<p>FUCK</p>

<p>That doesnt give me access and permission to edit/move/update/change or whatnot to all files in My Documents.</p>

            <p>I have no issues with Windows 7 and Steam. My hardware is from the early days of XP and they all work perfectly.</p>

            <p>Had the same issues when I first switched to Windows7, asking permissions and denying me permission. I’m not sure what I did to resolve it, but I just started playing with the options under the advanced section of the gain permissions thing. It kept me entirely out of my music section for a while though. I was not pleased to say the least. They eventually go away, but until they do its annoying.</p>

            <p>Make sure you have full administrative privileges…  And turn off User Access Control, if you can.  It causes more problems than its worth.  (Just search User Access Control in the start menu, I believe that will point you in the right direction)</p>

<p>All seems to be well, except for some reason there are permission issues with some of the files in my old harddrive.  Example, I click on my documents/blackmesa and while I can access the blackmesacoversboxart, I could not access the blackmesafaces. I got an error that said “you don’t currently have permission to access this folder”. I continue and get “you have been denied permission to access this folder. to gain access to this folder you will need to use the security tab.” of which I use the security tab to reassign ownership.  Now I can access it.</p>
<p>Problem… there are hundreds of files spread out in the old hard drive that I dont have access to.  Some of them let me move ownership to me, others do not.  Is there an easy way to tell it to give me ownership to everything in the harddrive?</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not sure (I only just got 7 with my new computer) but you may be able to change the permissions of the entire HDD</p>
