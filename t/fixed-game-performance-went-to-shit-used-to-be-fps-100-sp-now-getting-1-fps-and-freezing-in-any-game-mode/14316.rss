    <title>[FIXED]Game performance went to shit, used to be fps &gt; 100 SP, now getting 1 fps and freezing in any game mode.</title>

    <description>So, I have a GTX 750 TI, and have been running the game perfectly up until now.  For the past few days, the game is always trying to sync with the cloud and download workshop content, but doesn&#39;t download anything.  When I go to play, I get 1 fps, like I&#39;m literally running it off a potato and not a $500 gaming pc.   I&#39;ll try verifying the cache, and will update if that helps.

EDIT:  Validating the cache actually helped in this case. I wish it crashed so I could give you a file, all I know is 2 files needed to be redownloaded.  Sorry for the lack of evidence or ability to replicate this.</description>
