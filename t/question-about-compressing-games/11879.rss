    <title>Question about Compressing Games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/question-about-compressing-games/11879</link>
    <description>I noticed Black Mesa had a unique and efficient way of being distributed.  The game (as we all know by know, hopefully) came in a regular folder holding both a .exe and a .7z zip file so the downloader could choose his installation method.  It also came with a .md5 file the verify that the game was legitimate.  The best part was that the .exe extracted the zip file.  How did they achieve this?  I tried googling it but had no luck.  I&#39;d like to use this for future projects.

And sorry if this isn&#39;t the best place to post this.  Didn&#39;t want to post this in Black Mesa since this pertains to other mods/games too.


Thanks  :wink:</description>

            <p>I think they should release (or some fan should make) a stand-alone .exe file.</p>

            <p>Or had the installer download the mod itself, but that would have just caused headaches on release day.</p>

            <p>They used <a href="https://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page" data-bbcode="true">Nullsoft</a> for the installer, which is an open-source and highly configurable installer creator.</p>
<p>In this case they chose to have to compressed files in its own file and the exe in another but they could’ve put the whole thing in a single exe file if they wanted.</p>
