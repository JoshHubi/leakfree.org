    <description>Hey everyone,

First of all, this isn&#39;t a &quot;when will it be released&quot; or anything question, so please don&#39;t burn this thread to the ground   :smiley:  
I was just wondering, when will we be albe to pre-order the Steam release of BM on Steam? I don&#39;t care if it will take another year or two to be released after it would be released on Steam for pre-order, I just want to pre-order it so I can just wait untill the mod get&#39;s released on Steam without having to spend money a couple of days before the release. I&#39;m sure the devs would appriciate the money at this stage.

Anyway, thank you so much for the mod, it&#39;s just a piece of art, and I&#39;m patiently waiting for Multiplayer and Xen.</description>
