            <p>Amusingly all the Chinese here have stopped eating cucumbers because they are scared of the outbreak in Europe.</p>
<p>I mean, WTF?  They don’t even import cucumbers from Europe.<br>
Also, at least 90% of what they eat is hazardous to health and far more deadly than the cucumbers anyway.<br>
Jeannotvb is right with his remark about MSG, it’s pretty much considered a staple ingredient in anything; kind of like salt.</p>

            <p>Meh, Child’s Play.<br>
China pwns you all when it comes to poisoned food.</p>
<p>I’ve been living here a year and have suffered from more health problems than I have done in all my years combined.</p>
<p>Several bouts of food poisoning.<br>
Odd skin problems.<br>
A stomach ulcer appeared and caused me to vomit and shit 1.5 litres of blood (not fun)<br>
Weird throat infections<br>
Random bleeding out of my ass (unrelated to ulcer, possibly intestinal)</p>
<p>Here’s a few examples of the wonderful world of Chinese food:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Fake Baby Milk</span> which resulted in the deaths of several babies and terrible health problems for hundreds more.<br>
The government pwnd everyone over this.  The company bosses were shot.  The parents of sick babies who complained were imprisoned for ‘causing social disturbance’.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Longkou noodles</span> contained high amounts of lead.<br>
Farmers who wanted to save money made noodles from cornstarch instead of mungbeans.  To make the starch transparent they added a lead based chemical.  WIN</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Soy sauce made from human hair</span></p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>When asking how the amino acid syrup (or powder) was generated, the manufacturer replied that the powder was generated from human hair. Because the human hair was gathered from salon, barbershop and hospitals around the country, it was unhygienic and mixed with condoms, used hospital cottons, used menstrual cycle pad, used syringe, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Fake Medical Drugs</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Sewage Cooking Oil</span><br>
My personal favourite.<br>
When cooking oil becomes unusable most restaurants tip it down the drain.  Some smart people realised that there was money to be made from this and started collecting the cooking oil from the sewers, filtering it and then selling it back to restaurants at discount prices.<br>
The oil is filled with many delicious extras such as lead, magnesium, chemical waste and is highly carcinogenic.  Delicious cancer.<br>
Recently the government has come forward and said that they believe the use of sewer oil to be so profuse that 1 in 10 restaurants use it.  So if you eat out 10 times you are likely to have eaten food cooked in sewage at least once.  I’ve eaten out a lot…:fffuuu:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Sewage used in tofu manufacturing</span><br>
Close to a hundred manufacturers of tofu in Guangdong province were found to use a combination of sewage, slop, and Iron sulfate to accelerate production and improve appearance of their fermented product.  Awesome.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Contaminated baby formula AGAIN</span><br>
This time it killed six babies and made 294,000 sick.</p>
<p>Very recently (in the past few months) there have been reports of chemicals being added to pork to make it taste like beef.  (pigs are cheaper to keep than cows, so if they sell pork disguised as beef they can make a bigger profit)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Exploding Watermelons</span><br>
This was in the news a couple of weeks ago.  Farmers were using growth hormones to make the melons grow bigger but were finding that they were literally exploding in the fields.</p>
<p>If you come to China bring your own lunch.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
