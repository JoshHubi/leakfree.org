    <title>How to use Black Mesa saves in original Half-Life?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-use-black-mesa-saves-in-original-half-life/13248</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I have a little issue, as said in the title. I&#39;m reaching the end of Black Mesa and I want to finish the game in my Steam copy of the original Half Life. But when I copy my saves from the SAVE folder in BMS and past them in the Half-Life folder (Steam\SteamApps\common\half-life\valve) and start the game, my saves are not appearing at all in the game.

Someone has a solution for this?

Thank you</description>

            <p>Black Mesa and Half-Life are two completely different games running on different engines. Saves are not interchangeable because that would make no sense.</p>
<p>It would be almost like trying to run a Half-Life 2 saved game in Half-Life 1.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is a duplicate thread in the wrong forum. I’ll put my reply in the other one.</p>
