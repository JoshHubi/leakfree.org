    <title>How to use Black Mesa saves in original Half-Life?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-use-black-mesa-saves-in-original-half-life/13247</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I have a little issue, as said in the title. I&#39;m reaching the end of Black Mesa and I want to finish the game in my Steam copy of the original Half Life. But when I copy my saves from the SAVE folder in BMS and past them in the Half-Life folder (Steam\SteamApps\common\half-life\valve) and start the game, my saves are not appearing at all in the game.

Someone has a solution for this?

Thank you</description>

            <p>I think BM originally started as an HL2 (Source 2006) mod back in the day with some CS:S assets that were planned to be replaced so that only HL2 would be required to play BM, but then it morphed into a “Lost Coast Tech Demo” mod which is basically a Source 2007 SDK mod which has access to all of Source “shared” assets from HL2, HL2 EP1, CS:S, etc.</p>
<p>BTW, the fact that BM doesn’t require any Source game to play was actually a big surprise to all and it happened when Valve made TF2 free to play which caused Source SDK 2007 to appear in Steam’s “tools” menu for every Steam user by default.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa is a mod for the Source Engine. Half-Life uses the Goldsrc engine. Very different game engines.</p>
<p>Even if the engine were the same, Black Mesa has so much custom content that it’s better to think of it as its own game rather than a mod. And even among mods, it’s rarely possible to interchange saved games anyway.</p>

<p>Since I take pity on you though, here’s how you can load the Xen level in Half-Life 1 without playing through the entire game:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start Half-Life and open up the console by pressing the ‘~’ key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type these commands into the console in order:</p>

<p>You should now be in Xen with all the weapons you need.</p>

<p>EDIT: I just noticed that you said you are REACHING the end of Black Mesa. You should finish Black Mesa first before loading Half-Life to finish everything off.</p>

<p>Ok guys, thank you for your answers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Because of the “mod” status of Black Mesa, I thought saves could be replaced from one to the other.</p>
<p>Once I’ll reach the end of Black Mesa, i’ll try dky.tehkingd.u’s tip.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa and Half-Life are two completely different games running on different engines. Saves are not interchangeable because that would make no sense.</p>
<p>It would be almost like trying to run a Half-Life 2 saved game in Half-Life 1.</p>
