I don&#39;t know if anyone has seen this yet, but motion control SDK and FPS utility has developed, with Valve backing and through steam.

Does this mean motion control for Ep3? Who doesn&#39;t want to [i]actually[/i] crowbar zombies?




Some quotes if you don&#39;t want to read the whole article:

&quot;allowing developers to effortlessly create a totally immersive gaming experience that takes advantage of a full six degrees of motion with ease&quot;

“Our SDK computes its exact position (X-Y-Z) and orientation (pitch-roll-yaw) to the nearest millimeter and degree and reports these values to the game with no shadowing and no drift. In gaming this instant response is the difference between instructing a character to do something and actually being that character,”

“Together with Razer and Sixense, we are designing new, more enjoyable gameplay mechanics in Left 4 Dead 2, as well as future Valve titles.”</description>

            <p>As long as the games don’t singulalrily revolve around motion control and the option to use the tried and true mouse and WASD keys still exists, then I wouldn’t really care.  Just make absolutly sure the games are actual works of quality and are not lame cash grabs.</p>

            <p>Would have to see some video of it… being used by Valve, then, ill think about it. I think the Novint Falcon Pistol Grip is better. Its basically the SAME thing, thats already made, along with better features.</p>
