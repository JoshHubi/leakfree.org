[...] Someone will probably make a BM-DM thread in the future, and we can talk more about it there and then.

Hi!
I guess I have to be the one to make the BMDM thread(not again).

- Write here about what you&#39;d like to see on Black Mesa: Deathmatch.
- Share with us your idea about a new game mode
- Discuss here about multiplayer features that should be in BMDM.
- make a rant against binders, bunny-hoppers, hackers, cheaters  :smiley: (SPUF are stuffed with these)

            <p>BMDM IDEAS<br>
Aliens Vs HECU<br>
I was thinking about a gamemode like this… Sounds really hard to code though, but some gmod mods did it.<br>
Players playing as aliens.<br>
Aliens playable : Bullsquid, Houndeye, Alien grunt , Headcrab,and vorts.<br>
I think Players playing as aliens against players as HECU would be a awesome TDM mode. Just think about it! Features: Aliens can munch on dead bodies. IT regans their health. (thats it). Also, theres 2 modes of this gamemode. Theres 1 where aliens have unlimited lives and HECU has only 1 for each player, or Where both sides have unlimited lives with objectives.</p>
<p>Survival</p>
<hr>
<p>Playing as HECU grunts, a team of 2-8 must hold out waves of XEN creatures.<br>
The last wave is 25. The Boss wave is just 25. It’s the Gauntlala or something. If 1 player dies, and 7 are left, the player that died can respawn next wave. But if about 4 players die on a wave, and theres 4 left, the players that died cannot respawn until 5 waves. If there’s only 1 player left, the game is over. (Unless your doing it by yourself on your own server)</p>
<p>Escape</p>
<hr>
<p>A group of secruity guards or scientist plan to make an escape…You and your friends must battle your way out of blackmesa, with events that can kill you. Like ceilings breaking and impacting you. No respawns on this. The escapes would be: Escape by car, truck, Helicopter, boat, or maybe death.</p>
<p>What I want to see in BMDM: NOOOO BUnnyhopping (I think this has already been annouced</p>
<p>Health for players decreased, unless your playing as a non-human thing or something.</p>
<p>Playable XEN creatures ( W00t my first idea)</p>
<p>Realistic damage (like 2nd one, under no bunnyhopping)</p>
<p>:fffuuu: Byeeee! I hope you add some of these!</p>

<p>about the maps: there are some maps like crossfire that detonates a nuke, this should cause more fear in BMDM, maybe if the player cant respawn for 5 minutes or cannot use better guns for an amount of time after respawn could make the trick and players will truly figth to get to the bunker.</p>

</aside>
<p>Five minutes are a <span class="bbcode-b">HUGE</span> amount of time in multiplayer games…</p>
<p>I’d do something like this:</p>
<p>if the respawn timer is set to 10 sec it would double or 3 times the actual respawn time</p>

<p>Are y’all joking, right?<br>
Do you have an idea about how hard is to achieve?</p>
<p>In terms of coding and physics managment it’s a <span class="bbcode-b">nightmare</span>…</p>
<p>There’s a reason why only Valve made something so crazy, new and awesome…<br>
…and before you’ll ask:<br>
Valve hasn’t released any kind of source of Portal’s code, hence BM devs should start from scratch!</p>
<p>I hate to quote myself but in the OP I said this:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Ok guys!<br>
It’s brainstorming time:<br>
we should suggest to devs some new gamemode(easy to code!).</p>

<p>Please post your ideas but they must be reasonable and above all, doable!</p>

            <p>I always liked Survival Co-Op, i never got a good chance on it because most of them being Zombie Survival-Horror, and i hate Horror.<br>
I Think This Black Mesa Horde Mode should be split to two types, Normal Horde which has the enemies switching and changing with every wave (wave 1: Vortigunts…Wave 2:Hecu and Houndeyes) and Zombie Horde, which is zombie only survival, and we all know Half Life Zombies are not that Scary…</p>

you can  download it  <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/21287700/sotf.rar" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s orange-mapped but I think that give us a taste of what could be a horde mode in Black Mesa</p>

<p>This.<br>
These people who whine about advanced movement still in HL2DM are just mentally obese. Dumbing shit down continually is anti-evolutionary and results in a culture of laziness. Add some depth to this game via CVAR or you’re going to lose a fair number of players and more than a couple of quality mappers.</p>

<p>^This is crap my friend. Killbox FFA played by an ineperienced random? Not even close to what is possible in that game. Sadly Valve has fucked it up via neglect and batch updates, which is something BMDM could avoid.</p>
<p>Besides this CVAR issue I`d personally like to see a good amount of beta testing if possible, to track down stuff like hitreg and physics bugs</p>

a team deathmatch lasts a bit longer.</p>

<p>hl - deathmatch was not designed with that in mind, it was part of emergent gameplay by the players, and it is not necesary to bring it back, Look to BMDM just like the changes from TFC to TF2.</p>

            <p>Gun game is fun. If the BM devs don’t include it as a native mode, someone will mod it, no doubt.</p>
<p>Gun games work better on some maps than others. I don’t know if the devs are so concerned about modding their own game. It’s already a good bit of work to make the game itself. I suspect that they might leave gameplay modes like gun game to the community, but I honestly don’t know. It makes sense to concentrate their time and effort into the game itself, and leave stuff like that to the community.</p>
