            <p>A survival map could certainly be made in Black Mesa, but it’d lack just about everything I’m sure you’re looking for with this, such as inventory and “intuitive” stealth. However, things like needing to find a keycard or a paper with the code on it could certainly be done in some respect, though those sort of things would sorta just be out of place for what’s supposed to be, as you said yourself, a “beautiful version of Half-Life.” No reason a mapper making their own campaign couldn’t do it, though.

<p>Dunno what you’ve been doing, but I’ve managed to gib headcrabs from throwing an empty water cooler jug on them.</p>

<p>That is what CC was trying to achieve you know.  They wanted to overhaull the game while keeping gameplay as close as possible to the original, they might’ve played with the physics a bit here and there but they did not want to make it a crucial part of gameplay unlike half life 2 or add new mechanics like UH.  I mean even multiplayer is getting quite close to half life’s.</p>

            <p>exactly it is like in underhell chapter 1, ammo is low, it is more like survival, + have rpg like quest. I always wanted an rpg like black mesa game, or outlast like one. You could hide from hecu, perfect stealth game. Too bad this doesnot exist in current game.<br>
Plus i would add Infra like puzzles ,and details to the game.</p>
<p>In details i mean, in black mesa there never was something like you have to use props for progress, actual props are useless. Game is no more than beautiful version of half life. That is all. There never was something like pick up a keycard to open a door(actually you cant even close doors ingame,or most of the doors)  or read a code from a paper, something like in Gone Home. Only pros is you can pick up sentry gun.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
