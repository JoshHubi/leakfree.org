    <title>SOLVED: Can I set up a dedicated BM server via steampipe?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/solved-can-i-set-up-a-dedicated-bm-server-via-steampipe/14038</link>
    <description>Ive been running a dedicated HLDS (not Source but the original game) server for many years on a Windows home box, and the last incarnation used command lines via steampipe. I&#39;d like to set up a Black Mesa server in a similar fashion (it runs in a console window not the steam interface), is it possible? I&#39;ve looked around the past hour and cant find any info about it.  I did see an installer option for it when I installed the Early Access game on my gaming rig but I&#39;d like to run a server without buying the game again just to install the server on another machine - if it&#39;s even possible.

Any help is appreciated, thanks!</description>

            <p>SOLVED:</p>
<p>I had to use the login credentials of the account the game was purchased under.  Anonymous wont work unfortunately.</p>
<p>So my only concern is that steam allows me to play on my own server (meaning that 2 logins are active, one for the server and one client).</p>
<p>Thanks for the guidance!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I  use my login creds it says:</p>
<p>Logged in OK<br>
Waiting for license info…OK<br>
ERROR! Failed to install app ‘362890’ (No subscription)<br>
CWorkThreadPool::~CWorkThreadPool: work complete queue not empty, 1 items discar<br>
ded.</p>
<p>When I use anonymous instead it just says:</p>
<p>Connecting anonymously to Steam Public…Logged in OK<br>
Waiting for license info…OK<br>
ERROR! Failed to install app ‘362890’ (No subscription)</p>
<p>NO SUBSCRIPTION usually means it’s not a valid APP ID # but I checked around and 362890 seems to be the correct ID.</p>
<p>I tried it on another computer too, also made sure directories are writable, but same things.   Kinda strange.</p>

            <p>Add  “+login anonymous” in the command line parameters.<br>
If that still doesn’t work, launch SteamCMD, instead of the shortcut and use the following commands:<br>
login anonymous<br>
force_install_dir C:\YOUR\FOLDER<br>
app_update 362890 validate</p>

            <p>Thank you for the guidance, I vaguely remember doing something similar with my HLDS server some time back (which has been running great).  Unfortunately Black Mesa isnt installing app ID (it says subscription error when I attempt to install it.</p>
<p>The farthest I’ve gotten is doing the whole command line at once , but still no go.</p>
<p>When I type in:<br>
steamcmd +login <em>vanarchy</em> +force_install_dir d:\steamcmd\bm +app_update 362890 validate +quit</p>
<p>The result is:</p>
<p>D:\steamcmd&gt;steamcmd +login <em>vanarchy</em> +force_install_dir d:\steamcmd\bm +app_up<br>
date 362890 validate +quit<br>
Redirecting stderr to ‘D:\steamcmd\logs\stderr.txt’<br>

            <p>Try <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SteamCMD</a>, and use app ID “362890” (without quotation marks).<br>
Documentation should guide you further regarding the installing process of the server.<br>
When it’s done, create a shortcut of SRCDS and go to properties, and add the following command line parameters:<br>
-console -game bms +map dm_bounce -maxplayers 16</p>
<p>It should end up looking  like this:<br>
“D:\Servers\BMS\srcds.exe -console -game bms +map dm_bounce -maxplayers 16”</p>
