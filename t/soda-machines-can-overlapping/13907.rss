    <title>Soda machines can overlapping</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/soda-machines-can-overlapping/13907</link>
    <description>In 2012 release, hitting a soda machine with a crowbar would make it spit out a lot of cans that scatter all over the floor. Now they all overlap each other, so it looks like a single can on the floor but there&#39;s actually a lot of them.</description>

            <p>This might be the same issue as witnessed with other physics props, ragdolls clipping through each other and becoming inert to force, the cans clipping through each other, the broken boxes clipping and not being able to break the pieces down further, window/glass breaking in a simplistic manner, other physics props not breaking properly like mugs, props not floating properly in water and bodies sinking down way too fast becoming inert, some having problems with gibbing bodies, it might all be related.</p>

<p>You might consider consolidating all of these into one post. Easier on the mods and devs.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed this too, but I doubt there’s a fluid way around it. If you have 15-20 little soda can entities with their own physics calculations, it’s going to cause quite a lot of slowdown on the machine.</p>

<p>Well, I’m following the bug tracker rule that 1 issue = 1 entry but this is a forum so maybe you’re right.</p>
