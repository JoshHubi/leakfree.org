    <title>Looking at getting a new GPU.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-at-getting-a-new-gpu/8668</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Right now I&#39;m running 2 5770&#39;s in a crossfire setup, but I&#39;m beginning to get tired of shitty ATI drivers and buggy crossfire performance so I&#39;m looking at getting a single Nvidia GPU. I&#39;m thinking if I can get rid of the 5770&#39;s for ~$120 CAD each I can up the budget for the new to card to around $300 or a little over. I&#39;ve been looking a bit and have been leaning towards a GTX 560 Ti or a GTX 570 for a little more. My local PC shop sells a Zotac 570 that has 1.25 Gb of VRAM as opposed to the standard 1GB most other cards have for around $330.

Basically, I&#39;m wondering if I would get better performance out of a 560 or 570, or if I&#39;m better off keeping my 2 5770&#39;s. I&#39;ve got a 750W PSU so power isn&#39;t an issue, and I&#39;m not reeeeally concerned about value, I just want to get rid of ATI and go Nvidia. I read that a 570 could run BF3 on Ultra settings, while currently I cannot.

I also don&#39;t know a lot about Nvidia surround, I&#39;m running 3 monitors in Eyefinity (which is also tricky with Crossfire) and am wondering if Nvidia cards are capable of the same thing, if anyone has any experience with that.


Thanks</description>

            <p>I have a 400 series and didn’t feel the need to get a new card, but I didn’t know the 600 series was right around the corner.  I wouldn’t mind upgrading to one behind the current series whenever I get an upgrade, assuming the next series didn’t start getting released right after.</p>

            <p>If the 680 had come out sooner, I’d have gotten one too.  I had loads of money when I upgraded my computer, much of it spent on stupid shit that I don’t need.  As it stands now, I may get a 600 series in about a year when I get my next tax return  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>The 680 looks awesome, but that price is a bit out of sudpuzzer’s range I think.  A 560 or 580 should do nicely.</p>
<p>I want a 680, but that price…</p>

<p>It’s funny, because I’ve been out of the video card market so long, I had forgot what was generally decent video card pricing. When I saw the 680 for $500, I gobbled that beastie up like it was a boxing day sale. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Oh well. Good to be in the 600 series, it’ll be nice having the best for a change.</p>

            <p>Yep, for multi-monitor compatibility the CCC is great, even with my 2 old style vga/dvi monitors+1 HDTV of a different resolution on HDMI it works perfectly and I get great framerates in Skyrim (~40fps outside, 60+ indoors) without even touching the clocks.</p>
<p>I must note that with eyefinity enabled I experience frame tearing with VSYNC on even when not running games. Monitor 1 gets perfect sync, while on the other 2 I have a sort of vsync tear line panning upwards over and over again.</p>

            <p>Yeah I got to this thread too late, was going to warn you that single nVidia card + 3 monitors do not mix.  Not sure what sort of “buggy AMD driver” experiences you’ve had, but I also generally don’t have a “fanboy” mentality - whatever gets good reviews and meets my criteria, I buy.</p>
<p>That said, I currently like AMD GPUs because they have great performance for low thermals and low power draw, and if I ever get 2 more monitors, 3 monitor Eyefinity.</p>
<p>As for nVidia manufacturers, I like EVGA (double lifetime warranty, even for overclocking) and Asus.  In any event, $.02 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Well, I’m loving this card so far. Haven’t touched the clocks and it already chews through BF3 no problem, and RAGE is smooth as butter. Beats the shit out of the 5770’s. Unfortunately, it only supports 2 displays. Not too sure what I’m going to do about that…</p>

            <p>Well, I don’t know why everybody’s so upset about AMD. I’ve got myself XFX Radeon HD6870 with dual heat pipe: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150521" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150521</a></p>
<p>It works great - it’s quite silent and very efficient at games:<br>
(SC2 all maxed out 1920x1080 - 90fps in 2v2 - never dropping below 60fps)<br>
(Crysis 2 all maxed out, DX11 on, hd texture pack on - it’s smooth although sometimes dropping fps in most unexpected places - like empty room, while in great outdoor running smooth - therefore I blame it on crytek.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
<p>Never had any driver problems, BSODs ets.<br>
And all that just for 650pln which is about 203$. Tell me how much would be nVidia’s equivalent…? ;]</p>

            <p>well, it really depends.<br>
I never had any driver problems with my hd5870, so I probably will buy the HD7970, because I don’t need that ugly SSAO but the Compute power, which is certainly unreached by the GTX680.<br>
(btw, SSAO is utter shit, I don’t get why most modern games have it, just looks like black mud)</p>

            <p>Nvidia’s drivers have so many great perks it’s hard not to prefer it to AMD. I have adaptive V-Sync turned on in ALL of my games (On when over 60fps, off when under), and I try to use FXAA in all games too. I also use Nvidia’s SSAO whenever I can. Here’s a screenshot or two I got of Bioshock’s SSAO mapping + one screenshot with FXAA and SSAO.</p>

<p>There really is no best and the benefits are only comparable with custom designs. IMHO the best manufacturers are ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, Zotac, Palit, Gainward, PowerColor messured by their releases of custom cards.</p>

            <p>I’ll probably end up going Nvidia when I upgrade my card as well. Apparently they have better drivers than AMD.</p>
