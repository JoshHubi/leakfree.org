    <description>Am I the only person that stuck around after the resonance cascade in HL1 to see [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s02XZCvJRXk&amp;feature=related&#39;]the security guard get revived with CPR?[/url] As soon as you walk out of the test chamber, the scientist performing CPR on the guard successfully revives him in Half-Life, but it never happens in Black Mesa.

I was kind of disappointed to see this omitted in BMS.</description>

            <p>yup, I watched to see if it would happen also.  I only noticed it when I was playing counter life the first or second time, and was blown away that they actually coded that into the original.</p>
<p>it was a little bit disappointing but then again you can’t really take the security guard anywhere without getting him gibbed by the hall of lasers or leaving him at the elevator. I don’t blame the developers for not putting it in their version because I didn’t even notice it for a long time.</p>

            <p>Not sure if any of you guys knew this but in the original, you could push the security guard under the computer terminal as it explodes, killing him and allowing you to take his gun.  This could have been a way to prevent that.</p>
<p>Or it could have been to make exiting the test chamber more dramatic.  The eerie and sad music starts to play as you see one of your co-workers working to save a life that’s probably already gone.</p>
<p>Either way, it makes no difference to me.</p>

            <p>This scene made me shed a tear (alongside the Black Mesa Inbound chapter). To see a person perform CPR on someone who isn’t going to wake up at any time and say that he’s going to be okay should be a huge traumatic moment in anyone’s life (although seeing someone’s lifeless body is traumatic enough for people with common sense).:’(</p>
<p>Can’t we all just appreciate that moments like this make us feel that way instead of berating such a scene like this, we’re all human, aren’t we?</p>

            <p>Honestly the secene was pretty powerful for me in Black Mesa in a way that it was not in Half Life. The guard is obviously too far gone, the scientist is obviously in shock. That plus the music (plus the fact that just a few minutes earlier this very guard had called me “hombre”) made the scene much more powerful. I prefer it tbh.</p>

            <p>From my understanding of current first aid teaching ( I got my certificate last year, so it’s fairly up to date), the scientist gets the “no breathing” RIGHT, the posture WRONG, the timing WRONG and the “not stopping” RIGHT. Overall, he gets it wrong enough for it not to work. Plus performing CPR through body armor probably isn’t going to work even if you’ve got everything else right. The fact the guard doesn’t get up is entirely accurate, given how badly the CPR is performed (to be fair, most people don’t get CPR right, or misunderstand it. That’s why first-aid courses spend a decent bit of time on it). Rule of Drama is very much in effect though. If the guard just got up and was fine, that would kill the mood a bit. I felt it fitted the feel pretty well.</p>
<p>Of course, this being a Half Life universe game…the scientist should really be using the Magic Medkit on the guard, rather than putting it next to him for Freeman to steal. Seriously… This is a setting where being hit in the face with a first aid kit instantly mends fractured bones. It can’t help to try it. Of course, NPCs don’t seem to use them in Black Mesa (except possibly HECU medics. I haven’t seen how they heal, if they have an animation for it), and we don’t know exactly how Freeman uses them at all (Osmosis? Or maybe he gnaws on them for sustenance?..I dunno…), so maybe that’s not an option until decades of combine rule train people in using medkits…</p>

            <p>I always saw it as the scientist being in a state of shock as to why he doesn’t notice Gordon.  Coupled with the dramatic music, I think it’s a powerful image but nothing more, and the player shouldn’t really be “rewarded” for hanging around at what is essentially a cinematic sequence (though of course in the usual fully-controllable HL style).  The game should encourage the player to move on, having a conversation happen before you see Eli and Kleiner again would be a bit awkward, pacing-wise.</p>

            <p>Well at that point, you’re required to follow the instructions given by the defib, remove clothing up to the chest, apply chest pads, stand clear, wait for the defib to analyze, give shock if necessary, then continue CPR.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Clearly he didn’t do any of that… except continue (incorrect) CPR.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Well the main purpose CPR isn’t really to revive people. It’s meant to keep them alive by manually circulating the blood (because their heart has either stopped or is going into highly irregular beats) until more trained medical personnel arrive to treat them professionally or take them to a hospital.</p>
<p>It’s not unheard of to perform CPR for hours on end without result. But if the victim does not get revived, you’re still required to continue CPR until either 1) you get tired, 2) more highly-trained personnel arrive, <span class="bbcode-b">3) someone brings a defibrillator/AED</span>, or 4) someone comes up to you and presents you with a legal “Do Not Resuscitate” order.</p>
<p>Obviously there wouldn’t be any way to get him to a hospital at that point, and there aren’t any medical professionals on-site. So it’s likely that he’d have to continue for several hours, get tired, or he’d just die from the Cascade.</p>

            <p>ok by the fact taht the guard can get up after you kill the scientist, i can deduce taht the guard was to get up at some point in time. I think this like the audio system was “cut” in order to bring down the file size.</p>

<p>I have another complaint: I feel like this scientist should talk to gordon, as soon as he sees him returning from the testchamber.<br>
At least they are the first persons who see each other after the catastrophe. But he doesn’t react at gordons presence at all which is not realistic. He could talk to gordon while doing cpr, asking him what the hell happened, or something like that or asking him to bring help…</p>

<p>But then people will start bawwing and raging that the devs are ‘changing too much’.</p>

            <p>I was disappointed that the security guard wasn’t revived, firstly because it was a great detail in the original… and secondly because in Black Mesa the scientist keeps going at it forever, saying the same “dammit, breathe” every 10 seconds. Black Mesa does a great job of avoiding the usual videogame thing where NPCs say the same line over and over, so it was really bizarre having him constantly say dammit, breathe.</p>
<p>Reviving the security guard isn’t needed, but the scene would have been less silly if the scientist scientist just said “dammit breathe” once or twice and then kept silent.</p>

            <p>Now that I think of this scene in a more detailed way…<br>
Probably, the guard was dead already or was crossing the death’s gates.</p>
<p>I expected him to be saved, but when it didn’t happen, I suddenly remembered that sometimes it is really not possible to save someone you wish to save - in some situations it’s beyond your abilities, no matter how hard you try or how good (or bad) you are at this.</p>
<p>This is what I felt. Maybe others took it differently, but it worked fine for me… Just added to the sad atmosphere of the incident…</p>

            <p>He shouldn’t be revived by CRP because it was ‘in the original Half-Life’, he should be revived because that scene made you go ‘Holy god, he just gave CPR to that guy and he saved his life.  THIS IS THE FUTURE OF GAMING! :O’.  It was one of the early parts of the game that demonstrated how interactive (Relative to the time) that Half-Life was.</p>

            <p>Well the main purpose CPR isn’t really to revive people. It’s meant to keep them alive by manually circulating the blood (because their heart has either stopped or is going into highly irregular beats) until more trained medical personnel arrive to treat them professionally or take them to a hospital.</p>
<p>It’s not unheard of to perform CPR for hours on end without result. But if the victim does not get revived, you’re still required to continue CPR until either 1) you get tired, 2) more highly-trained personnel arrive, 3) someone brings a defibrillator/AED, or 4) someone comes up to you and presents you with a legal “Do Not Resuscitate” order.</p>
<p>Obviously there wouldn’t be any way to get him to a hospital at that point, and there aren’t any medical professionals on-site. So it’s likely that he’d have to continue for several hours, get tired, or he’d just die from the Cascade.</p>

            <p>Yep. That coupled with the fact that he is performing CPR totally wrong in a number of ways reinforces that idea that he’s not really in the right state of mind.</p>

            <p>Good thinking.  It is like shell shock or just plain shock.  Hell, he could be performing CPR on a dead body but is continuing in panic mode because he may have lost grip with reality after seeing a person die or something.</p>

<p>… I don’t think anyone would be even remotely in their right mind in the seconds directly following an event like that. The scientist just saw a bunch of people die in front of him, and he’s now performing CPR on someone. He’s probably in a daze and not thinking clearly at all.</p>
<p>Think about the situation they’re in… Those first fer moments would be glazed over. I don’t think I would talk to anyone for quite a while if I survived something like that.</p>
