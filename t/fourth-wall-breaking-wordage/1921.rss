    <title>Fourth-wall breaking wordage</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fourth-wall-breaking-wordage/1921</link>
    <description>Rather than making a statement like &quot;Do this&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t do that&quot;, i&#39;ll just give an example of something i noticed.

in Half-Life2 : Episode Two, in the Antlion Caves, a rebel soldier makes the comment, &quot;Down there, there&#39;s [i]health[/i] and ammo, that sort of thing.&quot; Now let me ask you this: When was the last time you walked into a hospital and asked for [i]some health[/i]? Have you ever cut your finger at work and grabbed a bandage from a box labeled &quot;[i]HEALTH[/i]&quot;? When was the last time you referred to your lunch as a &quot;[i]pick-up[/i]&quot; or seen a storefront sign that read &quot;[i]items[/i]&quot;?

There are certain words and terminology that just don&#39;t fit right in real life. We may use them repeatedly in games and they all seem perfectly normal, but once spoken aloud outside the context of videogames, some words just sound stupid.

That statement in HL2:E2 bugged the crap out of my. it felt really fourth-wall breaking. i suppose what i&#39;m trying to suggest is that BM refrain from using these terms and words. i know all the dialogue has been recorded already and i&#39;m pretty certain all the textures have been finalized but i reeeeeeally hope Gordon uses [i]medical supplies[/i], arms himself with [i]weapons[/i] (as apposed to &quot;[i]guns[/i]&quot;) and climbs ladders without [i]pressing the USE key[/i]. Winks to the gamer are fine. Humorous and ironic references are strongly suggested. But when a character breaks that wall by accident, it bugs the beans out of me.

            <p>Fouth-wall breaking is funny in games if used right. Like in MGS4, during a conversation, the dude, otacon or whatever asks snake to insert the disk labled disk 2. Snake seems confused and Otocon corrects himself stating that that isn’t needed as they are playing on the PS3…Although it does get annoying when characters mention the use key or something similar…</p>

            <p>Black and White is an RTS. There are no walls to break because you are above the actual game world as opposed to being ultimately immersed in it.</p>
<p>One of the first lines in B&amp;W is “To move, click on the land and drag the mouse towards you to move forwards, or push away to move backwards.”</p>
<p>In Half-Life, the only mention of keys and mouse buttons are in the Hazard Course IIRC. So, not really an issue in BMS.</p>

            <p>given the average typing capabilities of people who don’t post in threads that relate to the topic they’re posting about, I think it only fair that I could think they meant to say “that is” instead of “is that”</p>

<p>English, motherfucker, do you speak it? Yeah, that post should have gone in “got a question” and was probably meant to, but its hard to imagine anyone reading it and not understanding that he was asking a question.</p>

            <p>Wow, I think i actually recognized it, but since I didn’t see a question mark, my brain just kinda jumped over the possibility that he might have been asking that as a question, so i assumed it was just bad grammer or massive typos.</p>

<p>Read again. He wasn’t saying it was proof, he was asking if it was.</p>
<p>EDIT: Though I agree, wrong thread.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>If you look at the very end of satchel fx whoever is playing goes to the menu at he end were one of the options is achivements. devs: is this proof of achivements in BM, a mistake, or something from the EP2 menu or something like that.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>first of all, what does that have to do with this thread? and second of all, that only proves that they didn’t bother getting rid of the menu button for the achievements. I’ve seen plenty of RELEASED mods that run on the Orange Box engine that have the menu button for achievements, even though they have no achievements whatsoever.</p>
<p>Not saying there wont be achievements, just that seeing the “achievements” option is no indication of their presence in the mod.</p>
