<p>PREPARE FOR THE BOUNCE ROASTING</p>
<p>There is a lot of of detail, which is almost detrimental to the map, because it becomes unclear as to how to get some places. I NEVER see any take the sewer route, which makes no sense because it leads to the only gluon gun on the map. Additionally, there are way to many cliff side pathways. There is one jump pad to left of the base on top of the dam that is never used. Partly because one of the pathways to use it doesn’t work because to properly because to use the jump pad, you have to hit the rocks above you to fling you properly. You shouldn’t need to hit a rock to make it work, it should just work on it’s own, regardless of how you approach it.</p>
<p>I know it seems like my thought are a bit unorganized, and maybe even slightly off topic, but there is a lot about these maps that is just completely unused.</p>
