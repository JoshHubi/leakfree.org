            <p>To clarify,</p>

<p>Office complex, a shaft-ladder that opens. Under some circumstances, player can kinda “clips” through it and get stuck in the ceiling. In this particular case, turning around and destroying the ceiling tiles helped get up.</p>
<p>I had the issue of clipping through ladders in Unforseen consequences (getting out of water at the encounter with the bullsquid), then this one and some more.</p>

            <p>When I try to take the ladder, I am not close enough to the ladder to fit through the small space and so I hit the ceiling. I cannot go down the ladder after noclipping up either, as the space is too small.</p>

            <p>We don’t have any new ladder physics, those are for MP only. Could you describe the issue in a bit more detail please, so we can get an idea of what’s going on?</p>
