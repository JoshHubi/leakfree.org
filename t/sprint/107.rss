    <description>Hi i am new but i wonder if there will be sprinting in BM? It would be cool but when sprinting you cant fire your gun like in Real Life because it could be too inaccurate. Like when you are sprinting your gun&#39;s barrel will face upwards and your gun&#39;s stock will face downwards.It would be cool. :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>I know, and I did look at that first, but I noticed it said the sprint speed was 327.5 despite just being 320 in the console. The mph conversion also seemed off to me, so I figured I’d do it myself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Half-Life 2, the players hull height is 72 units tall(&amp; so is barney) because all of the human characters use a scale of 1 foot as being 12 units, or 1 unit equals 1 inch. (As opposed to the maps &amp; props which use a scale of 1 foot = 16 units.)</p>
<p>From what I can find on the valve wiki, speed is given in map-units(i.e. inches) per second. To convert that to miles per hour, just multiply by about 0.056818. The player movement speeds according to the dev console (&amp; cl_showpos for crawling speed) are:</p>
<p>HL2_normalspeed 190		(10.795455 mph)<br>
HL2_sprintspeed	320		(18.181818 mph)<br>
HL2_walkspeed	150		(8.522727 mph)<br>
crawl-speed	63.33		(3.76875 mph)</p>
<p>There. That’s how I figured it out. I don’t need some “in-game-speedometer” to figure out what’s going on. In fact, it took me longer to explain than it did to figure out. Start up a treadmill, see if you can walk 8.5 miles an hour for more than a minute (without a HEV suit)</p>

            <p>The ability to aim and shoot while sprinting is a good gameplay decision, regardless of the realism.  The half life series is not a tactical shooter.  In addition, I am glad the sprint feature in BM is not tied to the suits auxiliary power.</p>

<p>Actually I DO NOT want those changes implemented in HL, I was merely emphasizing the reasons that could cause the sprinting to seem awkward in case anyone cared.  I agree 100% that the current implementation is the best.  I do not care that the sprinting can seem awkward.</p>

<p>If you notice, you said HL2 normal speed is just about 11 mph, which you also claim is the avg human sprint speed.  If that is supposed to be sprinting, how come it seems so slow in-game?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually I never mentioned a average sprint speed, but I think that the reason it seems so slow is because of the scale of the environments. Because movement &amp; collision is so bulky, (the player needs a minimum of 33 inches to walk through) everything is 4/3’s the size they should be. Doorways seem taller &amp; halls seem longer. This is probably why it seems so slow.</p>

<p>Im not arguing with him, my whole point is that the speed itself is not what makes sprinting seem awkward, gordon’s weapons do not move realistically and that is why the running looks weird.  Not the mention the fact that his head doesn’t really move while running, its like gordon is floating.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Basically what you’re saying is: I saw this stuff in other games, and now I want it in half-life. I will say this: when you run with a weapon down like that, there is one of three possibilities.</p>
<ol>
<li>The view model will pop up instantly when you do shoot (Ugly)</li>
<li>There is a delay between the gun getting pulled up, and the shot being fired (Annoying)</li>
<li>You will not be able to shoot at all. (Even more annoying)</li>
</ol>
<p>Or the weapon is always up, but wobbles around a bit. I think this is the best solution. It really isn’t worth discussing.</p>

            <p>Im not arguing with him, my whole point is that the speed itself is not what makes sprinting seem awkward, gordon’s weapons do not move realistically and that is why the running looks weird.  Not the mention the fact that his head doesn’t really move while running, its like gordon is floating.</p>
<p>The sprinting is not fast enough for the speed alone to cause the awkwardness, Dias’ figure of 18 mph is still within an acceptable human sprint range.  Its not like hes running at 50 mph, now that would seem awkward in and of itself.</p>
<p>Think about this, Gordon’s apparent normal speed is 11 mph (avg. human sprint speed as stated by Dias), why doesn’t it look like hes running than?  Because this is a video game and not real life, this discussion is getting too technical. lol</p>

<p>Thanks!  I was wondering where you got those numbers, I will trust that they are correct. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>If you notice, you said HL2 normal speed is just about 11 mph, which you also claim is the avg human sprint speed.  If that is supposed to be sprinting, how come it seems so slow in-game?  Accordingly, I always wish there was a non-suit sprint in the beginning of HL2.  I guess Gordon cant run unless he’s wearing an HEV suit. :facepalm:</p>
<p>Anyway, Ive noticed that average mph varies depending on distance and to be anywhere from 10-20.  I do agree that the sprint may seem a little too fast but the only reason is LOOKS awkward is the gun position, not the speed.</p>

<p>In Half-Life 2, the players hull height is 72 units tall(&amp; so is barney) because all of the human characters use a scale of 1 foot as being 12 units, or 1 unit equals 1 inch. (As opposed to the maps &amp; props which use a scale of 1 foot = 16 units.)</p>
<p>From what I can find on the valve wiki, speed is given in map-units(i.e. inches) per second. To convert that to miles per hour, just multiply by about 0.056818. The player movement speeds according to the dev console (&amp; cl_showpos for crawling speed) are:</p>
<p>HL2_normalspeed 190		(10.795455 mph)<br>
HL2_sprintspeed	320		(18.181818 mph)<br>
HL2_walkspeed	150		(8.522727 mph)<br>
crawl-speed	63.33		(3.76875 mph)</p>
<p>There. That’s how I figured it out. I don’t need some “in-game-speedometer” to figure out what’s going on. In fact, it took me longer to explain than it did to figure out. Start up a treadmill, see if you can walk 8.5 miles an hour for more than a minute (without a HEV suit)</p>

<p>Hi i am new but i wonder if there will be sprinting in BM? It would be cool but when sprinting you cant fire your gun like in Real Life because it could be too inaccurate. Like when you are sprinting your gun’s barrel will face upwards and your gun’s stock will face downwards.It would be cool. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I think the real reason sprinting is awkward is because you sprint at nearly 18 miles per hour, and regular running speed is about 11 mph. It’s even worse in HL1, because you’re always sprinting.</p>
