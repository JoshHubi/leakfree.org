    <description>Hi, my game has been crashing constantly for a while.  At first it would only happen sometimes while loading, which i could ignore, but since i launched the rocket, it&#39;s been happening basically every five minutes.  It&#39;s becoming a huge problem and it&#39;s making the game almost impossible to play.  there&#39;s no real pattern either, i&#39;ll just be playing like normal when suddenly the game stops working and i have to use task manager to force quit it.  Please help!</description>
