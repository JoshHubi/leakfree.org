    <title>What can the community do?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-can-the-community-do/3831</link>
    <description>As the community projects are now getting on a bit, is there something the community can help with at the stage you guys are at? Things like:

-Specific discussion topics
-Particular gameplay aspects
-etc

This question is by no means a way to get updates indirectly, but to see how the fans can keep contributing (on top of the wiki). Since there has been a lot of trolling and angst on the forums lately, it could be a good way to get some more interesting conversations going. Input from the devs could be very constructive here «wink wink»

Edit: [i]I have asked this question in a couple of places but got no answer (either positive feedback or have been flamed). I don&#39;t post much but i try to make them count.

            <p>^   AGREE!  That is… we would rather silence than whining and crying and demanding a daily feed of info.</p>
<p>What was it a dev said recently?  So much media has been released that if you stitched together all the screenshots, you would already recognize most of the game.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is true, but considering how much is really out there, it DOES seem there is A LOT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN.</p>

            <p>I’ve been following the mod for 5 years, and moderating the forums for a significant portion of that. You’re not the first person to ask, and the devs have said no very firmly, for the sensible reasons I already pointed out to you. Believe what you want but it’s never gonna happen.</p>

            <p>But we have already clarified that the devs won’t give you their models, so this model pack for Garry’s Mod is the only alternativ I guess. There is also a very good trailer with these HECU grunts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xbXIalrn8" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xbXIalrn8</a></p>

            <p>Or, you can just wait until release, and make your trailer after. The materials will be available and there will be people who haven’t seen it still.</p>

            <p>You can download a model pack for Garry’s Mod with some HECU grunts in it, these aren’t the real Black Mesa models, but they look good, too.

            <p>Ok, maybe a quick preview of the script would change your mind.</p>
<p>Picture a hallway leading to a bit bigger place (no ceiling, you can see the sky but it’s at night so everything is pretty much lit by the moon, some containers in the bg). The camera is moving at the end of the hallway. A few marines run into the scene (the camera follows one of them, the other ones take cover behind the containers etc). “Main” marine runs against the wall and checks the area around the corner. Then, a Gargantua appears at 7 o’clock (behind the camera), marines start shooting at it, maybe one of them gets hit by it and flies a few meters across the room and “reaches a wall” (;P) &lt;the camera moves documentary-like, fast movements, motion blur etc&gt;. Finally a shot of energy hits the Gargantua. It stands still for a second or two and smashes to the ground. Marines turn around, camera moves between them and closes up on a dark hallway that the shot came from. All you can see is a smoking tip of the Tau Cannon. As the camera closes in you see an edge (specular [shiny stuff]) of Gordons glasses in the dark.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>It’s a bit hard to explain what I mean but I think it would look really cool…</p>

<p>Not bad, looks awesome. But something about the “Free Download” label makes it sound like retarded scamware… which Black Mesa clearly is not. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>I know! lets put out tons of ad parodies, like “Crowbar the headcrab to win!” or “step on the cockroach!” or “Your prize is inside this crate, use the crowbar to break it open!” or we can parody the quiz ones too "Which one of these enemies is a Headcrab/Zombie/Vortigon/HECU/etc and then show 3 pictures and no matter which picture you click on, it still takes you to the download site and says “you win!”</p>

<p>They wont give you their models prior to release.</p>

<p>I’m not asking for their ingame models, I’m asking for their high res base models, which were used to extract normal maps from etc…</p>

<p>Fix your links dude I can’t click it!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Those are very nice by the way, I still wish the release will come unexpected 'cause a greyed out button is unnecesserely teasing.</p>

            <p>Great ideas Andy0101, maybe there is a way to combine the promotional artwork with the wiki?</p>
<p>Dunno, just an idea.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Thank you. Yeah, I thought that too but I wanted to state that it’s free and I couldn’t think of a better way. Maybe the button should just say DOWNLOAD, or just say FREE? Or remove the button completely?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d say make it “Download Now!” or “Download HERE” or something like that. I don’t think the button is a bad idea though.</p>
