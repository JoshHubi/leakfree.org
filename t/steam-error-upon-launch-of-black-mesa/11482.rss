    <title>Steam error upon launch of Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-error-upon-launch-of-black-mesa/11482</link>
    <description>Couldn&#39;t find this is another thread, so thought I&#39;d try a new one.

Every time I try to launch Black Mesa, I get a Steam error message pop up stating &#39;This game is currently unavailable. Please try again later.&#39; I have tried every fix I can find: Installed in D:\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS, restarted Steam, completely uninstalled all SDK files and redownloaded Source SDK, 2006, 2007, run HL2 to make sure all files are correct, restarted Steam (it appears in games list), tried verifying all game files and all come up fine. 

I cannot physically think of what else to try to get this to work. I even installed it from the setup file, not the zip. Copied the zip and setup from a friend who used them and it all worked fine for him. Any ideas on how I can fix this?

Running Win7x64, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 950@3.06GHz, 6GB DDR3, AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series</description>
