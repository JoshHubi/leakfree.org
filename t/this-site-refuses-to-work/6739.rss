    <description>I haven&#39;t had any problem with this until today. All of a sudden this sight doesn&#39;t work on my laptop and I have no idea why. I&#39;m on my lpt right now but using a proxy and it&#39;s working. I&#39;ve tried changing my DNS servers but still nothing. Anyone know what&#39;s up?

Edit: WTH it just fixed itself. Well if anyone has any idea as to what happened I&#39;d still like to know.</description>
