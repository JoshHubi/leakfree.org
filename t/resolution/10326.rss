    <title>Resolution?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/resolution/10326</link>
    <description>First of all, sorry if this has been asked a million times, I can&#39;t seem to find the search function in the forums.

When I try the play the game, the highest resolution type i can choose is 1024x768, but my resolution is 1366x768, and the menus are really out of proportion. In game seems fine to me but I can&#39;t be sure, the crosshair seems little shrunk.

Anyway, under aspect ratio there are three options. Normal 4:3, Widescreen 16:9, Widescreen 16:10. But whatever I choose, after returning to video menu, I see that it automatically has returned to Normal 4:3

Anyone else having these problems?

Thank you, and thanks for the mod, it seems like it was worth the wait  :slight_smile:</description>

<p>This did the trick, thank you very much!</p>
<p>As for the other question, no i didn’t have this problem with HL2. HL2 automatically recognizes my resolution as “1366x768 (native)” without me altering with aspect ratio or any other thing.</p>

            <p>You don’t have an issue assigning your resolution from the GUI within HL2?  It’s the same configuration.</p>

</aside>
<p>1366x768 is ~16:9 (16 pixels wide for every 9 pixels tall).  The aspect ratio option is only really there to “filter” the correct resolution options.</p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio of 16:9 FIRST, then you should see 1366x768 in your resolution drop-down.  Save the setting after you’ve changed both.</p>

            <p>Same problem, however for me , I don’t have an option of more than 1024x768. That’s the highest resolution option. My native is 1600x900. I thought I’d change the aspect ratio as well but nothing happens. After choosing 16:10 and then clicking apply , no effect. The game screen is squeezed. I don’t want to play Black Mesa with make do resolution as I know it can be fixed. Just don’t know how.</p>
