    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/speakers-for-half-life-lan-party/62547</link>
    <description>we are going to set up a lan party for a half life marathon and we will be playing all of the parts without any breaks, Im thinking to get bookshelf speakers because I want flat natural sound not boomy and inaccurate sound. Are https://appuals.com/best-bookshelf-speakers/ these any good? What do you guys are rocking at the moment?</description>

            <p>I always get a kick how amp/ speaker manufacturers highlight their ‘power handling’ and ‘wattage’<br>
The only valid measurement is ‘RMS Power’. Check that first if you’re concerned about how powerful your system actually is. A professional rock guitar amp that has two 4/12 cabinets like what Hendrix used had 100w of RMS power. The other marketing terms are basically unimportant for consumers but, they look neat for advertising</p>
