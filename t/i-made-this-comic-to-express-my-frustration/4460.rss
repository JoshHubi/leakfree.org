<p>Even though the devs are doing this for free it’s still kind of annoying that they missed a release date. I mean, if you aren’t 100% sure you’re going to release it in 2009 then don’t say so. Lots of people became disappointed and it was better they’d just say nothing. Also please stop saying in every newspost that it’s ‘just around the corner’ and ‘it’s coming’ because that also raises false for a fast release.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Look, the date was most likely set so that it would still fit with the 200X year of Half Life, but now that it’s 2010, they lost their time frame, so they have more breathing room than they thought and can take the time they need to get this completely free side project done</p>

<p>No its not, there is no mod remember its the gaming worlds biggest hoax.</p>

<p>Nah, that would have to go to the rumors of Team Fortress 2. How long was that in “Development” for? Something near 6 or 8 years? And that was by paid employees of a software company.</p>
<p>Well, this is a pretty big let-down though. I used to come here if not every day, every other day (that’s when they were calling an 09 release date.) Since we are now into July, I come here once a month, just to see if there is any news.</p>
<p>I even used to be a member of the Black Mesa Official STEAM group until I realized that the last news posted there was nothing more than a dumb joke and even it’s somewhere around 2 years old.</p>
<p>So, in short, I hope it comes out, at least soon, but I’m not expecting it in 2010, nor am I expecting it in 2011. I know this whole deal is a HUGE undertaking, but 6 years in development is pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>Good Luck all, and good luck to the mod,</p>
<p>Defender</p>
