    <title>Egypt attacks Algerian soccer players?!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/egypt-attacks-algerian-soccer-players/1844</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if there are any of soccer fanatics here, but this REALLY pissed me off. Considering I&#39;m half Algerian (and half Russian) I root for both teams. But this is just a cowardly act from Egypt. First, busting the heads of the players open with rocks. Then, a murder of an Algerian soccer fan in Egypt. This has GOT TO STOP.

EDIT:A friend told me it wasn&#39;t the murder of one Algerian, but rather 8. New link also, videos on bottom.

2ND EDIT: YEAH! ALGERIA WON EGYPT 1-0 LOL.</description>

<p>Be honest, how often do changes made without violence happen?</p>
<p>Plus, bloodlust, greed and the power over life and death is what every other country in the world is looking for. To be the <span class="bbcode-b">DOMINANT</span> one. Peace was always a factor looked upon, but in conclusion there would always be a country that says “We are superior!” and lead by a man with one testicle and the world’s most famous mustache.</p>
<p>EDIT: Guys, this dispute is over. We won, so just let this thread die in peace.</p>

            <p>FYI: Changes can be made without violence, regardless of what Hollywood tries to tell you.</p>
<p>Germany re-united without violence, for example. East Germany was not retaken by force. India was freed from British occupation through non-violent, civil disobedience. Even the revolution in Iran went non-violent (at least the rebels didn’t shoot - the military, of course, did it’s best to exterminate the rebellion).</p>
<p>“Socially unacceptable” is not what I would apply to civil disobedience. You misunderstood me there. I rather think it’s a citizen’s duty to disobey a corrupt and oppressive government as best as he/she can. I don’t think that demonstration marches or public protest is socially unacceptable. I agree with your opinion that anybody who thinks so is downright insane.</p>
<p>Of course, if you had stopped to think about it for a minute instead of immediately being convinced that I would suggest something as insane as that, you might have come to the conclusion that maybe I had expressed myself a little misunderstandable, and that your first impression of my post could have been wrong.</p>
<p>But that’s far too off-topic. Let’s get back to soccer worshippers killing each other.</p>

            <p>Should Gandhi have just shut up and put up incase he hurt the british feelings. Was rosa parks just self concious about the size of her dick. the idea that nobody should behave in a “socially unnaceptable” way for the sake of freedom or rights is really insane and offensive</p>

            <p>People will take any excuse to behave violently or at least socially unacceptable.</p>
<p>“For our country!”</p>
<p>“For freedom!”</p>
<p>“For women’s/human/animals/plants etc. rights!”</p>
<p>“For the (political) party!”</p>
<p>“For the Pope!”</p>
<p>“For God/Allah/the Boogeyman/Santa Clause/ any other imagined authority figure.”</p>
<p>“For our president/the Fuehrer/our prophet/our leader/ any other actual authority figure who makes us feel superior to all other humans on the planet”</p>
<p>“For our sport club!”</p>
<p>It’s all just excuses. The truth is, what they really ought to be saying: “For the sake of bloodlust, greed and the power over life and death! And for compensation of our fear that other guys might have bigger penises!”</p>

            <p>God fucking damn it.<br>
This is why I didn’t have any intrest in sports until one day I woke up and realized “oh dear me, I’m fat”, then started playing foorball. People take the game way too fucking seriously.<br>
But NEVER would I have thought it would come to this.</p>
<p>I feel like it’s part of human nature to blindly worship things. Not just religion, but also sports teams, consoles, franchises, Sci-fi franchises <span class="bbcode-i">(ie Star Trek vs Star Wars aka fucking waste of time)</span>, and political parties.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there are any of soccer fanatics here, but this REALLY pissed me off. Considering I’m half Algerian (and half Russian) I root for both teams. But this is just a cowardly act from Egypt. First, busting the heads of the players open with rocks. Then, a murder of an Algerian soccer fan in Egypt. This has GOT TO STOP.</p>
