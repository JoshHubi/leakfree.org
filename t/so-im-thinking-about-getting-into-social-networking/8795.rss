    <title>So, I&#39;m thinking about getting into social networking</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/so-im-thinking-about-getting-into-social-networking/8795</link>
    <description>I have steadfastly refused to join places like Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter in the past, but I&#39;m thinking it might help my choice of career with things like networking.

So, I&#39;d like to pick your brains and get some advice about this.  Would it help with networking?  Would it potentially hurt me?  I don&#39;t know much about the subject so I&#39;m a bit clueless and would appreciate some assistance.

[i]Please, only serious posts.  I enjoy joke posts as much as the next person, but please, let&#39;s keep it to a minimum, folks.  Thanks![/SIZE][/i]</description>

            <p>I would say that getting work through FB networking is about as likely as contracting AIDS from having a pet goldfish.</p>
<p>As Assassin47 mentioned, LinkedIn is good.  There is also <a href="https://www.xing.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.xing.com/</a>, but this is probably better for you if you live in Europe.  I don’t know how many US employers operate on there.</p>

            <p>Thanks The_Assassin47 for your suggestion of LinkedIn and everyone else.  If there are other networking sites to suggest beyond the ones I mentioned, please don’t hesitate to mention them.</p>
<p>Again, thanks!</p>

<p>Since people have weighed in on Facebook (and I really hope you’re not considering MySpace), I’ll give my opinion on Twitter. I don’t get much out of it because I am a nobody who never has interesting things to say and I don’t really care what celebrities are doing 24/7, but if you’re in a position where people do care about what you’re saying/doing, or you want to reach out to a customer base or fans or whatever, or you’re concerned about what Bill Gates is eating for lunch, then join.</p>

            <p>There’s no reason at all for people to get worked up. Their anger is derived from frustration with the people they’re friends with and they have a tendency to use the website as a scapegoat for the stupidity they’re exposed to.</p>

            <p>facebook is just a website, it all depends who you are going to add to your friends list and what type of content are you going to “like”</p>
<p>if you just add your IRL friends and family all you will get out of facebook is a neverending feed of songs, old memes and random thoughts that they had/copy pasted from another site.</p>
