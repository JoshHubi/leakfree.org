    <description>So i was just thinking about all the bands and songs that i love that i would actually be interested in buying if it came to rockband but since most of the songs that are on the game are so generic and crappy i cannot do so.. list some of the bands you&#39;d like to see.

</aside>
<p>No, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they get them soon. Tool was featured in Guitar Hero 4, and Rock Band often adds songs that Guitar Hero had exclusively in the past. However it could be that they have some sort of agreement with Activision, in which case you’d have to get Guitar Hero to play Tool songs.</p>

<p>But on topic, It would be fun if there were more genres instead of the same old overplayed rock-classics. I would definately buy it if there more options, like black metal or indie pop, ect. Something for everyone, ya know?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>More genres? Already done. They have Kenney Chesney, Toby Keith and Lady Gaga on there now. :fffuuu: Putting that aside…</p>
<p>It is called Rock Band after all. The idea was for it to be a rock-lover’s game. But they have included lots of different stuff, especially in the DLC. Overall I’ve been very pleased with what they’ve come out with. The only bands I’m really still waiting for are 311 and U2.</p>
<p>And about collections - are you talking about track packs? I mean you can buy tracks individually, but if there’s an artist you really like you can buy a pack for a discounted price per song, sort of like buying an album. And sometimes they do make genre packs, right now the only one I can think of though was called like the Funk Pack or something (had James Brown, Average White Band, Earth, Wind and Fire).</p>
<p>EDIT: Here’s a list of all DLC for Rock Band. Perhaps not every band you might want is there, but just looking at the genre titles it looks like there’s a fair bit of diversity there.<br>

            <p>Quite frankly, I’m content with the songs the Rock Band games have out now. Sure, I’d love to see some “Xanadu” by Rush or something, but, I can’t complain.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know, I was simply pointing out the reason why people buy music games as opposed to becoming musicians - it gives you the illusion/impression/experience (whatever you want to call it) of being a musician without having to buy a lot of expensive equipment and spend years learning how to play.</p>
<p>That’s not to say some people still wouldn’t want to play for real and I understand that - I’m a guitar player myself. However, to say that learning how to play songs on a real instrument is a reasonable alternative to playing a music game is just silly (unless of course, you are already a musician, in which case, it is). Know what I’m saying?</p>

            <p>So i was just thinking about all the bands and songs that i love that i would actually be interested in buying if it came to rockband but since most of the songs that are on the game are so generic and crappy i cannot do so… list some of the bands you’d like to see.</p>
