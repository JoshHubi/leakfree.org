    <title>Suggestions to make the game more challenging</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/suggestions-to-make-the-game-more-challenging/5223</link>
    <description>I found hard mode to be still too easy. I blazed through the original on hard mode. Find some way to make it harder, like disable the quick save option cause that is like cheating. You could save every second if you wanted to, know what I mean?  :slight_smile: 

I waited 6 years for this game to be released and I don&#39;t wanna spend a quick time finishing it, I want to enjoy it thoroughly, thanks.  :smiley: 

Suggestions:

- Randomize the location of enemies and supplies for every loading. 
- Allow enemies to break/open doors so you can&#39;t hide so much.
- Disable quicksave
- Add insane difficulty
- Use SWAT 4 weapon mechanics where each reload is a whole new clip. (Ex. when you reload a gun with 20/30 ammo, the old clip remains for the next time, so you will have 20 bullets in one of your available clips, making the player choose wisely when to reload) 
- Allow the enemy AI to take notice of player sounds (running, firing, breaking crates). 

That&#39;s all I have right now, lol.  :stuck_out_tongue:</description>

<p>I also hate games where reloading causes you to lose ammo. Especially if the game doesn’t tell you beforehand.</p>

            <p>I assume it’s because having npcs active at the same time would cause errors, but since many locations are closed off from one another, triggers are used to spawn npcs in areas the player can get to &amp; remove npcs the player can’t back-track to.</p>

<p>I’m confused: If you exceed maximum allowable entity data, how come the game actually can be played? Isn’t maximum a limit?</p>

            <p>I always play games on either the normal or hard difficulty. I used to conserve items and ammo like crazy, on the grounds of ‘you never know’, but I’ve learned that’s almost entirely self-imposed baloney.</p>
<p>Have you considered the possibility that you just suck?</p>

            <p>Try playing a game on a mode harder than Easy sometime, you’ll see a lot of games include ammo conservation  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Alan Wake on Nightmare has the most intense ammo conservation ever. Running completely out of ammo on the first boss? Bad mojo.</p>
