    <description>Please forgive me, I was too lazy to take screenshots at the moment due to time of night.

These may have been said before, however I might as well post them in case I&#39;m mistaken...

1. On A Rail : Train lifts.

When on a moving train lift going upwards, if one attempts to use the train going forwards of backwards, the train falls through the elevator downwards and is then unusable and for a lack of a better word, &#39;spazzes&#39; out. This happens with all the elevators in On a rail.

2. Surface Tension :  Dam(n) Nodraw.

When entering the dam area, if you go into the upper water of the dam, and swim behind the concrete building, facing the dam you can see through the building.

3. Anom. Mat. : Door Bugs

If one stands in between a set of double doors closing in Sector C, the doors get stuck closing and consequently trap the player.</description>
