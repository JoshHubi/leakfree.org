    <title>HL2 distant gunshots</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl2-distant-gunshots/13008</link>
    <description>I think black mesa needs the same effect HL2 has when you hear an npc firing from distance. In BMS you can&#39;t hear the npc&#39;s gunshot  when they are far away. HL2 had an effect which was done quite well. If an npc firing smg for example from a distance you could hear  their shots, which sounded quite different from up close. In BMS u cant hear the npc soldiers firing unless you are about 15m away.    

Does anyone know how to fix this?  

It would ad a lot to the game if this was implemented.</description>

They’re different guns, with different reports. Your method uses HL2’s Mp7 sounds, which do not match up with BM’s Mp5 sounds that you hear up close or with the player’s gun. Since the BM Mp5 uses custom sounds, it’s jarring to have distant NPCs make what’s recognizable as the HL2 Mp7’s report.</p>
<p>I’ve proven that, while the Black Mesa version has mixing issues, it does include the distant sound - without having to use any extra files or script entries. I even explained how the process works and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cufi9hbm8p51gee/single_npc.wav" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gave out a copy of the original sound that I re-mixed to help rectify the problem</a>, but apparently nobody was interested in actually paying attention to that.</p>
<p>And I really don’t appreciate the fact that you double posted simply to insult me and degrade the devs work, which was given to you for free.</p>

I used an example for the HL2 pistol as a proof of concept, then I posted a video demonstrating how the shotgun, which uses the same method, has different sounds with distance, and then I posted an improved version of the Mp5 shot.<br>
If nobody took a look at the files or used them ingame, that’s not my fault.</p>

<li>
<p>Your method has the NPCs using the HL2 sounds, and breaks consistency. Rookie mistake, hilariously.</p>

<p>The devs didn’t make a mistake, you just didn’t listen.

<p>Actually, dynamic displacement deformation doesn’t work in beta either (collision model is not updated properly) and it worked the same way in retail until env_terrainmorph was removed in Source 2007 branch.</p>

<p>See what he’s trying to get at is the distortion effect. Its not really present in BMS. It was the first thing I noticed about playing BMS. For some reason I can’t get my custom sounds in HL2 to have filtered distance gunshot either. Its odd.</p>

<p>No. It isn’t. I will agree that the Mp5 distant gunshot is much too quiet, but the shots are present for all weapons. I already confirmed it <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showpost.php?p=581809&amp;postcount=15" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">in this thread</a>, but apparently you need proof.<br>
So here’s proof - I went to bm_c2a5a, turned off the soundscapes (though one ambient noise stayed on, I guess it was an ambient_generic) and tested it out again - <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/jx7pu6qzk656sf1/nobodylistenstome.avi" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Watch and listen closely.</a></p>

<p>If hl2 can do it than so BMS should be able to. It is not a fantasy that while playing hl2, the npc’s at a distance create a different gunshot sound when they shoot from distance.

</aside>
<p>It’s very possible that the sound was accidentally disabled then, similar to some of the vox computer sounds that are supposed to play in the game but don’t play because of a scripting bug. If what I’m saying is true then hopefully they can fix it by the Xen release.</p>

<p>If hl2 can do it than so BMS should be able to. It is not a fantasy that while playing hl2, the npc’s at a distance create a different gunshot sound when they shoot from distance. It is a FACT that in BMS the player cannot here gunshots from an NPC after an amount of distance from yourself to the npc!</p>
<p>There is a different gunshot sound that is presented to the player in HL2 as an npc shoots from a distance. Different sound, there must be more than one WAV file for this to happen.</p>

            <p>I Don’t notice any change in the sounds. In BM  ,they just fade out the further away you stand.</p>
<p>In HL2,  the sound fades as u get further away but also merges with another sound, The distant shot sound. If you look in the HL2 weapon_sounds script and look for the npc version of the mp5 you will notice there are commands for soundfiles such as “mp5 Secial1”  also “Special2” If I could get GCFscape to work properly as it did once before I would search for these sound files within HL2 and extract them to listen.</p>
<p>I am pretty certain there is no change in NPC’s firing at a distance in BM.</p>

            <p>I was actually unsure about how BM had set this up, so to make sure I was giving you accurate info, I had a look-see in both the scripts and audio files, which indicated that the feature we’ve been discussing is actually in-game. I loaded up a map to test, and sure enough, the Glock, Shotgun, and Mp5 all do change when at a distance. They’re a bit quiet, though. Maybe boosting the volume in the right audio channel of the default sounds would help them be more audible in the chaos of standard combat.</p>

<p>I was actually playing with this a week or so ago - By modifying the HL2 sounds to include a different sound blended in one channel, I was able to study how the NPC fires work - The sound will actually have 2 sounds in it - one per channel. When you’re near the NPC, it uses the sound from the left channel only. When you’re far away, it uses the right channel only. Between those areas it blends the two channels together different amounts depending on your position.<br>
You can check it out with<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvwvn48o0ngf7k6/pistol_fire3.wav" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this modified HL2 pistol fire sound</a>. When you’re far enough away to allow the distant sound, you should hear a voice saying “No” when the gun fires - and if you open it in an audio editor, it’ll only be in the right channel of the sound.</p>
<p>Just format the NPC gunshot sounds to be stereo with the left channel having the original and the right channel having the distant, and you should be golden.</p>

<p>Mate, that’s awesome!   just one question. Do I place the distant sound with the other npc sounds? how does the game know there is a new file there to play?</p>

<p>That’s actually part of the .</p>
<p>As for distant gunshots, I’m pretty sure thats a setting in the weapon scripts, so you’ll just need a modified copy of the gun sound with proper effects/channel mixing (the distant gunshot sounds are handled a bit differently by the sound system compared to regular ones) and add that to the script.<br>
A cursory inspection of the BM and HL2 scripts should show what’s needed, but I’m not going to have an opportunity to have a look myself for a while.</p>

<p>Hi Jeff.</p>
<p>I had a good look and compared both scripts. It seems only a small change is necessary. in the weapon scripts of HL2 there is a line for the distant gunshot wav sound. I tried adding the same line to the weapon script file in bms. I added the line -    “wave”                  “^weapons/mp5/dist_1.wav”</p>
<p>So now it looks like this:</p>
<p>[b]“weapon_mp5.Single_NPC”<br>
{<br>
“channel”		“CHAN_WEAPON”<br>
“volume”		“VOL_NORM”<br>
“soundlevel”	“SNDLVL_NORM”</p>
<p>//      “wave”			“^weapons/mp5/single_npc.wav”<br>
“wave”                  “^weapons/mp5/dist_1.wav”[/b]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>I also made a new wav file named “dist_1.wav” placed in the mp5 weapon sound folder along with the other mp5 gunshot sounds. Sadly it doesn’t play in game though. There must be more I have to change in another script, I think. I will keep looking thanks for your help brothers.</p>

            <p>Dear Chumbuster. I think I know what you mean at least with absent distant gunshots in levels such as Surface Tension. I think my soundpack is just for you. It adds everything you mentioned plus more. I’m sure you had no idea it existed but here it is : <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=16424" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=16424</a></p>

            <p>What Jeff said. If you want the weapons to sound totally different over all, you need to edit the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Soundscripts" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">sound scripts</a> and get new sounds as some of the weapon sounds (even NPC ones) aren’t set up for it properly. That’s a tall order if you’re inexperienced. Even when you ARE experienced, it takes hours.</p>
<p>I haven’t gotten around to re-coding them as a result of how much time it takes. It took me a few hours in total to get my client set up how I wanted it before I had to do a wipe.</p>
