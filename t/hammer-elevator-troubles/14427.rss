    <title>Hammer Elevator Troubles</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-elevator-troubles/14427</link>
    <description>I figured I should make a new thread here for my current issues instead of going off-topic on my other thread in Help &amp; Suppoer constantly.
I&#39;m trying to make a simple elevator in Hammer based off of a tracktrain with path_tracks using the model of one of the lifts from Blast Pit. While I have the actual movement system working, I&#39;m having two main problems.
For some reason, whenever the elevator returns to the top after going down once, it &quot;bounces&quot; back down a short distance, quite sharply. I can&#39;t seem to figure out why this is happening, as it doesn&#39;t start like that, and it doesn&#39;t bounce when it stops at the bottom.

And two, I want a dynamic light to be inside the elevator and light up the elevator and the shaft as it moves, but for some reason the light is quite ugly and it won&#39;t light up brushes, only models.

I can&#39;t get any pictures right now because it&#39;s 2:30 AM where I live while I&#39;m writing this and don&#39;t have the energy to get up and start Hammer again, but can anyone offer some help? I&#39;ll provide more details if need be.

I&#39;m not the type that enjoys asking for help, especially several times in the same place, but I&#39;m utterly stumped.</description>

            <p>I just did a moving func_door elevator the other day, in fact. The lights light up the walls and objects. If you’re saying the light is ugly, I assume you’ve got the ‘light brightness’ option too high. 4 is the max, after that it ‘inverts’ weirdly. around 3 is a pretty good setting. If you’ve just got two stops, this is the way to do it:<br>

Have a look!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Meh, just use an invisible func_door for your elevator functionality, same results, far less buggy, much quicker setup.</p>
<p>As for the light, I don’t think Source supports dynamic lights in the manner you want to use them, so I think you’re SOL on that front. Remember the elevator in WGH? Same deal, you’ll notice the lights don’t light the walls even though they should. You could theoretically use an env_protected_texture, but that thing’s so buggy and only barely supported that you’re genuinely better off closing your eyes and pretending the shaft is lighting dynamically.</p>
