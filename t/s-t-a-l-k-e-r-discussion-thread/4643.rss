    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-discussion-thread/4643</link>
    <description>Thread for discussion of all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games because it&#39;s good enough for /v/ and has enough critical acclaim to warrant its own thread, as well as technical support since the Ukrainians can&#39;t make a game without a crippling amount of bugs.

Starting off, anybody else love it how Bug Trap creates more bugs and CTD&#39;s than it actually solves? It blocks X-Ray.exe or whatever it&#39;s called from running, preventing me from running the game.</description>

            <p>So far, I’ve only played Call of Pripyat, and holy shit, this game is so addicting, but ofcourse, I’d love anything with Pripyat in it.  I can’t really say much more, seeing as how I just made it to Pripyat yesterday.</p>

            <p>Has anyone noticed that all STALKER player characters seem to represent the actual players upon release?</p>
<p>The Marked One, he’s been around the block, having done some fighting in his time, but his amnesia leaves him disoriented in this “new” world of the Zone. We’d all played a few FPS games before STALKER, but nothing so different before.</p>
<p>Scar, the veteran merc who’s been in the Zone for a while but has found things have changed rapidly in certain areas. I bought CS with confidence, sound in my knowledge that my SoC campaign had me prepared. Of course, CS has very similar gameplay, but some of the areas underwent serious changes from the last game.</p>
<p>Major Degtyarev, he’s also a vet, but he’s been away from the Zone for a while and isn’t sure what awaits him on his return. After the catastrophe that was Clear Sky I didn’t play any STALKER for a while. I didn’t really know what awaited me at Pripyat, but after getting my bearings I was sure pleased with the result.</p>

<p>You take off after you kill a bunch of Monolith. And I mean a shitload. Like more shit than Jack Thompson and Pat Robertson combined. Or it could just be a set amount of time. However you are given the choice to stay behind and explore more before you talk to Garry or Pilot to let you out of the zone.</p>

<p>They’re different dude, I don’t think it’s fair to compare one to the other. One is a strictly linear, highly polished “rail shooter” (pun 100% intended), while the other is a non-linear, open world shooter with some role-playing elements. Yes, Metro is made by some ex-GSC devs, but besides a similar setting they’re pretty different games, but both awesome in their own way. Sure, Metro is pretty cinematic and epic, but it doesn’t allow the freedom of the Stalker games, which allows the player to create their own unique experiences and stories. While on the other hand,  Metro is strictly linear game which allows for more polished visuals and scripted sequences. It’s apples and oranges, comrade.</p>

<p>Agreed. I’m just saying that I like a linear story/game better than an open world mission based one.<br>
From what I understand S.T.A.L.K.E.R in the beginning was going to be quite linear, and for me that would of been a better experience.</p>

            <p>STALKER has a story.</p>
<p>But it is too complicated to shove down your throat in game.</p>
<p>So they let you work it out, much like Half-Life, has lots of story, but they don’t force feed you it every second.</p>
<p>Read the STALKER wiki, its a good, you might put a few things together.</p>
<p>In other news, CoP is great fun, I’m just really doing all the side missions rather then the main ones.</p>
<p>Today I did the unidentified mutants quest where you had to kill 2 burers, shat brix and was balls to the wall hard.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Personally I think S.T.A.L.K.E.R went in the wrong direction. Part of the early team broke off and made their own game called Metro 2033 which is set in a connected series of Moscow metro tunnels. Metro 2033 delivered me an experience that I expected S.T.A.L.K.E.R to present. Even if it lacked a little in combat it made up in exploration, immersion (I don’t use that term often), and bad ass cinematic moments.</p>
<p>It was truly amazing how Metro 2033 made subway tunnels into something epic. Seriously, worth the buy and in my opinion better than S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</p>

<p>Oblivion lost is a shitty pack of like 50 different mods that will clash, breaking the economy, adding game breaking weapons and out of place monsters everywhere making the zone into some sort of a zoo instead of a bleak wasteland. The mod breaks the games flow. There are much MUCH better mods out there, complete 2009, AMK, L.U.R.K.<br>
Not to mention over half of it was stolen from AMK or something.</p>

            <p>Call of Pripyat is easily the most polished and enjoyable out of the 3, it had hardly any problems on release. Looks like GSC got it right the 3rd time. Ever since I played SoC back in 2007, I fell in love with the series. It may have its quirks and bugs, but if you look past all that you get an incredibly immersive and atmospheric experience.<br>
One upcoming Stalker mod I am really excited for is this:<br>
<a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/mods/lost-alpha</a><br>
It’s a 3rd party mod that’s trying to capture the old “lost” Stalker that was shown back in its alpha stages, using hundreds of screenshots and videos of SoC while it was in development as a reference. They’re also using the 1935 build of the game which was publically released as a groundwork for many of the levels. So what we get is a whole new Stalker game, with expansive environments, cut enemies and a whole new storyline. I recommend having a good browse through the ModDB profile if you’re interested.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">Oblivion Lost</span> here. Once I picked up that little automatic shotgun that goes into the pistol slot, I knew I’d found my mod.</p>
<p>My rifle-of-choice is this baby I found and refused to tell the Dutyer who was asking for it:<br>
<span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span><br>
It has 45 bullets per magazine, 150% of the standard rifle of its type. Live long. The integrated grenade launcher makes life easy. Prosper. Attached scope-and-silencer make it the ultimate death factory, even if its rounds aren’t the most powerful. The ammunition is easy to come by. She’s my baby, and I’m glad OL introduced the ability for traders to repair gear.</p>
