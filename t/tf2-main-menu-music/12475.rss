    <title>TF2 main menu music</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/tf2-main-menu-music/12475</link>
    <description>So I finally decided to experiment by implementing soundtracks to the main menu of tf2, I guess many of you have done this, however every guide I&#39;ve seen says that in order to add a soundtrack you must go to Teamfortress2&gt;tf&gt;sound&gt;ui but I stop at sound because I only find sound.cache . Is there any other way to do this? Thanks</description>

            <p>Also I read that you need to change the name of the mp3 to “gamestartup(number)”, if thats necessary around which number should I start? Because if I accidentally replace any of the original soundtrack, my new soundtrack will be deleted. Should I just experiment untill it works?</p>

<p>You’ve got to make the ui/ folder, because the one the game is reading from is the one buried in the VPK. It should still read from the one you make in the folder system, though.</p>
<p>Unless the new updates have broken that, in which case try putting sound/ui/ into the custom/ folder.</p>

<p>Also, due to the steampipe update, you have to put that in your Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\my_custom_stuff\ for it to take effect</p>
