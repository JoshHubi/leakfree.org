    <title>Game Crashing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashing/14056</link>
    <description>Its crashing mostly when I hit the ESC key to pull up the menu.  Wish you guys would make the attachment uploader work the dump files &quot;.dmp&quot; that you request... You can&#39;t really fix things without knowing exactly whats going on.

Also its giving me an error at upload of the .dmp saying &quot;File extension is invalid.&quot;</description>
