    <title>Windows 7 Backup Images and secondary Hard Drives</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/windows-7-backup-images-and-secondary-hard-drives/2681</link>
    <description>Alright, So I bought the Student discounted Windows 7 Pro ($30) before really reading in too much on it.

Anyway, we all kinda were misinformed on what one gets when buying the Win741 student Windows 7.

Long story short, it takes a while for me to Install windows 7 compared to having a retail disk. Nothing illegal, just it takes installing and upgrading the same install.

So, in my genius, I made a image of my Windows 7 Install back in October after I just got it running with AV, Firefox, and settings all nice and correct.

I set windows to make back-up images every once in a while on my second internal Hard Drive.

Something went wrong when I initially formatted the drive when upgrading to W7 and now Windows 7 Action Center tells me I have disk errors and every time I boot Windows, before actually booting onto the disk, Windows wants to do a disk check on said secondary drive. The drive fails the disk check.

I can continue using the drive and windows goes it&#39;s merry way making sure my back-ups are on the drive.

So, my question is. Being that I want to re-format the drive, can I just cut and paste my Windows image back-ups to my main 1 terabyte drive for the moment while I format the back-up drive, then once formatting is all said and done, move the images back to the newly formatted drive and have Windows not freak out because something might have changed?</description>

<p>No, they are a system of folders and files that Windows Back-up and the Windows Install disk will recognize.</p>
<p>I think I can go into Windows Back-up and tell it to burn a back-up to a disk, but I don’t have any blank discs…and I have $400 in textbooks to buy tomorrow, so buying them is out of the question for the time being.</p>

</aside>
<p>So these are just a bunch of folders? If you can’t restore the backup image, just copy the folders/files manually to a separate HDD/partition.</p>

            <p>Open windows back up and look for an option somewhere to import backups from file, if it has a “browse” button, it should be fine.</p>

<p>Yes, formatting the C: drive to fix the N: Drive will work :brow:</p>
<p>You see, I’m trying to save my actual back-ups I already have BEFORE they are corrupt.</p>
<p>Sorry if I sound like a dick, but reinstalling Windows wouldn’t fix disc errors on a non-MBR drive. At least that’s a pretty drastic measure to fix something that can be fixed in Computer/Disk Management.</p>

<p>Formatting non-MBR drives is easy within Windows since Vista, (right click my computer &gt; manage &gt; Disk management.)</p>

</aside>
<p>Yea, the 1tb drive is the MBR, which is the C: Drive, being that I’m formatting the 500gb N: Drive. I should be safe.</p>
<p>Real problem is, making sure my back-ups still work afterwards.</p>

            <p>You could simply copy the file(s) because windows might not let you cut/paste (move) it due to it being protected by the filesystem or something.</p>
