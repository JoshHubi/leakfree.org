    <title>Physical/Limited Edition release?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/physical-limited-edition-release/62526</link>
    <description>Hello!

I am sorry if this has been discussed before but I was wondering if there are any words from the developers about the possibility of making a limited edition (physical disc) available for fans once the game is complete?

I already have bought the digital copy but I think it would be nice to have a collectible item and perhaps this would also be a token of appreciation for the team?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>I love this idea. I would put it right next to my Half Life CD disk from 1999.</p>
