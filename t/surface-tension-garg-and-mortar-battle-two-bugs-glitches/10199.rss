    <description>I am sorry for not providing a getpos, but I think you know what I mean when I talk about the Gargantua Battle in Surface Tension when you have to kill it with the Mortar after you fled from him from the tunnels.

[b]1. Gargantua attacking the silo before you are even on it.[/b]
This has been confirmed by others who did the same thing. When I ran out of the tunnel away from the Garg I first jumped into the water to be safe from it. And the Gargantua already was attacking and shaking the silo although I was still in water.
(@devs: If you don&#39;t want to fix the coding, make it so that you have a huge picture of a sexy Garg female on the silo, then his behaviour is understandable.  :wink:  )

[b]2. Mortar screen totally messed up.[/b]
I didn&#39;t take a screenshot the first time I played through (I will provide one later). Until then I will describe how it is messed up:
First I always saw the small black and white crosshair on the screen twice. It was flickering between two positions. One position was in the center of the screen and the other was where I was aiming. It seemed like the crosshair is always reset to the center, then rendered and then it is set to where I am aiming and rendered again.
The second thing is that the red laser dot and the two black lines (the point where the mortar will fire) are z-struggling. depending on the angle and distance I only saw parts of the red laser dot and also the lines are disappearing. With the constant screenshaiking caused by the Garg it constantly changed and flickered.
Everything combined (scree shaking, z-struggling laser and two flickering crosshairs) made this almost impossible to play.

Since point 2 is a rendering (and probably calculating x-hair position) glitch here are my system specs:

Win 7, 64 bit, Home Premium
Intel Core Duo i7 - 870  @ 2.93 GHz
8 GB of RAM
nVidia GTX 580
Driver: 296.10 (will update when I replay the game)

I play Black Mesa with the following settings:
Resolution 1920*1080
Aspect Ratio: 16:9
Model Detail: High
Texture Detail: Very High
Shader Detail: High
Water Detail: Reflect All
Shadow Detail: High
Color Correction: Enabled
Antialiasing Mode: 4xMSAA
Filtering Mode: Anisotropic 16X
Wait for Vertical Sync: Disabled
Motion Bluw: Disabled
Field of View 90
Mutlicore Rendering: (N/A)
High Dynamic Range: Full (if Available)
Use Bloom: NO
Hardware DirectX Level: DX9.0 (not changable)
Software DirectX Level: DX9.0</description>

            <p>Same thing with me. After watching a section of Youtube walkthrough, I got past it my aiming away, putting my finger on my monitor where the gun crosshairs were, then aiming back at the airstrike computer, and when my finger was on the garg, click the mouse. Then click Fire the same way</p>

            <p>Help!! I’m also stuck at the part where you are supposed to aim using the LCD to kill the grag - however just as described above when I press “E” nothing happens and a second crossahir appears every once in a while</p>
<p>and the grag also went for the silo even though I wasn’t there the first time round<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
EDIT: I was able to kill the Grag!! </span> First off- the crosshair on the screen is useless ignore it. Keep pressing “e” - every once in a while and black lines will momentarily appear for a split second. From what I gather if you first press and hold “e” that’s aiming on one axis, then press it again - that’s another one (either horizontally/vertically or the reverse, not sure), then aim at the “fire” button and press “e” (or LMB, hard to say actually) - after a lot of trial and error I killed it!! I was surprised I didn’t accidentally blow myself up first</p>
<p>EDIT2: I was wrong regarding the aiming - seems you must just aim where you want to fire with your crosshair on the map, and then aim at the fire button. Also I changes all of my graphics settings to LOW because “I think” it didn’t really work otherwise ( as in, stand near the console, and aim using your mouse and your regular crosshair, not the one on the LCD)</p>

            <p>Did you figure out a work around for this issue?  I’m stuck at the same spot.  I’ve tried changing graphics options, but nothing has worked so far.</p>

            <p>Im stuck at the same point, unable to fire the mortar and seeing two flickering crosshairs on the screen.  Similar specs, using two GTX 580s.  I updated to the latest nvidia drivers to no avail.</p>
