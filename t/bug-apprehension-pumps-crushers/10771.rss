    <title>[BUG] Apprehension - Pumps/Crushers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-apprehension-pumps-crushers/10771</link>
    <description>At the point where you are jumping across three of the large crushers, if you throw a barrel onto one it ends up freezing as the compactors never reach each other.

Its neither game breaking nor should have occurred (I threw it up there), just interesting.</description>
