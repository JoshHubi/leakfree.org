            <p>A TRUE sequel to Unreal 1, by Epic (fuck that Unreal 2 bullshit), with a large focus on recreating the same atmosphere the original had. I loved their approach of how the dead would tell the story, and the more you looked the more you understood what was going on. It always felt more like an adventure than most FPS games.</p>
<p>Also, they should get Alexander Brandon to do the music. His work was fucking fantastic and really set the game’s tone:<br>

            <p>Last night I was thinking that a Mass Effect co-op game would be really sweet.  It’s already squad-based; it seems like a logical step to drop two other human players into the squad with you.  Everything would need to be rebalanced, but still, it’d be awesome.</p>

            <p>Finally decided to utilize my account so here-</p>
<p>I organized mine from most wanted to least:</p>
<p>-All Valve games with the <span class="hashtag">#3</span> in them (Valve, why u no count to 3?)</p>
<p>-Star Wars Battlefront 3</p>
<p>-System Shock 3</p>
<p>-Fallout on the Creation Engine</p>
<p>-Another Deus Ex game (Don’t get me wrong, I loved HR, it just didn’t feel<br>
like a Deus Ex game to me…)</p>
<p>-A LoZ game in the style of the N64 games (I don’t really like the look of Skyward Sword)</p>
<p>-Homefront 2</p>
<p>-Crysis / Far Cry 3</p>
<p>-Rainbow Six Vegas 3</p>
<p>-GTA V</p>
<p>-Alan Wake 2 (Hopefully for PC this time, not likely though (Goddamn Platform Exclusives))</p>
<p>-A new 3D pokemon game that combines Gens 1-4 (Would never happen but still…)</p>

<p>That’s more or less correct  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> .</p>
<p>Starfox 64 3D is essentially Starfox 64, which is all well and good for Nintendo since they wanted to have some good games on the 3DS. However, the game didn’t really require a remake IMO. It’s still really fun and holds its own against modern flying games as far as how easy and fun it is to fly around and shoot stuff. The advances in technology since it was released won’t really benefit it except as far as graphics go, and Nintendo games aren’t really about graphics. What I want is a brand new Starfox game that plays like Starfox 64 - smooth controls, fun to play, and nothing but vehicle missions. None of this action platformer stuff that Adventures had. I understand Assault was kinda more like the original formula but I didn’t hear very good reviews about it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’d buy it.  Chrono Cross (maybe) only had one of the playable characters from Chrono Trigger.  Guile (or whatever his name was, masked wizard) was originally supposed to be Magus, but they had to scrap that side story because they had, like, 40 characters, and no, they aren’t allowed to expand on one of the most awesome characters in the original game.  They had to expand on other characters instead. :meh:</p>
<p>Plus, Schala’s hair is supposed to be blue, not blonde.</p>

<p>You mean like Penumbra?  You could also try out the Chzo mythos games by Yahtzee; they old school point-and-click adventures, and they’re pretty suspenseful at times.</p>

            <p>It’s already been mentioned, but Jedi Knight 4, as long as it’s more like 1+2 and less like 3. Being Kyle Katarn was most of the fun of that game.</p>
<p>Also:<br>
Jet Force Gemini 2 or remake of original<br>
Mass Effect MMO<br>
Chrono Trigger 2 (Chrono Cross was just in the same universe right?)<br>
Tales of Symphonia 3 - that is, if it’s like 1 and not like 2<br>
A Starfox game that recaptures the spirit the original game and Starfox 64 had<br>
An Age of Empires 2 remake, or a sequel with that time period and style of gameplay</p>
