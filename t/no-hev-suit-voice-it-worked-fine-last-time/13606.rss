    <title>No HEV Suit Voice ? It Worked Fine Last Time...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/no-hev-suit-voice-it-worked-fine-last-time/13606</link>
    <description>well, i&#39;ve installed a bunch of mods, as i usually do, though last time when i had BM installed the suit voice worked fine... i just reinstalled it a few days ago (i screwed around with mods a bit too much and things just got worse and worse, though now everything works as i want it)except that, i even tried throwing grenades at myself, with subtitles on, the stuff that the suit would normally say shows up just fine, but no voice... i&#39;ve validated the &quot;Source SDK Base 2007&quot; twice... nothin&#39;... and they used to work fine... what am i missing here ?

If anyone has the wav files and knows where they should be stored (or where i should look for them) please post a link...

Thanks  :smiley:</description>
