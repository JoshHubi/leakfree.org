    <title>Congratulations on releasing Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/congratulations-on-releasing-black-mesa/13786</link>
    <description>Dear Black Mesa Dev team

I have been following your work since the beginning. When I first saw the trailer back in 2008 I was amazed at the work you&#39;ve done and couldn&#39;t wait for 2009 but after hearing it needed more work i was sad to hear about it. so I all waited till you released part of the game and I was amazed at all the small details you&#39;ve added to it. This was a true homage to the original half-life game. I cant wait to see what else you guys do in the future. So congratulation on soon releasing Black Mesa on Steam.

Thank you guys for your dedicated work on your game</description>

            <p>I also would like to congratulate you guys!</p>
<p>Ever since i saw this on youtube…<br>

<p>… my wish has been granted and so I’ve been watching your hard work on the mod almost every day, or at least twice a week. Then this trailer came out…</p>

<p>…and my jaw just dropped… and then after 3 more years of patient waiting, I’ve repeated my childhood days in Source engine … the same thing I’ve said to Brian in his thread goes to all of you … You’ve done an incredibly good job  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  (and still doing)</p>

            <p>To say we lied is to say all along we knew  one thing, and yet stated another. The fact of the matter is that yes at one point we did say never ever pay, however along the way it changed. We DID let the fanbase know but the fact that we didnt broadcast it every month to ensure every last fan got the message is where there is a problem but I can’t see how that is our fault.  At this stage all we can do is offer patience while folks realize there was a change of plans.  In the meantime, the mod version is free so feel free consider it a gift for the inconvenience.  That is 7 years worth of work by at least 100 dev members to you without any charge.</p>

<p>Also, for the record, people change their mind all the time. Would you honestly expect someone to say one thing 5 years ago and say “welp, I said X 5 years ago, therefore I cannot possibly change my mind or opinion” ?</p>

</aside>
<p>That just illustrates how broken of a world we live in…  so sad.  By the way, if you change your mind about paying your 30 year mortgage 5 years down the road, there <span class="bbcode-u">will </span>be unpleasant consequences; but hey, if it’s O.K. to change one’s mind about “till death do us part” 5 years later, then truly the decision to change one’s mind and charge for completion of a mod-game is rather trivial in comparison, and doesn’t really justify the mean comments (which of course only show that people really do have emotional attachment to this).</p>

            <p>I’m going to start issuing warnings from here on. Being lazy and not reading what has been posted before (the answer is at the top of the page with a link) isn’t an excuse. We have had at least 30+ of the same questions. Please read through the questions here, the questions about the game thread and the MP thread maybe one 1 or 2 others or better yet do a search before posting questions (especially in the wrong thread). We want to spend our time working on the game not answering repeat questions.</p>

            <p>I do realize that there are the those who can’t afford to pay $20 for the retail Steam version. Even so, I hear that free legacy mod to also available to download, so the devil’s advocate argument doesn’t hold up very well. Even if the legacy mod isn’t the full game, it’s a very polished game to play, especially with the super-hefty price of $0.00.<br>
So, yeah, they’re always will be a ton of whining assholes around whining about money and piracy, but meh.</p>
<p>I just finished the Legacy Mod recently, and and I’m super stoked for the Retail Release!</p>

<p>I’m not “making fun” of you. You didn’t expect a price tag? Okay, sure, but accusing the devs of lying (when they’ve done <span class="bbcode-i">no such thing</span>) and encouraging piracy of the game they’ve spent over <span class="bbcode-i">ten years </span>of their lives working on is completely uncalled for.</p>
<p>Like I said, there’s a difference between not being <span class="bbcode-i">able </span>to afford it due to actual financial problems and <span class="bbcode-i">refusing </span>to pay for it because “it costs money” - Like it or not, your posts up until now sound completely like someone in the second category.</p>

<p>So what does the purchasable version have more than the mod? Is it only a way to fund the developers? Why not donations instead?Also thank for answering and uhhh so many fanboys attacking. You don’t do a great service to these people you know? Only show that the fans are [insert negative adjectives here]. :l</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Some of us wish to work on this game full time to get it up to the quality and standard it deserves. A donation model is not sustainable in the slightest, this has been proven time and time again. The reason any of this has taken so long is because everyone works on a volunteer basis, and has a real life and jobs and well…are human. Not only did going retail give us engine level access; something which isn’t possible without a license, it also allows us to commit more resources to further improving the game to the quality we all want.<br>
<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/27908-Black-Mesa-is-now-available-on-Steam-as-an-early-access-title/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This post</a> details just some of the things the retail has which the mod does not. It is substantial, and that list isn’t even close to exhaustive. People who are saying this is the same as the free release 2 years ago are flat out completely wrong.</p>

            <p>First post here…decided to register and let the Devs know I just bought the game on Steam.  Congratulations on the release.<br>
Looking forward to updates and Xen.  Half Life/HL2/Eps is/was the greatest FPS I have played so this remake is right up there as well.  Loved it in 2013 when the mod came out!<br>
Can’t wait to fire it up on Steam later today.  Cheers y’all!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Black Mesa is now a product, not a gift of good will. It was originally released for free because they <span class="bbcode-b">couldn’t</span> sell a mod based on an intellectual property without buying a license from Valve to do so first. The devs didn’t lie, originally it was meant to be just a mod so for free, but if they wanted to get it on Steam and improve the overall quality of it, it needed to become a commercial game. If it hadn’t become a commercial game, it would have stayed a free mod, but the quality and options would be so much lower now.</p>
<p>So essentially you are calling the devs names for having done a better job.</p>

            <p>All the changes, both subtle and large massively improve the level of polish. The last few years of work really shows. MP5’s new feel alone feels like a game changer. And I could Sprint with the Glock allask day.</p>

</aside>
<p>Some of us wish to work on this game full time to get it up to the quality and standard it deserves. A donation model is not sustainable in the slightest, this has been proven time and time again. The reason any of this has taken so long is because everyone works on a volunteer basis, and has a real life and jobs and well…are human. Not only did going retail give us engine level access; something which isn’t possible without a license, it also allows us to commit more resources to further improving the game to the quality we all want.</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/27908-Black-Mesa-is-now-available-on-Steam-as-an-early-access-title/" data-bbcode="true">This post</a> details just some of the things the retail has which the mod does not. It is substantial, and that list isn’t even close to exhaustive. People who are saying this is the same as the free release 2 years ago are flat out completely wrong.</p>

            <p>If I had put so much blood sweat and tears into a project and produced such amazing result, only to have certain people bitch and moan about it’s $20 price tag, I’m pretty sure I would have deleted certain people’s forum accounts and posts without so much as a second thought.<br>
In contrast, this too is a tribute to the character of the devs.<br>
Well done Crowbar Collective!<br>
I can’t wait to check the game out, and the final chapter when it arrives, and VR edition / mod when it arrives too!<br>

<p>I can imagine the amount of work you must have put in, I definitely appreciate it and I am sure the game will be remembered for a very long time (until someone makes a new remake in about 15 years)   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>All I’m going to say on the matter is that I’m perfectly willing to pay for Black Mesa, but only when it’s finished. So your on my wish list for now but you have to get things done for me to invest.</p>

<p>I would say congrats too, if I wasn’t deceived all along.</p>
<p>Can be sure I’ll spend all the time I’ll happen to dedicate discussing BMS, to boycotting this product.</p>
<p>Reason? You’ve deceived us! You went from “will always be free” to “we have to make you pay a little 'cuz volvo” to “20/25€”.</p>
<p>You’re disgusting, you should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>
<p>Do you want to WORK and EARN with a mod? FINE! But state it from the beginning. I’d be willing to drop you even 30€. But luring me in and then putting on a huge price tag.</p>
<p>You can be sure I’ll be the first seeder of cracked copy. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Have fun with my IP.</p>

</aside>
<p>Honestly? You little piece of shit piss me off! I already bought it cuz i have no problem with 20€. I would also pay 30€ or even 40€. I don’t care about prices if something is worth it. Maybe earning money instead of cracking could be an option to you little poor scum?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Devs</span>: congrats! I can’t wait to see what you have done the past 3 Years!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’m not saying that either you can afford it or you don’t have a job, just that it’s not a steep price at all. I guess “affordable” would be relative, but as far as games of its caliber come, it’s a good deal.</p>
