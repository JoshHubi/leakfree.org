            <p>I enjoyed NH2, but felt it got far too action-orientated towards the end (and that ‘machine’ at the end just plain sucked). <span class="bbcode-i">However,</span> there were some genuine scares - in particular I loved the mannequin area, where they’d keep shifting places when you weren’t looking.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This entire mod was utterly amazing. So much better than FEAR. I beat it exactly 2 Hours after it came out. Been tracking it for ages. I love the random scare system Hen wrote into the game giving the random “pssts” and shadows and effects. Simply amazing. I found all the Easter eggs.</p>
<p>THERE ARE SPOILERS IN HERE!!!</p>
<p>-In chapter two, at the top of the elevator. When it drops, jump on to the support beam and run back to see Hen’s youtube icon.</p>
<p>-There is a “weege” or Luigig thing in the first surgery room before Emily locks the door and then appears in the tiny room to break the glass. Look behind the blue trash can in the corner behind the surgery table.</p>
<p>-In any chapter, if you noclip to the room where Ramero is, he will ask you how you got in there and then yell at you to get out.</p>
<p>-If you noclip into Emily’s dress, shes wearing a bra and panties that say, " She’s dead you sick fuck! NO U!"</p>
<p>-If you take the flashlight next to the swat guy in chapter 7 and go out of the elevator and jump over the desk and continue down the hallway, you can find the announcer. She says, “I do not wish for you to see me like this, please leave NOW!” If you brought the flashlight it will turn on and you can see her shadow.</p>
<ul>
<li>map this_is_not_a_easter_egg</li>
</ul>
<p>-In chapter three, if you noclip past the rubble pile next to the room where you blow the door open, where there is a crashed air vent, in the part of the vent that is sticking out of the wall is Hen’s tag again.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emily’s quotes reversed are warnings and some of them are funny little easter eggs. She says, “This is an Easter Egg!” in one of them.<br>
VIDEO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhB9eDZiQBM&amp;feature=related" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhB9eDZiQBM&amp;feature=related</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In chapter 3 when Ramero comes on the screen saying, “Your alive! I lost you 30 minutes ago.” and he tells you about the air duct. If you run back and forth between the air duct and the room where he tells you about a few times he will say stuff on the screen every time. Eventually he will say something like, “What? You think if you stick around I’ll present you with an Eatser Egg? No!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ramero’s name is kinda an Eater Egg. His name is Ramero and he caused the zombies. Geroge A. Ramero is the greatest Zombie movie maker ever. Just a thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you get to Ramero’s hideout, noclip thru the door that slams shut after hitting E on it. you will hear a cough. if you noclip after the cough, you will see Ramero doing an odd dance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you run outside after the elevator stops and you turn around, the sign said Never Hope Hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the hallway with the nurses shadows that you have to avoid, go into the storage room. If you break the wood support things leaning against the wall in the back with the power generators a buttojn will be revealed. Click it repeatedly until the Uboa appears. It will make a loud noise and teleport you outside the room if you walk into it. the door will then be locked.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m pretty sure that’s all of them. Have fun guys! Amazing mod! Reccomend it to everyone!</p>

<p>I think they should have used the announcement system a little more than they did. It was great when it told you there was something behind you. XD</p>

<p>Holy hell. That was one of two times that I was at the point of jumping out of my chair. My problem: When ever you’re climbing a long ladder or running down a long corridor, pretty easy to assume that there’s going to be something waiting to jump at you.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, the announcement system reminded me of GladOs  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>Kind of scary mod, I found it pulling mindfuck things that other games like F.E.A.R already did… sometimes I was able to predict what would happen such as the skeleton in the vent getting pulled around the corner. But still a very good mod, it was nice to see a game where the military guys DON’T shoot you on sight haha. However once you beat it the game is no longer scary because <em>spoiler spoiler</em>…</p>
<p>However, I still think Afraid of Monsters is scarier. It’s testimate to the saying “less is more.” When something’s simpler and more obscure… and less things are explained, the mystery is kept alive and everything stays scary. If anyone hasn’t played Afraid of Monsters go get it, it’s still one of my all time favorites.</p>

            <p>Some pretty inventive use of look triggers, especially making things happen just outside of your view. Reminded me of a small test-map someone made where something outside a window convinced you to go up to it. When you went over there, nothing was out there. When you turn around, the G-man is silently standing directly in front of you, then disappears.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you check out the other easter egg: At any point, put in the console ‘map this_is_not_an_easter_egg’. Or, just watch a video of it online:<br>
