    <title>Help With DirectSound</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-directsound/3851</link>
    <description>So I am almost done with some code to make a 2D game in C++ and there is only one problem, no sound. I would like to use direct sound but if there is better code to use I&#39;m willing to use it.

All the tutorials I tried online had some compiling error or something else wrong with it so if anyone has an example I could follow, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</description>

            <p>^ Yeah I think I already tried it but it took a lot of system resources, but I’ll try it again. I’m working with OpenAL, and I compiled a few code samples yesterday with no problems. I’m going to write the code today and see how well it works.</p>

            <p>The most simple way to do this would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PlaySound("sound.wav", NULL, SND_ASYNC | SND_FILENAME);</code></pre>
<p>This should work for simple purposes.  <span class="bbcode-b">SND_ASYNC</span> means the sound plays asynchronously, which means the program execution will continue when the sound plays.  The opposite is SND_SYNC.  <span class="bbcode-b">SND_FILENAME</span> means the sound is played from a file.  The other option is playing a sound from a Windows resource, but that I will not explain here.  In any case, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+PlaySound" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Google is your friend</a>.</p>
<p>If somehow this doesn’t suffice for your program (for example, when you need two sounds playing at the same time), then yes - have a look at DirectSound.  Again, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=C%2B%2B+Directsound" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Google is your friend</a>.</p>
<p>P.S:  you would be better off looking for a good C++ forum. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
