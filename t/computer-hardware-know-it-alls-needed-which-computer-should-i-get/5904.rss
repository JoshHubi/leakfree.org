    <title>Computer hardware know - it - alls needed, which computer should I get?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-hardware-know-it-alls-needed-which-computer-should-i-get/5904</link>
    <description>I have been in the market for a new PC, and initial searching turned up a fairly inexpensive (comparably) computer with decent specs

However, doing a little more digging, I found what SEEMS to be a better computer for considerably less :

My question is, is the less expensive one (second link) actually BETTER than the first? Or am I missing something rather important that could come around to bite me in the ass later on?</description>

<p>Like someone else said on here (I think) building a computer is pretty much a more technical version of Legos.  Buy the parts (and folks on here will assist with picking them) put them together, install your OS and take pride in what you’ve done.  I’ve built at least 6 for myself over the past 10 years, plus at least 2 dozen when I worked at a PC repair center, plus 2-3 for family/friends.  It’s a fun learning experience  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>I agree, build your own. It’s surprisingly fun to do, although it sometimes gets kind of tedious. And you’ll be able to say your computer was 100% built and customized by you.</p>

            <p>The cheaper one is better. The ATI 5770 is faster than the gt 220, and it has a 6 core processor.<br>
On the downside there aren’t any reviews so you may be taking a chance.</p>
