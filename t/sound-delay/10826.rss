    <title>Sound delay</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sound-delay/10826</link>
    <description>Hi, thanks for game.

Bug: every sound effects (steps,gunshot,reloading) are a bit resynchronized. It could be 0,2-0.5sec late i guess. Not much but enough to feel odd.
I dont have this problem in any other game. Not even source-based ones like TF2 or HL2.

My specs: Core 2 Quad, HD5850, Win7 64bit, Creative Xfi, 4G ram DDR2</description>
