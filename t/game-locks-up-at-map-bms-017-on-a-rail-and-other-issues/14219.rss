    <title>Game Locks Up at Map BMS-017 (ON A RAIL) and Other Issues</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-locks-up-at-map-bms-017-on-a-rail-and-other-issues/14219</link>
    <description>Greetings,

I am running the latest patch released June 15, 2015.

Issue #1: The game locks up during ON A RAIL the moment that Map BMS-017** loads. I have to CTRL-ALT-DEL just to get out of BM. Even if I &quot;cheat&quot; and use the console to load this map, it still crashes upon loading.

Issue #2: If I use the console to load a map, I lose the ability to use the tilde key (~) to access the console. I must use the ESC key instead.

Issue #3: Constant &quot;swoosh&quot; sound whenever I press either E or ENTER keys.

** Regarding Map BMS-017: I&#39;m reasonably certain that this is the troublesome map that locks at the very beginning. In case it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s the one that loads *after* completing the map where the old rail car takes a dive into the water, you swim up, you fight a bunch of soldiers, you meet a scientist in a control room overlooking the cage over some water, and you use the crossbow (tranquilizer) to defeat the big fish-monster. Then you travel on foot along some more rails to load Map BMS-017.

I&#39;ll acknowledge that I&#39;m no coding professional; writing is my racket. However, if you&#39;re going to charge to play a game, then the game should function. Unless I can be assured that a patch fixing at least the map-locking issue will be forthcoming reasonably soon, I&#39;ll be forced to request a refund from Steam. I have no desire to do this, because Black Mesa is a damned great game and it&#39;s obvious that you folks put in a lot of time to bring an old classic up to present-day game engine standards.

Looking forward to the next patch.

Regards,

Shadekur</description>

            <p>“All files successfully verified.”</p>
<p>Game still crashes as soon as that map opens.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>It’s not my strength either (and I’m sure someone on here who knows way more than me will answer soon), but I think the process will check if your files are correctly downloaded and if not, it will download the ones that are not.<br>
Just open your Steam library, right click on Black Mesa, then properties, and then under the tab Local Files click on Verify Integrity of Game Cache.</p>

            <p>Please forgive me if I ask for further clarification, as my forte is writing and not information technology.</p>
<p>How exactly would I check the integrity of my game cache? What should I look for? And what should I do if I should find this evidence?</p>

            <p>That would be map bm_c2a3c I suppose. There’s probably some problem with your installation of the game because I’m able to load that map, at least from the console.<br>
Try to check the integrity of your game cache (it’s in the Local Files tab of Black Mesa’s proprieties in Steam’s library) or try to redownload the game.</p>

            <p>Sorry…I’m not trying to artificially inflate my number of posts.</p>
<p>I’ve just read Cpl 1nsane’s post regarding bug-reporting. Here is the entire contents of my dump file:</p>
<p>crash_bms.exe_20150616111032_1.dmp<br>
crash_bms.exe_20150616111330_1.dmp<br>
crash_bms.exe_20150616111425_1.dmp<br>
crash_bms.exe_20150616114558_1.dmp<br>
crash_bms.exe_20150616150818_1.dmp</p>
<p>You’ll find that ALL of these occurred upon immediately loading the same map.</p>

            <p>I forgot to add one minor but curious note that I received from the game console when I attempted to load BMS-017:</p>
<p>“File not found”.</p>
<p>Did we accidentally leave this map out of the current patch? </p>
