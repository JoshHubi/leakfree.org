    <title>Interested in Building a PC</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/interested-in-building-a-pc/5161</link>
    <description>I most likely won&#39;t get around to it for a little bit, though. I just want to get some suggestions and pointers since a lot of people on here seem to be very knowledgeable on the subject. This is a game computer btw. So, without further ado, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve picked so far:

Processor:[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0337971&#39;]Intel Core i7 875K Unlocked 2.93GHz LGA 1156[/url] $299.99

RAM:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0311100&#39;]XMS3 6GB DDR3-1600 (PC-12800) CL8 Memory Kit (Three 2GB Memory Modules)[/url] $179.99

Graphics Card:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0342969&#39;]Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX470[/url] $330 after rebate

Motherboard:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0326528&#39;]Asus[/url][url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0326528&#39;]P7H55-M PRO Socket 1156 H55 mATX Motherboard[/url] $94.99

Power Supply:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0334161&#39;]Corsair[/url][url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0334161&#39;]GS600 Gaming Series High Performance 600 Watt ATX Power Supply[/url]$79.99 after rebate

Hard Drive:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0340391&#39;]Seagate[/url][url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0340391&#39;]Barracuda 7200.12 ST31000528AS 1TB 7,200 RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s 3.5&quot; Internal Hard Drive - OEM[/url] $69.99

Case:
[url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0334159&#39;]Gigabyte[/url][url=&#39;https://www.microcenter.com/single_product_results.phtml?product_id=0334159&#39;]GZ-PH2A30 Mid-Tower Chassis - Black[/url] $24.99

Total Cost before Discount: $1080

I&#39;m buying from that site (well the store most likely) because I get a discount there.

Any suggestions on stuff I should change or stuff that needs to be added is appreciated. And I realize that I haven&#39;t yet picked a monitor  :stuck_out_tongue:  .</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Been looking around at different motherboards and found <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813188055" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> one. It supports RAM up to 2600MHz, though I can’t find a list of supported brands.</p>
<p>Edit: Though it doesn’t support ATI Crossfire. Hm…</p>
<p>You know, I’m just going to get the other motherboard with the 9-9-9-24 RAM. I’m sure it doesn’t make that much of a difference.</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.469071" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This</a> combo looks pretty cool. And the motherboard supports <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-231-189&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=1&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Page=2#scrollFullInfo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> memory which is 8-8-8-21. Hopefully the combo is still around when I get them.</p>

            <p>Its also pretty mediocre, they supposedly only have 4 Dimms setup on 1155 motherboards.<br>
it pretty much is the 1156 with nicer cpu design as of yet, which is why 1366 is better imo and 1366 will have a nice life.</p>
<p>I say.</p>

<p>Hmm.  Hadn’t even heard about the 1155 yet, but then, I’ve been busy researching all the stuff for the system I built 3 weeks ago.  Plus I don’t usually keep too close of an eye on stuff that’s coming out in the future, unless it’s something REALLY worth waiting on.  As it is, I think an i7-930 running at 4gHz will keep me computing happily for a while  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I don’t want to keep advising you to get parts that are more expensive, but at the same time, if you’re going to do it, you should do it right.  That said, if you’re still set on getting the 1156 platform, I’d recommend <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820145261" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this RAM</a>.  It natively supports DDR3 1600 (although you might have to adjust your RAM voltage and timings in the BIOS to reach that speed), and at that speed (1600+, 1.6V), a CAS latency of 9-9-9-24 isn’t bad at all.  I’m running <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231225" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this kit</a> at 1748mHz, 1.6V and 8-9-9-24.</p>
<p>As for PCI-E2.1, I think it has to do with running two full x16 PCI-E lanes (if you run two videocards) but I’m not positive (I’ve been doing a lot of reading, don’t remember what articles I’ve read and have LOTS of information floating in my brain  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> )</p>

Also consider - i7-930 ($199) + 6GB DDR3 kit ($140) + 1366 Mobo (~$200) = $540.  i5-750 ($160) + Mobo (~$160) + 8GB DDR3 kit ($180) = $500.  It’s worth getting the 8GB of RAM for the 1156 platform, since 4GB really isn’t enough for Win7 + newer games.  So $40 gets you a LOT more performance, plus a more future-proof platform with room to upgrade to a 6-core proc, SATA6, USB3, etc.</p>

<p>MSI and Asus are my favorite mobo manufacturers.  If you want future proofing, this board is good - two SATA6 connectors, two USB3.0 ports, so in the event you upgrade down the line (without replacing the CPU/RAM/Mobo) you can at least get better drives and external devices.</p>
<p>However, the 1156 platform is pretty much done already - from what I’ve read, Intel doesn’t plan to do much with it.  So for the future, 1366 is a “better” investment.  Also consider - i7-930 ($199) + 6GB DDR3 kit ($140) + 1366 Mobo (~$200) = $540.  i5-750 ($160) + Mobo (~$160) + 8GB DDR3 kit ($180) = $500.

<p>Final choice is up to you though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just look for a few things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>size (mATX / ATX etc)</li>
<li>CPU socket(s) number</li>
<li>how many PCI-e slots</li>
<li>maximum amount of memory / what memory is supported</li>
<li>onboard sound?</li>
<li>how many HDD’s can I install</li>
<li>support for SLI/Tri-SLI/Quad-SLI/Crossfire/CrossfireX</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on… Really not that difficult.</p>

            <p>If you want 100% tests, look it up on internet, cause in real time, that pretty much doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Its only ever peaked once at 86 Degrees Celcius</p>
<p>its average for real time use is about 60-75 Degress Celcius.</p>
<p>(example, Crysis Maxed, Metro etc.)</p>
<p>Not worried about power consumption, im using a Corsair HX-750 atm, and plan to go silverstone 1500 later. so its not a problem.</p>

            <p>Guys if its any reconciliation, I own Viper Raptor 1600Mhz (7-7-7-20) XMP Tri-channel DDR3, those timings are stock.</p>
<p>Also, what tempratures are you lot expecting nvidia cards to run at. i got a gtx 480 and my temps are fine.</p>

<p>Well, after looking through the employee discount thing I only get a discount on the power supply, CPU fan, disc drive, and case. I’ll most likely get the case on Newegg, however, though the rest I’ll probably get at the store. They have crappy motherboards and RAM.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking through it, some manufacturers of the Radeon HD 5870 sell it for hundreds of dollars cheaper than others. Do the cards really have that much of a difference depending on the manufacturer?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not really, some come with custom cooling or factory overclocks ensuring a performance increase without voiding warranty. It’s not worth the money though, just buy the stock model and overclock it yourself. XFX and EVGA are probably the most popular, but there are plenty of others with good warranty.</p>

            <p>For a mid-tower I’d recommend something like the Antec 300 Illusion.  Comes with 3x120mm fans and 1x140mm fan, pretty decent cable management, and is only $60 on NewEgg (during promos, which are often, currently it’s $70).</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t have a CPU backplane cutout, isn’t tool-less (if you like that kind of setup), and isn’t painted on the interior (minor detail).  You may also consider the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146065&amp;cm_re=nzxt-_-11-146-065-_-Product" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NZXT Vulcan</a> - same price as the Antec 300, has a carrying handle (good for hefting it around, i.e. LAN parties or tough-to-reach desk corners), and has some nicer details the Antec 300 lacks (painted interior, CPU backplane cutout, grometed water cooling holes).</p>
<p>As for the RAM timings, I have a 1600 DDR3 kit and I’m running at 8-8-8-24.  From what I’ve read, though, RAM timings and mHz (i.e. 1333 vs 1600) in general don’t have that much of an impact on performance.  And I haven’t overclocked and crunched the numbers enough to give you an educated opinion of my own.</p>
