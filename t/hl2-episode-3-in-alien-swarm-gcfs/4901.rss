    <description>Looks like a steam forum member (StickZer0) found evidence about Episode 3 in the new free game Alien Swarm. [url=&#39;https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=16203270&amp;postcount=1&#39;]His Post[/url]:

Check this out for yourself guys, open the Alien Swarm SDK, place an info_node_hint and check the hint options.

What on earth is a Blob Brain? Or an Aperture Nest?

I don&#39;t know whether this proves Episode 3 or not, but I believe it&#39;s definitely evidence they&#39;re working on it!

Finally something about Episode 3 (I hope).  :slight_smile:</description>

And judging by the hints for Blob_brain, it seems to be a director type entity that could very well control the swarm’s strategies in AS.<br>
And of course there are the snow textures in AS, but that means nothing. There are snow textures in HL2, does that mean it has Episode 3 content? No, it means the base source content has materials from the HL2 beta.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you’ve looked at the image in the first post, you’d understand why this is probably EP3 content. The info_node_hints with the prefix EP3. Aside from Episode 3, I don’t see what else it could possibly mean. Especially when Episode 2 sdk content is often abbreviated as EP2.</p>
<p>And if you’ve seen at least one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9_-odxqzg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">videos of NPC_Surface from the leaked source benchmark,</a> you’d understand why I might think this has something to do with the hydra, especially considering that the npc itself gives an error that it’s missing Hydra.mdl</p>
<p>One of the main reasons that the hydra was cut from HL2(asside from being no fun) was that the AI was buggy &amp; bad. It’s probable that the Brain of the hydra(the part that you need to hurt) is NPC_Blob. This way, rather than having multiple ugly polygonal tentacles being controlled by a single npc, they could have each individual tentacle be it’s own npc &amp; have them directed by their core. If NPC_Blob was an entity in ASW used to direct ai with no physical presence in the world, then there’s no need for it to be an NPC.</p>

</aside>
<p>Your rebuttal may be “the most common” but that just make it the most common misconception. Hundreds of people can say the world is flat, but that doesn’t mean it’s true. They redid large sections of HL2 repeatedly because those parts sucked. I know this, because the WC Map pack contains many of the maps used in the final game that replaced the ones seen in the E3 videos. THAT WOULDN’T MAKE ANY SENSE IF THAT CHANGER WERE CAUSED BY THE LEAK. It also didn’t take them “several more years” to complete, it only took 1. And that was after another delay that was announced in July.</p>

<p>NPC_Blob &amp; NPC_Surface were from a leaked particle benchmark.

That Alien Swarm .fgd info certainly helps my theory that the hydra will be brought back for EP3 as two separate npcs.

            <p>i’d also like to point out at this time that any time someone finds code that valve left or forgot to take out valve usually gets burned by it and has to redo most (if not all) of the said game.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>im not saying this is <span class="bbcode-u">THAT</span> huge but still nice to see people actively looking for code leaks then complains when valve has to start something from scratch. nice job assholes</p>
<p>you want a hint, ill give you one free of charge: stop trying to find things about episode 3 or else you might fuck episode 3 up:fffuuu:</p>

<p>He went to the portal staff and does map development for them. He also made the Portal 2 ARG. I talk to him from time to time and I’m pretty sure his primary focus is Portal2 and does a bit for EP3. I’ve never heard him mention L4D. I could be wrong though.</p>

            <p>I’m guessing those must be code fragments from an earlier attempt at Ep3. After all, initially upon hiring, Adam Foster of MINERVA was supposedly working on the game before being transferred into the Left 4 Dead staff.</p>
<p>Potentially this could be an evolution on the cut tentacle monster in the Half Life 2 beta? After all, the game allegedly will involve the Borealis, so we can expect concepts and locations that were cut from HL2’s initial release to potentially make their way into the game.</p>
<p>Now if they put the Cremator back in, I’ll be really happy.</p>
