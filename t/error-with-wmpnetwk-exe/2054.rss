    <title>Error with wmpnetwk.exe</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/error-with-wmpnetwk-exe/2054</link>
    <description>Just to let you guys and gals know, in windows 7 windows media center might try to setup a file sharing network. It will open up this background program wmpnetwk.exe which is the Windows media player file sharing network service. It will take about 2.5GB of ram. If you come across this problem, disable the program by going into &quot;services&quot; in the start menu and right clicking on properties of wmpnetwk.exe and click in the text box and click disable to disable it. If you don&#39;t disable it will waste resources and really slow down the computer.</description>
