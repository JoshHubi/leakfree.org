    <title>Steam Accounts Are Being Hacked!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-accounts-are-being-hacked/4586</link>
    <description>Okay, today I was chilling on Youtube when my friend IM me on STEAM. His message was:
&quot;Hey! Can you join my steam community? [www.steamcommunity.com/profile_989777964/tk](https://www.steamcommunity.com/profile_989777964/tk).&quot;
Or something along those lines. Not sure if that is a real link.
DO NOT GO TO THESE LINKS!!!!
I have had three friends get hacked over the past four months.
What happens is they will message you on a stolen account and say things like:
&quot;Hey! Is this your community profile? *Bogus link here.*&quot; 
Or:
&quot;Hey! I can&#39;t believe how many points you have on this game! Your profile is amazing! *Bogus link here.*&quot; 
I have also gotten other messages similar to these.
You click these links and it will take you to a website. It will probably have the STEAM logo in the corner and it actually looks really legit. It has *NAME* and *PASSWORD* boxes and says, &quot;Please Log Into STEAM To View User Profile.&quot; Or something along those lines. DO NOT LOG IN!
This is a fake website made by someone who is trying to hack accounts. You log in and it will say &quot;Log In Failed.&quot; or something like that. They now have your username and password. Next time your offline they will come in and steal your account by changing your password. Another one of my friends got hacked today because they messaged me with that first message I stated previously.
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]HOW TO STAY SAFE:[/SIZE]
1.) First of all, you should know not to log on on anything other than STEAM itself and [url]https://www.valvesoftware.com[/url].
2.) Keep an eye out. The &quot;tk.&quot; will give it away. Anything with &quot;tk&quot; in it is bullshit. Don&#39;t log on to anything ending with &quot;tk.&quot;
3.) Be smart. If you get these links, don&#39;t trust them. Report them. 



We need to do something about all these hackers out there. We pay hard earned money for our STEAM games. You have no right to take that from us. 

Thanks
