            <p>I would close this, but then there would not be a perfect example to others as to what should be a thread and what should not be a thread.</p>
<p>OR… if you create a thread, you must take responcibility for it. Even if everyone else are the ones that feck it up with useless crap rather than just stick with the intentions. Hrm… sorta like raising kids. You can put all your good will and intentions in them, but in the end they are the ones to turn on you and flip you the bird.</p>
<p>I need coffee.</p>

<p>your friend looks nothing like Alyx.</p>
<p>I personally don’t think Alyx and Jamil Mullen look that similar. except a <span class="bbcode-i">bit</span> in that pic of her with the long hair.</p>
