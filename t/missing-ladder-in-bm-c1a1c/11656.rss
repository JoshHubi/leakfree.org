    <description>Hi,

first of all let me congratulate you guys on creating/finishing this mod. Ive been looking forward to playing this since I read about it in a magazine in 2006, Ive been constantly checking your website every few months, and watched the trailers dozens of times. I even applied for the voice actorsback then. But enough of that...To my problem: It seems a ladder is gone in my game.

[url]https://cdn01.trixum.de/upload2/p/x/pxbTwXY5jh3o135230600273P1546.jpg[/url]

Here is the data you need:

hostname: Half-Life 2
version : 1.0.1.0/14 4104 insecure  
map     : bm_c1a1c at: -3216 x, -2416 y, -1355 z


setpos -3216.000732 -2416.000732 -1355.968750;setang -57.836437 -34.675030 0.000000

I hope you can help me get back in the game  :slight_smile:

            <p>btw, in case its not clear to see on the screenshots: I did of course use the valve to make the water rise.</p>
<p>I had a look at the walkthrough on <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Unforeseen_Consequences" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Unforeseen_Consequences</a> as well, and did what he did there.</p>
<p>still, no ladder</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
this is not a missing object or something.<br>
The scene that you have shown is correct.<br>
If you are there jump down (like in your screens)<br>
you need to find a valve and open it!<br>
Water will increase, and you can swim back to the main area</p>
