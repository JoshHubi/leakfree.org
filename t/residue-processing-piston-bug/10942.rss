Hello again,

When I got up to the section just after you walk onto the conveyor belt on the residue processing level, with two sets of three pistons you must evade, I ran into a bug.

The first set of pistons was timed ok, I got through first try, but the second set of pistons were out of time, and the last two of the three came down almost together. This made it impossible to get through (I tried various run / run crouch combinations). I waited to see if the timing changed, but they remained in the same configuration, and I ended up having to use god mode to get through.

getpos details: 
setpos -988.288757 799.996765 583.531250;setang 6.232607 -1.683440 0.000000

I&#39;ve included a screenshot of the pistons.

            <p>Or (if you don’t care for achievements) you can go into the console, type “sv_cheats 1” then “god”, go through the pistons unharmed, and then type “god” and “sv_cheats 0” into the console again. However, <span class="bbcode-b">this will break achievements for the rest of the game</span>.</p>

            <p>I posted that. You have to load back to the auto save of when the map started. And immediately throw the switch and go through the pistons. The kill triggers seem to go out of sync with the pistons over time.</p>
