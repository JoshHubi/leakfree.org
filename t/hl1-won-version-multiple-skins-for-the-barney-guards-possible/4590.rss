    <title>[HL1 WON Version] Multiple Skins for the &quot;Barney&quot; guards possible?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl1-won-version-multiple-skins-for-the-barney-guards-possible/4590</link>
    <description>I recently got back into re skinning in Goldsrc and I was playing around and thought that having the &quot;Barney&quot;s with bloodstains, scratches, dirty clothes etc., would look cool, but when I added in the skin I noticed a problem: It doesn&#39;t make much sense before the Resonance Cascade. So what I want is to be able to have the guards (and maybe scientists) get progressively dirty and/or bloody as the game passes. Y&#39;know, clean at the start, and in &quot;Unforeseen Consequences&quot; everyone&#39;s a little bloodshot, maybe some scratches. I was thinking a slightly more bloody/dirty look with each passing chapter. Would this be possible? And if so, would it require alot (or any) coding? I&#39;m not good with coding at all, and I like this idea.
Thanks ahead.

(Also a side thing I&#39;d like, would it be possible in HL: S To get Barneys helmet reflecting the environment like some other models in Source Games? I want the helmet texture static for detail, but it reflects the environment textures, thanks ahead...Again)</description>

            <p>Make a mod for it.</p>
<p>Call it “Half-Life: Progressively Dirtier Characters Edition”</p>

            <p>Or you could go out of game and switch the skin each chapter but again it would be annoying.</p>

            <p>I don’t think it would be possible without manually going through the entire game and setting different entities for each guard.</p>
