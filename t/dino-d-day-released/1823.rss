Also, games <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">[COLOR=‘Red’]SHOULD NOT</span></span></span> all be ridiculously easy, having to think about a game is one of the things that can make it enjoyable.</p>

<p>I’m sick and tired of people pretending everybody is born with the same mindset and thinking.</p>
<p>Some things that come natural to you might not come natural to others. Show some empathy for once!</p>
<p>All games should have a “complete beginners” mode which will tell you in clear text what to do everywhere.</p>

            <p>Well it seems as though they made the end clear enough- i would’ve read the end text but I was being eaten so I couldn’t concentrate.</p>
<p>the action, really, just does -not- let up- it’s worse than Left 4 Dead, So god damn unrelenting to have to take on a T-rex, Nazi soldiers and a gang of malcontent raptor youths without much of a clue as to what to do.</p>
<p>As a bonus point I had no idea you had to get the T-rex to ram the bridge until it happened naturally after blowing at least a thousand rounds into the god damned thing.</p>

            <p>It’s also going to have a commercial release! I’ll download this later but the premise (and screenshots) are awesome!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
