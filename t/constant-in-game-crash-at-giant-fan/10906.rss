    <title>Constant in-game crash at giant fan</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/constant-in-game-crash-at-giant-fan/10906</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not really sure how much info you guys need besides the minidump, the exact timing of the crash is once I turn the giant fan on, I have about 10 seconds before it crashes, regardless of where I move towards.

If any more information is required I&#39;ll be glad to include it!

            <p>Thanks for confirming, nice to know that this solution worked for yet another person suffering from this bug. Definitelly a bug in the BM or in Source engine, most probably related to physics calculations.</p>

<p>Thanks! I figured it’d be a widespread thing but couldn’t find anything on the previous couple of pages, never thought of using the search function.</p>
<p>Incase anyone else runs into this: I threw down all the objects down the abyss, since the objects being blown into a specific direction by the fan was probably causing the crash. Problem is now solved for me atleast!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
