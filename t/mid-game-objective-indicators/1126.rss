    <title>Mid-Game Objective Indicators</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mid-game-objective-indicators/1126</link>
    <description>I was just discussing this mod with a friend, and then go into the Half-Life vs Half-Life 2 debate. We both decided that Half-Life 1 was a much better game, but neither of us had ever beaten it. Due to the fact that we were both quite young and confused during some missions and got hooked on Counter-Strike, we quit Half-Life before ever completing it. During this conversation, it occurred to me that mid-mission objective indicators didn&#39;t really exist in games back in &#39;98/&#39;99. We both came to the conclusion that, with some helpful objective indicators during missions, Half-Life would have been an absolutely perfect game.

So my suggestion is that you should toy around with the idea of implementing mid-mission objective indicators or hints or something at various checkpoints during the game. Nothing is worse than running around for 15 minutes in the same hallways because you&#39;ve forgotten to press one button. Perhaps the indicators could be used to correct the user when they are doing something improperly. Let&#39;s say that I have already completed Mission A and am attempting to head towards Mission B, but have wandered off in the wrong direction. Once I complete Mission A, some indicator check points will be activated in the hallways which I am not supposed to back track, and will point me in the correct direction. Or you could simply fill the game with checkpoints that will spawn objective hits or tips.

For those of you who know the game like the back of your hand (you know who you are :p) and don&#39;t need these indicators, there could easily be a button in the options menu to disable hints... or even a button that could be pressed to display the previous hint.

Feedback?  :smiley:</description>

<p>Similarly, if you stop playing the game for two days and don’t remember what you were doing last, then the problem is clearly your memory’s not what it should be.</p>
<p>Come on. Half-Life. Objective indicators. Seriously.</p>

</aside>
<p>While it’s true that there really isn’t that much story in Half-Life, there are plenty of memorable events (some more important then others) that could be easily be milestones, but somewhere around the middle of the game the events seem to blur to me. The events are there, they just need to be made more definitive. And after these events it’s usually the best times to have a reminder.</p>

</aside>
<p>The thing is, I do listen to everything the scientists have to say, the problem is that for long stretches of time they either have nothing relevant to say, or there aren’t any around at all. Not to say that there should be scientists running around everywhere, but if I see them after a few hours of isolation, I’d hope they’d say something a bit more helpful then “do you know who ate all the donuts?”</p>

That’s as dumb as saying that the game doesn’t need the first two chapters, and the ending because ‘everyone’ who’s going to play it already knows what happens.:retard:</p>

Part of your problems seems to be that you’re expecting there to be more storyline in HL1 than there actually is. Much of HL1 was simply the story of a single theoretical physicist beating all odds and managing to survive against alien invasion, government conspiracy with the laws of physics crumbling around all of them. As for keeping track of the individual goals, try LISTENING to the scientists and security guards, as they ARE actually more than just cannon fodder and door openers.<br>
If you’re having trouble remembering things because of how little game time you have, try opening a notepad file on your computer and TAKE NOTES. If these notes were handled by the game itself, then that would kill half the immersion of the game, as “Gordon Freeman” would know what his goals are, but you would likely STILL be lost even WITH the in-game notes. As it currently stands, if YOU are simply bumbling your way through the game, then you can also assume that “gordon freeman” is ALSO bumbling his way through these events as well. This is critically important to capturing the mood of HL.</p>

            <p>Nah, one of the strengths of HL1 was the way all the objectives were presented to you implicitly, in the game itself.  As everyone says, its more immersive that way.</p>
<p>One thing I <em>didn’t</em> like about HL2 though was that most of the game I had no clue where I was going or why I was going there, other than the fact the structure of the game was sending me that way for no logical reason.  It was kind of funny, perhaps deliberately so, the way other characters had such faith that ‘you’ Gordon, knew exactly what to do and how to solve everything, when in reality you are thinking ‘I dunno, I’ve no clue whatsoever what the hell is going on, what I’m doing here, how I got here, or why I’m going in this direction’.</p>
<p>Good job Gordon never spoke or he’d have given away how totally clueless he really was.  Keep your mouth shut and appear as if you know what you are doing - one of the many life lessons found in video games.</p>
<p>I still don’t really understand what was going on in the plot of HL2 (why was I put on a train that appeared to be sending me to imprisonment and doom till Barney just randomly happened to save me?  Why didn’t Barney just throw me a rope and let me back into the first transporter lab and save me a huge diversion?)</p>
<p>But in HL1 I seem to remember mostly knowing where I was going and why most of the time, so I don’t think any change is needed.</p>

            <p>I think that the friendly reminders shoulden’t be signs but people like security guards or scientists who tell you to go there and do this before they get killed or bleed to death. :freeman: they had those in the original game but more would help.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All Valve games - Half-Life included - are famous for their character acting and direction.  If you listen to Valve’s commentary in HL2 and the episodes, they tell you numerous times that NPCs subtly give hints to players who have become stuck.  The BM devs have proven themselves capable of working up to Valve’s standards, so I don’t see why they would skimp on this aspect.  And Valve’s method is <span class="bbcode-i">much</span> better than inane pop-up messages.</p>

<p>Okay, I’m a dolt.  I’ve been playing Half Life for years and didn’t realize that.  I must have done the tentacle room in Blast Pit a 100 times without knowing that it couldn’t see me.  My methodology was to run like hell tossing grenades across the room and getting through the room as quickly as possible and into the surrounding corridors, quicksaving often.

<p>:fffuuu:</p>
<p>As for the room with the crates hanging (what Ross Scott’s Gordon Freeman calls the “Box Smashing Room”), I actually have an idea what the room was meant for:</p>
<p>At the top of the ladder is a catwalk where crates come up.  Originally, there was a floor but it was destroyed in the RC.  Anyway, the crates open from the side and you could load or unload materials.  At the bottom of the room, the crates are passed through an opening which leads to a shaft that leads up to the surface.  It’s a delivery staging area.  And, since Black Mesa also has military style equipment (see the rocket during the tram ride), this is the room that they store the high explosives, just in case they go off – the walls are metal, y’see, thick metal able to withstand a nuclear blast.</p>
<p>Well, that’s my theory anyway.</p>
