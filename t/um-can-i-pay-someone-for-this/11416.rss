    <title>Um.. Can I pay someone for this?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/um-can-i-pay-someone-for-this/11416</link>
    <description>Like is there a place to make donations or something?  I almost feel guilty playing something this awesome for free and would gladly make a donation to help support the people that put this together.

I skimmed around this site for a bit but didn&#39;t see any means to donate.  

Thx in advance to anyone that helps me out.</description>

            <p>If you’re so hellbent on giving them money (and not a charity, you demon) you can always <a href="https://www.blackmesasource.com/soundtrack.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">buy the soundtrack.</a> The money only goes to Joel Nielson, though. Whether he shares any of that with the rest of the team (or if they simply don’t take it) is all them. I’m sure about 7 million will cover the expenses, but it’s up to you, really.</p>

            <p>The only way you can pay them back is by giving something back… By that i mean you could perhaps do bug reporting… work on improving content or just giving feedback.</p>
<p>Ultimatley it is for free but i feel in debt to them so i am doing my payback because i really appreciate their extremely hard work</p>

            <p>The developers are not taking any donations. I’m sure they appreciate the sentiment, however  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
