    <title>[Crash] Lambda complex coolant tower 1</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-lambda-complex-coolant-tower-1/9905</link>
    <description>I found a spot that always causes a crash. In Lambda complex at coolant tower one, going towards pump station 1. Start by climbing the ladder at the back of coolant tower 1 (the one that is lit with red lights). Then go to the next ladder in the middle of the room on an elevated platform (going near it causes some guys to spawn). After killing the guys go up that ladder. When you get up you will see another ladder lit with red lights - trying to get to there will cause a crash.</description>

            <p>I think May found a way around the crash. if you go back main hall and do the second part first then go back to the spot it crashes and save it normally “not quick save” does not crash.</p>
