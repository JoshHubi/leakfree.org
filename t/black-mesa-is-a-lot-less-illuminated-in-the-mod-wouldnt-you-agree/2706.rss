    <title>Black Mesa is a lot less illuminated in the mod, wouldn&#39;t you agree?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-is-a-lot-less-illuminated-in-the-mod-wouldnt-you-agree/2706</link>
    <description>There are a lot more shadows and a lot less general illumination in the mod&#39;s rendition of Black Mesa. 

I was watching the media when I realized it. There&#39;s black everywhere, in contrast to the original Black Mesa.

Was this made in order to make the game scarier? Maybe it was for realism..?</description>

<li>How about no. Like the majority of people on the internet, you probably don’t even know what a bsp <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">is</span></span>, let alone how to make one.<br>
EDIT: Oh, that pic hadn’t loaded when I typed this.<br>
haha, sorry, didn’t realize you were joking because of that.</li>

            <p>Indeed.  They’re not using color correction.  At least as of that post… could have changed for all I know.</p>
