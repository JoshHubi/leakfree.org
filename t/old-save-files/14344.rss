    <description>Hi guys!
Iv played BMS since 2012...
But yestardey, I download new Early Accses version (0.1.1)
And when I try to load old save file, its crushed... On &quot;connecting&quot; period of load.
Also when I creat new save file its load perfectly, but not with old saves.

How I can fix this problem and load on this new version my good-old saves?)

Please, its very important for me.

Sorry for bad English, Im russian.</description>

            <p>Old saves will definitely never work. Even saves from previous patches on the retail version do not work properly.</p>
<p>If you want to start a new game from whatever chapter you were on in the mod release, you can use the console command:</p>
<p>sv_unlockedchapters 15</p>
<p>On the main menu, and this will unlock all chapters. You can then start a new game from whatever chapter you were on before.</p>

            <p>Old saves will not work on new versions because the new version is essentially a different game.  You will have to start a new game.  If the chapter you were on is still available to you,  you can start there.</p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
