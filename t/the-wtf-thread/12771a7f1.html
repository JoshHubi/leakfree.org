<blockquote>
<p>If you’ve ever been fired for posting a nude picture of yourself on the Internet, or for writing homophobic rants on Facebook, there’s a man who says he is willing to die outside of the Supreme Court for you.</p>
<p>Brian Zulberti, a lawyer from Delaware, is a day and a half into a hunger strike on the sidewalk to promote a simple belief: that our social lives and professional lives should be separate by law.</p>
<p>“This is about privacy and the advancement of technology,” says Zulberti, sitting in a reclining beach chair, wearing a hat that says “Us Versus Them” and a shirt with a picture of him posing shirtless in front of the Capitol Building. “Soon it will be the total information age, privacy out the window. The best we can do is adapt the law to the future now so we don’t turn into 1984, George Orwell style.”</p>
<p>Older couples walked by Zulberti without a second thought. But groups of students stopped, chatted, gave him high fives and wished him luck. A few years from entering the job market, they could relate.</p>
<p>Zulberti has been down this road before. He was fired as a high school tennis coach for comments he posted on a website about an opposing player. He became a minor viral sensation in 2013 when he applied for jobs in the state, not by sending out a resume, but by sending a picture of himself in a rolled-up t-shirt. He then posted a picture of himself in his underwear onto Facebook with a handwritten sign begging someone to hire him “as a lawyer. Damn, NOT A (sic) ESCORT.”</p>
<p>What might look like a dumb stunt and a way to guarantee continued unemployment for most, was a patriotic mission to Zulberti. He says he has posted a number of naked photos of himself online, and wants the right to keep doing it — without consequences to his (currently stalled) career.</p>
<p>“Look, if I’ve got to get your eyes to my penis to see the problems with the nation,” he says, “then so be it.”</p>
<p>Before coming to the Supreme Court, Zulberti — a graduate of the Villanova Law School — has been traveling across the country trying to draw attention to cases of people being fired for their social media presence. Recently, he went to New Jersey to talk about the case of Sam Falcetano, a Department of Public Works employee fired for writing homophobic posts on Facebook. Zulberti, who says he is “about as gay as the day is long,” said in a blog post that he may wish horrible things upon the man, but still doesn’t believe he should have been fired.</p>
<p>Christopher Calabrese, the legislative counsel for privacy-related issues at the American Civil Liberties Union in D.C., says this isn’t a cut-and-dry issue. Yes, the ACLU is fighting to make it so no one should be “coercing you to share information that you haven’t shared freely” such as social media passwords.</p>
<p>“Just like your employer can’t come to your house to check it out before they hire you, they shouldn’t be able to check out your digital house,” he says. But as for what you post out into the world for other people to see, that’s trickier.</p>
<p>“You don’t necessarily get more protections for what you say online than you do if you said it offline,” he said.</p>
<p>If it seems like our selfless hero Zulberti is starved for media attention, he is.  Or at least he’s willing to be.</p>
<p>“I am a believer that all publicity is good publicity,” he said. “I will die right here, no doubt about it, 100 percent certain…. I will do it for the headline: ‘Attorney Dies, Collapses in Front of the Supreme Court of the United States, Talking About Privacy Issues.’ Or I get the [press]. Either way, the message is out and I’ve won. Can’t lose.”</p>
<p>And no, getting an interview with the Washington Post isn’t enough for him.</p>
<p>“I want a major TV network,” he says.” I want 90 second spot on a major network during prime time. Yes, if you were from CNN and you said Anderson Cooper will air you tonight, I would pack up my signs and leave. Mission accomplished.”</p>

<p>A domestic disturbance call at an East Texas home includes a police report that a woman used a dead catfish to smack her sister-in-law in the face.</p>
<p>Lufkin police on Tuesday said nobody has been charged amid conflicting stories from a husband, his wife and his sister.</p>
<p>Sgt. Mike Shurley says no one was hurt in Sunday’s incident. Investigators are trying to determine what sparked the fight.</p>
<p>Officers were summoned after a woman allegedly used a fish to slap her sister-in-law in the face, the brother and sister argued and he asked his sibling to leave. Shurley says the sister called police to report being assaulted.</p>
<p>Shurley says the man was detained on an outstanding traffic warrant but was no longer in custody Tuesday. His name wasn’t immediately released.</p>

<p>When it comes to love, age is just a number, right?</p>
<p>According to 31-year-old Kyle Jones, everyone is wired differently. And while some of his peers prefer blondes or brunettes, the Augusta, Georgia, native’s penchant is for, ahem, mature women.</p>
<p>In fact, Jones has had plenty of pension-eligible paramours, but his current senior squeeze is 91-year-old great-grandmother Marjorie McCool. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omcxjXiWwpU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">above video</a>, McCool explains the perks of their May-December (or should we say March-December?) romance.</p>
<p>“It’s very flattering to have a younger guy chase you,” she notes, adding, “Sometimes I feel like he’s another son … until we hop into bed.”</p>
<p>McCool doesn’t go into detail about the pair’s sexual proclivities, but makes it clear she has no complaints. “The physical side of our relationship is wonderful,” she reveals. “I amaze myself. He amazes me. And I like it.”</p>
<p>For his part, Jones says he appreciates the facial lines that make many women self-conscious. “Women worry about their boobs sagging,” he adds. “I think the natural hang looks great. I’m really not a fan of plastic surgery. I don’t like to say ‘gray’; I’m a fan of platinum hair.”</p>
<p>But Jones and his nonagenarian sweetheart have no plans to become exclusive. He’s also wooing 68-year-old Anna Ronald, among other grandmothers (and great-grandmothers).</p>
<p>Though Jones has taken some ribbing from pals, at least his mom approves of his geriatric trysts.</p>
<p>“The older women are more mature,” she observes. “They’re [people] he can actually sit down and talk to. And he’s not hurting anybody, so I don’t really think that it’s really anybody’s business.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Southern California high school teacher is facing kidnapping charges after pulling a knife on a trio of students and demanding they drive him to a fast-food restaurant while he was apparently intoxicated, Los Angeles County sheriff’s officials said.</p>
<p>The students were driving at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday when they stopped to greet one of their teachers, 34-year-old John Edward Maust, whom they saw standing near Ganesha Avenue and East Mariposa Street in Altadena, sheriff’s officials said in a news release.</p>
<p>Maust asked for a ride, and the 17-year-olds agreed. But during the trip, the driver became worried by their conversation with the teacher and pulled the car over, officials said.</p>
<p>“They immediately noticed that he was intoxicated,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Deputy Tony Moore. “They didn’t feel safe. They got out of the car and he ordered them back into the car.”</p>
<p>The teacher at Arroyo Pacific Academy in Arcadia demanded the students drive to a Jack in the Box restaurant, according to the sheriff’s department. Maust pulled out a knife on the teens after they reluctantly re-entered the car, officials said.</p>
<p>One of the teens was able to call 911 during the drive. When Maust saw a sheriff’s department helicopter flying overhead, he bailed from the car and fled on foot, officials said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Maust surrendered at the Altadena Sheriff’s Station, where he was arrested without incident, officials said. He faces charges of kidnapping, false imprisonment, and criminal threats. He was being held on $100,000 bail. It was not immediately clear whether he had obtained an attorney.</p>
<p>The teacher was placed on indefinite administrative leave, according to school officials.</p>
<p>“We are immensely saddened,” said Philip Clarke, president of Arroyo Pacific Academy. "We are very concerned about the well being of a long-term, well-respected faculty member who is involved. Our hearts and our prayers go out to him at this moment of this situation in his life.</p>
<p>“Our primary concern is for the well being and welfare of our students.”</p>

Yuan Meixia, who lives in Fujian province in the country’s southeast, calls the bugs “my children, my babies”, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/weird-news/woman-keeps-100000-cockroaches-in-her-home-says-theyre-her-babies-9538286.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Independent reports.</a><br>
She has cemented every crevice in the rural home to prevent the insects from escaping and feeds them every day at 6pm by leaving out apples, bran and melons.<br>
Although she treats the animals as her own, she ends up drowning, drying and then selling them to a pharmaceutical company.<br>
The roaches are used in traditional Chines medicine and fetch up to $A130 per kilo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Hamilton man with a long history of public indecency convictions was arrested again for simulating sex with a pool float. Edwin Tobergta, 35, was arrested Wednesday morning after a witness observed him standing naked on Route 4 in Hamilton simulating sex with a pink pool floatation device. According to the police report, the witness said he was in full view of nearby businesses and passing cars. He was charged with public indecency and contempt of court. Tobergta was previously arrested in June of 2013 after he engaged in sex with a pool float outside of his house in front of several children. He pleaded guilty to that offense and was sentenced to 11 months in prison but was released early. In August of 2011 he was arrested for a similar offense involving having sex with a pink swimming pool raft. In 2002, he was caught having sex with an inflatable pumpkin that was part of a Halloween display.</p>

Then it’s the cries of the little girl.<br>
But what happens next, leaves the man angry and shocked.<br>
Just as the woman grabs the child and starts to drag her away, the little girl resists.<br>
Then suddenly the woman, believed to be the girl’s mum, lifts up her leg and kicks the girl so hard in the head she falls to the ground.<br>
Immediately, the man shooting the video yells something at the woman.<br>
She turns to look but does not respond and quickly grabs the child to leave.<br>
The incident is said to have occurred in March at Japan’s Shibuya Train Station but was posted to YouTube this week.</p>

Please. NC is trying to get the global warming report changed to not reflect predicted flooding in their area… which makes no fucking sense what so ever.</a></p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>NAGS HEAD, N.C. — The dangers of climate change were revealed to Willo Kelly in a government conference room in the summer of 2011. By the end of the century, state officials said, the ocean would be 39 inches higher and her home on the Outer Banks would be swamped.</p>
<p>The state had detailed maps to illustrate this claim and was developing a Web site where people could check by street address to see if their property was doomed. There was no talk of salvation, no plan to hold back the tide. The 39-inch forecast was “a death sentence,” Kelly said, “for ever trying to sell your house.”</p>
<p>So Kelly, a lobbyist for Realtors and home builders on the Outer Banks, resolved to prove the forecast wrong. And thus began one of the nation’s most notorious battles over climate change.</p>
<p>Coastal residents joined forces with climate skeptics to attack the science of global warming and persuade North Carolina’s Republican-controlled legislature to deep-six the 39-inch projection, which had been advanced under the outgoing Democratic governor. Now, the state is working on a new forecast that will look only 30 years out and therefore show the seas rising by no more than eight inches.</p>
<p>Environmentalists are appalled, and North Carolina has been lampooned as a hotbed of greedy developers trying to “outlaw” the rising tide. Some climate-change experts are sympathetic, however, calling the rebellion an understandable reaction to sea-level forecasts that are rapidly becoming both widely available and alarmingly precise.</p>
<p>"The main problem they have is fear,” said Michael Orbach, a marine policy professor at Duke University who has met with coastal leaders. “They realize this is going to have a huge impact on the coastal economy and coastal development interests. And, at this point, we don’t actually know what we’re going to do about it.”</p>
<p>Cities such as Norfolk and Miami have embraced the data, identifying inundation zones as a first step toward planning — and seeking federal funds for — sea walls, floodgates and other forms of protection. On lonelier stretches of the U.S. shoreline, however, government aid seems less likely than interference and abandonment, and the forecasts are sparking deep anxiety about the future.</p>
<p>In the Carolinas and Southampton, N.Y., isolated enclaves of ultra-rich shore-front owners have moved preemptively to build private bulkheads to protect their homes from the rising sea. But such fortifications are not an option on the Outer Banks, a string of narrow barrier islands dotted with busy beach towns, isolated fishing villages and stretches of wild seashore. In spots, the islands are barely 100 yards wide.</p>
<p>“We don’t have any tools in our toolbox other than retreat,” Kelly said on a recent morning in a sunny Manteo cafe that would be underwater if the sea were 39 inches higher. “In the backs of their minds, what everyone is thinking is that they just want people off the Outer Banks.”</p>
<p>Long before that would happen, though, Kelly worries that codifying the 39-inch forecast would crush the local economy, which relies entirely on tourism and the construction, sale and rental of family beach houses. In Dare County alone, the islands’ largest jurisdiction, the state has identified more than 8,500 structures, with an assessed value of nearly $1.4 billion, that would be inundated if the tides were 39 inches higher.</p>
<p>Even with an eight-inch forecast, 414 Dare County properties worth $70 million would be marked for inundation. If the state ever activates the Web site that lets potential investors search by address, Kelly said, “all of a sudden, those properties would be worthless.”</p>
<p>Nationwide, $700 billion of coastal property could be below mean sea level by the end of the century — and an additional $730 billion could be at risk at high tide — without new policies to forestall climate change, according to a new report by the Risky Business Project, a high-powered group of financial and political figures who are set to meet Wednesday with senior Obama administration officials.</p>
<p>So far, locals say there is no sign that the housing market on the Outer Banks is suffering. Nags Head’s town manager, Cliff Ogburn, said that the town is doing a booming business in building permits and that “occupancy is as high as it’s ever been,” having rebounded from the dark days before 2011. That is when Nags Head and Dare County spent $36 million to repair severe erosion on 10 miles of beachfront, where encroaching waves had claimed nearly a dozen houses and the seaside swimming pool at the Nags Head Comfort Inn.</p>
<p>Now the beach looks great, the tourists are back and Duck, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills are talking to the county about beach nourishment projects of their own.</p>
<p>“We lose beach because the water is rising equal to the thickness of two nickels every year,” Bobby Outten, the manager of Dare County, said on a recent tour of the restored shoreline. “Some call it sea-level rise, but from our perspective it’s erosion, and we’ve been living with it forever.”</p>
<p>The arrival of man-made beaches on the Outer Banks has drawn the disapproval of some environmentalists. For generations, the islands have moved with the waves and human settlements have moved with them. These days, however, the islands are so heavily developed, houses threatened by the surf often have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Beach nourishment offers a temporary solution. But as the sea rises, it “ceases to be cost effective and it becomes obvious that something else has to happen,” said Spencer Rogers, an erosion specialist with North Carolina Sea Grant, a research consortium based at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>“If things get to the worst extent, then we’re going to be abandoning places,” Rogers said. “There won’t be any option.”</p>
<p>Outten acknowledges that nourishment is a temporary fix, but he argues that it protects property, beautifies the shoreline and keeps the local economy humming. Besides, he said, it’s the only option he’s got.</p>
<p>“What is it you would ask us to do differently right now? Tell people to move away?” Outten said. “Preaching abandonment is absurd. People would go in the closet and get the guns out.”</p>
<p>That’s nearly what happened when local officials caught wind of the 39-inch forecast. The North Carolina Coastal Resources Commission, which regulates land use in the state’s 20 coastal counties, had asked its science panel to assess vulnerability to sea-level rise, which was then becoming a hot topic nationally.</p>
<p>In 2010, the panel reviewed the scientific literature and concluded that the seas along the North Carolina coast could rise anywhere from 15 inches to 55 inches over the coming century, a forecast in line with projections by federal agencies and various other states.</p>
<p>But the science panel took a step further. For planning purposes, it said, the state should figure on 39 inches by 2100. So the commission drafted a policy declaring sea-level rise “a pervasive and persistent hazard” and ordering coastal counties to use the 39-inch forecast for private development and public infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>If adopted, the policy would have made North Carolina the first state to issue such a precise forecast for sea-level rise, said Skip Stiles, who tracks state activity on climate change for Virginia-based Wetlands Watch. Bob Emory, the Coastal Resources Commission’s chairman at the time, said its members “had no idea we were opening up a can of worms.”</p>
<p>The worms hit the fan in January 2011, when the commission rolled out the policy in a closed-door briefing for Carteret County.</p>
<p>“They said there were numerous things the county had to start doing: Raise roads, elevate bridges, rezone land. Any property affected by 39 inches, they wanted to be rezoned as uninhabitable,” said John Droz, a local physicist who was quickly recruited by Carteret County officials to undertake an independent review of the 39-inch forecast.</p>
<p>Emory disputed that account, saying the commission had no intention of demanding such drastic action. “We were not at the stage where there was enough certainty to say you can do this here, you can’t do that there,” he said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Carteret County chairman fired off a letter asking neighboring counties for help “repudiating the proposal.” The science was uncertain, he wrote, there was no assessment of economic impact and there were no maps to show what it all meant.</p>
<p>By July, when Kelly walked into that meeting of federal and state planning officials, the state had maps. And the news was not good.</p>
<p>At 39 inches, the backside of the Outer Banks was gone. So was most of Roanoke Island. Inland, it was worse. On the gentle slope of the piedmont, every foot of sea-level rise would inundate roughly 1,000 acres. Pamlico Sound would look more like the Chesapeake Bay — one of the most profound transformations of coastline predicted anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Rumors spread, and members of the state’s environmental community fanned the flames, musing publicly about an end to new construction on the Outer Banks and the possible abandonment of Highway 12, the islands’ wave-battered, much-repaired lifeline.</p>
<p>A member of the science panel, geologist Stanley Riggs, published a book likening the islands to a “string of pearls” that would soon be separated by shoals unable to support a fixed highway. In Dare County, this spawned dark jokes about getting to work by kayak.</p>
<p>In 2012, the General Assembly agreed that the state was moving too fast. Lawmakers set aside the 39-inch forecast and ordered the commission to draft new projections that take into account dissenting views on sea-level rise and its causes.</p>
<p>The state’s new Republican governor appointed a new coastal commission chairman, Frank Gorham, an oil and gas man who announced this spring that the new forecast would be limited to 30 years.</p>
<p>With the 100-year forecast, “we just lost credibility,” Gorham said. “If you have a 30-year period, people will take it more seriously.”</p>
<p>Rogers, who has served on the commission’s science panel since its inception, predicts that the new forecast will look pretty much like the old one, which concluded that the sea would rise at roughly historic rates through 2050. Only in the latter half of the century is sea-level rise projected to accelerate sharply. But that lies outside the scope of the new forecast, which is due out next year.</p>
<p>With their bureaucratic victory, coastal leaders are postponing the inevitable, environmentalists say.</p>
<p>“I can see their point. They’re saying, ‘How do we know the sea is going to rise 39 inches in 100 years?’ And the truth is, we don’t. But you’ve got to start planning for something,” said Andrew Coburn, associate director of Western Carolina University’s Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines. “They’re trying to ignore the problem, hoping it will go away.”</p>
<p>Outten, the Dare County manager, says he is not ignoring the forecast, though he does pray it’s wrong.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he said, “it doesn’t seem reasonable to invest today’s tax dollars and punish the public for a problem that is 100 years away and may not exist. We aren’t arguing with science. We’re just trying to be reasonable.”</p>
