<p>Leave it to idiots to give you some form of entertainment. This is too ridiculous to not laugh at.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Feminist mobs an airport because men’s bathrooms all over the airport has a shorter line to it…</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The official Twitter account for Switzerland’s Zurich Airport replied Friday morning to a woman complaining about lengthy wait times at women’s restrooms by suggesting she take her grievances up with Mother Nature.</strong></p>
<p>A Twitter user going by the name Laura Roldan posted two photographs showing long lines at the bathrooms in the terminal. When, she asked in an accompanying caption, was “the airport going to solve the problem with the ladies toilets?”</p>
<p>Zurich suggested Roldan try one of the “many toilets all over the gate.” When Roldan continued to press her case, the airport delivered a more blunt response:</p>
<p>The airport’s response sparked a flurry of rebukes from feminists on Twitter, who jumped in to defend Roldan and chastise Zurich.</p>
<p><img src="https://p0-ia.powr-media.com/?url=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/powr-content/p0/domains/3e26ac7f/1f8a/4b0f/a219/f41fc948347f/logo.jpg&amp;w=40&amp;h=40" alt="" width="" height=""><a href="https://powr.com/video/mHVDK1Lu55" rel="nofollow noopener">AOC - US Is Running Concentration Camps At The Border</a></p>
<p>“If there was ‘enough space’ there wouldn’t be queues, how is that not obvious? There is enough space for men, there is not enough space for women,” <a href="https://twitter.com/tkingdot/status/1142034497556418560?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> columnist Tracy King.</p>
<p>“Women need 2.5 x the provision that men need,” wrote Clare James, a British high school math teacher.</p>
<p>BBC World Service broadcaster Jackie Leonard was appalled.</p>
<p>“Clearly not. Wow. What a response!” she <a href="https://twitter.com/JackieLeonard01/status/1142083201512464385?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>.</p>

<p>“Of course you can influence it by providing correct number of toilets based on the needs of each sex. Had never thought about male privilege extending to almost never queuing for a piss but here we are in 21c with men’s time &amp; comfort more valued than women’s,” one commenter <a href="https://twitter.com/Natwood18/status/1142036562265411584?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>The airport answered the avalanche of criticism by apologizing and conceding that the issue “urgently requires action.”</p>
<p>“This is a problem which exists in all public areas and which urgently requires action. We have informed the department responsible for building planning. We would like to sincerely apologize to all women who had to wait in front of one of our toilets. We hear your problem,” Zurich <a href="https://twitter.com/zrh_airport/status/1142045281791434755?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> in a tweeted reply to a user.</p>
<h3>Zurich airport and “Invisible Women”</h3>
<p>Several critics, including Roldan, referenced “Invisible Women,” a book by British feminist activist and author Caroline Criado Perez.</p>
<p>In it, Criado Perez compiled a plethora of statistics intended to prove her thesis: despite the appearance of progress on the women’s rights front, modern society is still very much a “man’s world” because “those who built it didn’t take gender differences into account.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/28/invisible-women-by-caroline-criado-perez-review" rel="nofollow noopener">review</a> for The Guardian published in February, English cultural critic Eliane Glaser prasied “Invisible Women” for using data to shed light on “the hidden places where inequality still resides.”</p>
<p>Loading…</p>
<p>Offices are on average five degrees too cold for women because the formula to determine their temperature was developed “based on the metabolic resting rate of a 40-year-old” man. Smartphones, at an average size of 5.5 inches, are “too big for most women’s hands” and don’t fit in their pockets. Virtual reality headsets are more likely to make women feel sick.</p>
<p>“Even snow-ploughing, it turns out, is a feminist issue,” Glaser said of Perez’s book, referencing a study that showed how in one Swedish town, 70 percent of pedestrians injured in icy conditions are women.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, critics of feminism argue that the movement focuses too much energy on policing microaggressions and perceived slights. They accuse feminists of being <a href="https://pluralist.com/botanical-sexism-seasonal-allergies/" rel="nofollow noopener">out of touch</a> with the concerns of the broader culture.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.startribune.com/mankato-professor-taking-heat-for-tweet-that-god-is-guilty-of-metoo-violation/502224661/" rel="nofollow noopener">My head hurts…</a></p>
<p>TL;DR: In a case of insanity a Minnesota State University professor thinks god raped the virgin mary. Wat? And yes, it exists. Much to my chagrin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A psychology professor at Minnesota State University, Mankato is taking heat from conservative TV talk show host Tucker Carlson for tweeting that God is guilty of a <span class="hashtag">#MeToo</span> violation for the Virgin Mary’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Eric Sprankle, who specializes in sexuality studies, angered Carlson and guest commentator Mark Steyn Thursday on Carlson’s Fox News show with his tweet from earlier in the week: “The virgin birth story is about an all-knowing, all-powerful deity impregnating a human teen. There is no definition of consent that would include that scenario. Happy Holidays.”</p>
<p>In response to a critical tweet, Sprankle responded with a tweet saying that “the biblical god regularly punished disobedience. The power difference (deity vs mortal) and the potential for violence for saying ‘no’ negates her ‘yes.’ To put someone in this position is an unethical abuse of power at best and grossly predatory at worst.”</p>
<p>On Carlson’s show. Steyn expressed his displeasure with what Sprankle wrote.</p>
<p>“Fifty years ago, this kind of shallow banality would be something in the province of a drunk undergraduate at three in the morning,” he said.</p>
<p>Sprankle didn’t return e-mails or telephone calls Friday seeking comment. The university issued the following statement:</p>
<p>“As a public institution of higher education, Minnesota State University, Mankato respects the rights and privileges associated with the U.S. Constitution, including in this case the First Amendment right of freedom of speech and religion.”</p>
<p>A spokesman said the university wasn’t aware of parents or donors who may have contacted the school about Sprankle’s tweets. He added that the school had received a handful of complaints.</p>
<p>In addition to being a college professor, Sprankle also is a licensed psychologist and certified sex therapist. He leads the university’s Sexual Health Research Team, which examines sex work stigma, the effects of sexually explicit material and older adult sexuality.</p>
<p>On his Twitter bio, he said he reads Edgar Allan Poe and advocates for sex workers’ rights. The bio also includes the words “Ave Satanas,” Latin for “Hail Satan.”</p>
<p>Sprankle has nearly 17,000 followers on Twitter. A few posted critical tweets this week: “This idiot clearly is an atheist! Has no clue of scripture. Just spewing hate &amp; lies!” said one. Another read, “Eric Sprankle the professor who thinks God is a sex predator? We should not want to see anyone go to hell and we all only have a limited time in this world. So with any luck God will work on him and lead him to Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Sprankle’s tweet was discussed only briefly on Carlson’s show, but Steyn got his point across.</p>
<p>“The idea that God has got the Virgin Mary back to his pad, and she’s saying ‘I really must go,’ and he’s saying ‘Baby, it’s cold outside’ … I miss the days when atheists were at least intelligent enough to take seriously what they were purporting to knock down,” he said.</p>

            <p>Actually knew someone who worked in that area at NASA in Houston.  He told me that if I came down that he could get me on the Space Shuttle simulator! About three years later I was heading to Houston and called him up. Guess what? He was in California  on a NASA assignment!<br>

            <p>Also on USAJOBS they tend to put up postings just because they’re legally required to do so before filling the position, even if they have someone already in mind within the agency.</p>
<p>The things they’re asking for on that listing are very unlikely to be from someone not already in NASA – who on earth has experience at GS-15 that needs to hear about this job through fucking newsweek</p>

<p>That is something I considered after I stopped laughing. Funny, yes, especially under the sense of pop-culture (hence why I posted it). In terms of a real-world problem, I can seriously see that, especially with NASA’s planned mission(s) to Mars and its budget being boosted significantly.</p>

            <p>Well, what’s laughable is how totally off the mark that news article is.</p>
<p>This is to do with making sure that we don’t bring biological contaminants, intentionally or otherwise, along with human or robotic missions to other planets that could threaten or affect the natural evolution of potential existing life on those planets, and vice versa, making sure that potential biological contaminants or samples brought back from human or robotic missions to other planets don’t threaten life on earth.</p>

<p>Want to save planet Earth? You could apply for NASA’s Planetary Protection Officer role.</p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is currently looking for someone with a secret security clearance to ensure alien life, or “organic-constituent and biological contamination” doesn’t make it’s way back in a space ship.</p>
<p>More than that, this person is “responsible for the leadership of NASA’s planetary protection capability, maintenance of planetary protection policies, and oversight of their implementation by NASAs space flight missions,” <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/474414000#btn-add-info" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">according to the job listing</a>.</p>
<p>Candidates must have “advanced knowledge of Planetary Protection,” experience overseeing nationally significant space programs and have demonstrated “skills in diplomacy that resulted in win-win solutions during extremely difficult and complex multilateral discussion.” After all, protecting the planet is sure to present challenges.</p>
<p>Requirements include frequent travel. Could business trips include intergalactic travel? <span class="bbcode-i"><a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/movies/meninblack3/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Men in Black</a></span>, is that you?</p>
<p>That’s a lot of responsibility for one person, which is why the job comes with a six-figure pay: $124,406 to $187,000 annually.</p>
<p>Thanks for keeping us safe, NASA.</p>

<p>TL;DR: NASA’s hiring someone to oversee planetary defense against various threats, including, but not limited to alien invasion.</p>
<p>No, it isn’t a joke. It actually <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/474414000#btn-add-info" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">exists</a>.</p>
