I think you can expect BMDM (consider that coined) to be a bit more polished than the auto-magic conversion that HLDM: Source basically was, lol.
Paul (lead programmer) and myself both worked on HL2CTF back in it&#39;s heyday. It gave us a lot of experience with creating a polished multiplayer experience, learning about serious and casual players and what they want, communicating and iterating with our community, and designing fun gameplay.

I think you can expect a multiplayer experience that is both true to the original and takes all of those things into account, and more. BMDM is not just a sidenote to the singleplayer...we take it very seriously and will use everything we love and we&#39;ve learned to make it the best experience we can.

If that doesn&#39;t fill you with confidence, I don&#39;t know what will. I found HL2CTF vastly superior to HL2DM on many levels - just lacking a broader community of players.</description>

            <p>So… Are there any changes coming to Black Mesa Deathmatch regarding gameplay (compared to original Half-life1)?</p>
<p>I mean things like movement, weapon-functions, balancement… etc.<br>
I heard some things will be changed… for example the RPG (hl2-style) and the Crossbow (no insta-hit in zoom mode)… Is that true? If yes, is it possible to add a command which lets you play with original hl1 weapons (same weapon properties than original hl1).</p>
<p>Sure… HL1DM bow was not realistic… but… it was very good for the balancing and also fun to play. I also found the HL2 RPG too easy to use. You were nearly uable to not hit your target…</p>

<p>ye ok. i didn’t know that dm_zeta is no killbox/dev-map, because i don’t play HL2DM anymore. It pissed me off… Fact is, too many unfinalized maps go public. Maps should be tested on password protected servers until they get finally released and uploaded on public-servers.</p>

<p>If you actually think half-life 2 deathmatch has well designed maps… Why are there so many HL2DM servers running with maps like “dm_domebox_tsgk”, “dm_zeta_prefinal” or “dm_killbox_tsgk_v8_rc3”??<br>
IMO it’t obvious that HL2DM maps are just not on a high quality standard.</p>

<p>Will you add the possibility to perform this trick in BMS crossfire?</p>
<p>Further, I would suggest to invite some top half-life 1 players to test BMDM. So you get feedback from experienced HLDM players.<br>
There are still good players left playing half-life in ESL (Electronic Sports League) and EHLL (Elite Half-Life League).<br>
You really should contact “Worldspawn” on IRC (Server: Quakenet Channel: <span class="hashtag">#ehll</span>) or contact him over steam. You find him as an Admin in the steamgroup “Elite Half-Lilfe League (EHLL)” (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/EHLL" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamcommunity.com/groups/EHLL</a>).<br>
He also is the administrator of the International Half-Life ESL tournament.<br>
Talk with him. I’m sure he will organize a team of top HLDM players, which will help you making BMDM a game, which keeps being interessting for a long time (through their testings, experience, feedback and advice).<br>
I can only recommend it to you.<br>
If you make everything right, you could make the HL1DM community move to BMDM and that would be great. ((:</p>

<p>That said, I enjoy HL2DM just as much.  Gravgun fights are chaotic, xbow prediction, nade cooking and orb pong… all good stuff.  Oh and killbox maps are a riot to play, period; finished “maps” or not. :freeman:</p>

dm_lostvillage was also a good HLDM remake for HL2DM though the level was originally designed for the TAU.</p>

            <p>God those maps enrage me.</p>
<p>Killboxes / Dev maps [COLOR=‘Red’]ARE NOT FINISHED MAPS!!![/SIZE]</p>
<p>Too many times have I been playing on a CS: Source server, having a blast, only for it to switch to a God damned killbox map. I’m sure the same thing happens in HL2DM but I’m not sure because I don’t play it. HL2DM sucks balls.</p>
<p>Also, “BMDM” when read as a word sounds like “Bummed 'em.” which makes me giggle. :retard:</p>

</aside>
<p>I know these… But there was a huge difference in using these weapons… In HL2DM they are not very helpful, because they have a huge delay… You throw SLAMS and then you have to wait a long time until you get the radio in your hand, so that you can light your SLAMS…<br>
In HL 1 you were able to light your Stachels while they were in air… So you were able to use them in a fight. In HL2DM they are only helpful for camping because of the huge delay.<br>
You can moreover plant tripmines instantly in HL1. There was no delay also. When you try to plant SLAMS in HL2DM… You have to wait seconds standing at the wall before you were able to plant your mines… Because of that you mostly get shot while trying to plant…</p>

</aside>
<p>If you actually think half-life 2 deathmatch has well designed maps… Why are there so many HL2DM servers running with maps like “dm_domebox_tsgk”, “dm_zeta_prefinal” or “dm_killbox_tsgk_v8_rc3”??<br>
IMO it’t obvious that HL2DM maps are just not on a high quality standard. Maps like Overwatch and Lockdown are maps from HL2SP, which have been changed a bit to fit into a deathmatch game… Remember… HL2 was supposed to be a Singleplayer game… Valve thought it would be enaugh to have Counter-Strike Source as HL2’s multiplayer part… So… They did not care much about HL2DM… In HL1 the multiplayer mode was always part of the game… It was planned from the beginning and it was thought out.</p>

</aside>
<p>So… Why are there still so many clans in HL which play this “shitty unbalanced” game? Maybe think about that it’s possible that HL1 simply has a better learning curve than HL2??</p>
<p>“lack of retarded exploits,”</p>
<p>I never said that… Why do you think HL1 movement is full of “retarded exploids”?! Half-Life 1’s movement has great featues… You have air-control and can gain great speed like in Quake… and you know Quake is a VERY popular multiplayer game… So… IMO “unrealistic” … in your opinion “retarded” movement tricks where part of the game… It was a feature and it made the game stayin popular and competitive, because these “exploids” add depth to the gameplay…</p>

<p>I’ve never played HL2 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> M but it seems to be a lot like HL:S, a low-budget game port from one form to another (in this case, from a singleplayer game to a multiplayer deathmatch).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>exactly my opinion… they did not even thought about balancement… wtf is everybody SPAWNING with grav gun?! IMO the grav gun is one of the most powerful weapons in the game… they should have made it as a pick up weapon. …and btw… i own hl1, hl2:dm and hl :s  dm… so… hl1dm 4tw.</p>
<p>i am a hl1 gamer with passion… i only play deathmatch… and there are many tricks to flee or to wg people… when i look at the screenshots i cant see anything left of these tricks… in my opinion black mesa source will end like counter-strike: source. gameplay will be changed and all the hardcore gamers will be disappointed… some guy on the forums said “we take it very serious” (deathmatch mode) … so… i don’t believe that, because the main aspect of half-life:deathmatch is finding good routes, using tricks and dominating the map by stealing all weapons before the other can get one. (Simple 1on1 match tactics.)<br>
The black mesa maps are WAY DIFFERENT in comparasion to the maps on which they are based. so… I don’t see much future for bmdm… all the long-time hl players will stay at “half-life:adrenaline gamer mod” playing leagues and having a nice community… nobody will stick to bmdm, if the maps and the movement weren’t build like the originals… on the screenshots i see, that many gameplay oriented places have been dramatically changed. Some would LOOK GOOD also, if they were the same like in HL… It seems that you are developing a game that should be as realistic as possible… and imo HL in general is no realistic game… So why make everything realistic when you could have it a bit unrealistic, but more fun? (like it was in HL1)</p>
<p>but… i think i can write texts and texts… bmdm will end like cs :s … hl1dm player base will be dissappointed and new players will come to bmdm… this or that… bmdm will be popular… but just not a half-life remake… it will be a new game.</p>

<p>Snarks, maps, and the v_shotgun perspective. Otherwise it’s the same.</p>
<p>I almost prefer HL2DM because it lacks those tau-cannon&amp;wallhacking players. But I favor HLDM because of lower system requirements, more indoor maps, and more custom models available.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Both games play very different hence the map types based on particular weapons.<br>
The xbow is a very different weapon between the two.</p>
<p>The Tau was always a weapon of skill, a lot of new players at the time considered the advanced tau techniques hacking though the gluon balanced it out for newer players.</p>
<p>The shot gun was also more deadly at close range and the speed a game of hl1dm was played at was significantly different to the physics based lag of a game HL2DM is.</p>
