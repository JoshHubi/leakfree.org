            <p>Rescue it? You made the first post saying how Gameinformer predicted that Half Life 3 is going to come out in 2011, and the thread instantly derailed into 7 pages of posts about whether the next Half Life will be called Half Life 3 or Half Life 2: Episode 3. It’s beyond rescue man.</p>

<p>That sounds like the best idea to me. As he’s also said, “believe what you play, not what you read.”</p>
<p>…however he immediately goes on to say, “The waters are murky, unfortunately, when it comes to the Gearbox titles because we did not make them and i don’t feel compelled to abide by every story idea they came up with to make their game more fun.”</p>
<p>So, yeah. Ugh. Would have been great if Op4 and BS were either not made or just accepted as canon. Then we wouldn’t get into these debates and weird “it is until it isn’t” situations.</p>

            <p>You “not canon” fags really piss me off sometimes.</p>
<p>“i am going to swear off contributing to this bizarre argument<br>
about canonical versus noncanonical works. If we can make good<br>
entertaining use of the elements of opfor in future games, then we may<br>
well do that, and at that time i guess folks will have a better idea of<br>
where we stand on all this. We can’t speak about story ideas outside of<br>
the games themselves–it’s meaningless. The games must stand on their<br>
own, contradictions and all. My only hope is to keep unreeling the<br>
story in such a way that it will continue to please the fans and spark<br>
interesting conversations.”- Marc Laidlaw</p>

<p>Really? Seems clear to me he meant Black Mesa was actually nuked. Either way, here’s another, more specific quote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?114535-Marc-Laidlaw-Vault" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“However, as to your last question, there was pressure on us to set half-life 2 at black mesa, which a lot of us felt would be creative death; it was important to break new ground. Nuking black mesa was a good way to ensure that we had a way to avoid setting half-life 2 there. You might say i gave the g-man his orders. The whole issue of canon is something the fans came up with. I guess you will be able to identify as canon those story elements we continue to build on and develop and mention repeatedly as the story progresses. Others might fall by the wayside once they’ve served their purpose.”</a></p>
<p>If that doesn’t satisfy you, well, you can write Marc Laidlaw yourself to ask him. In any case, Black Mesa is dead and gone one way or another and almost certainly won’t be returned to.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Once again, out of context. The link that you quoted to was grounded in a conversation about Opposing force and Blue Shift and their development and was completely devoid of any nuclear event in the canonical HL universe.</p>
<p>A part of the very same quote that you conveniently forgot to post:</p>
<p>“Gearbox did what was right for their games. Even though they had feedback and guidance from us, they didn’t always listen to it, and they steered by their own lights, etc., etc. I wasn’t very close to the creation of the expansion packs, and much more concerned with how to move the story forward and open up the universe; so i only take the games created by valve into consideration when i am working on the story…”</p>
<p>The whole “nuking” of Black Mesa is nothing more than a half-ass-joke excuse for making the setting of HL2 in C17 rather than going back to BM.</p>
<p>Regardless, there’s another thread for this debate.<br>
On topic: EP3, not HL3.</p>

It WILL be called Episode 3 because they have stated time and time again that it’s “the third part in an episodic trilogy.” It blows my mind that people cant comprehend this. Just because it’s taken so long to make doesn’t mean the game will be that much longer. You think DNF is gonna have 300 hours of playtime because it took  14 years to release?</p>

<p>It isn’t called anything because it doesn’t exist yet.<br>
It WILL be called Episode 3 because they have stated time and time again that it’s “the third part in an episodic trilogy.” It blows my mind that people cant comprehend this. Just because it’s taken so long to make doesn’t mean the game will be that much longer. You think DNF is gonna have 300 hours of playtime because it took  14 years to release?</p>

            <p>How would they continue the HL1 story arc anyway? Black Mesa was nuked and Nihilanth was killed off, where would they go from there?</p>
<p>well the answer is simple my friend…the nihilanth made vorts slaves and made them wear the bands around their wrists but…the nihilanth wears them too…so maybe he is a slave to an even more powerful deity and also it doesnt have to take place in black mesa. gordon could be sitting on the can taking a dump and suddenly get wisped away to xen for all i care as long as i get to kick alien ass</p>

            <p>It is called half life 3 because valve has probably made it too long to be called an episode so it is an actual game rather than a short episode you can finish in 2 hours. it’ll probably be the length of half life 2. yay! gordon freeman approves :freeman:</p>

<p>C’mon am I the only one who thinks upon its release, HL Deathmatch was the biggest load of crap. Other than the Gravity Gun there really wasn’t much incentive for me to play it.</p>
<p>I seriously was hoping that with the release of Ep2 (at least) we were going to get a much improved multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>And when I say coop, I don’t mean Gordon and Co. Perhaps x rebels in the far flung areas of europe that have their own agenda and missions and don’t come into contact with the main characters.</p>

            <p>This is just speculation on my part, but we never did find out what happened on the Borealis.  Do you think they, (VALVE), would do an episode on the Borealis, and at the end the G-man tucks you away with the “Half Life 3 Coming Soon” bit in there somewhere, or would they just explain what happened during the course of events in Half Life 3? I know nothing has been said, just being curious.</p>

I just expect big <span class="bbcode-b">BIG[/SIZE]</span> Surprises in that episode (new enemies, weapons, models, new allies, maps, new engine, etc)</p>

<p>Why?Why? It’s not like there’s some kind of law stating that the longer it takes a game to release, the longer the game has to be. If that were the case, I guess Duke Nukem Forever would have be over 100 hours long. :retard:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>With all due respect, you have to consider every decision valve makes as a business decision, after all they are a company. It’s been a long time, and even though you’re a die hard fan who will buy the game no matter what, other people might need to be persuaded more. All things considering a 3-4 year wait for 6 hours of game play is kind of lame in most peoples eyes. It’s perfectly plausible to suggest that Vavles next Half-Life title, regardless of it’s name, will consist of a lot more than Episode 3 would have been. I don’t know if that means new mechanics or more hours of game play, but valve will do something to make their product stand out.</p>
