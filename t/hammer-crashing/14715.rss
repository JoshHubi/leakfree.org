    <description>Does hammer crash a lot for you people too? Like when using CTRL + Z, duplicating entities, naming things, selecting models for props..

Hammer is the tool that made me love CTRL + S so much that I use it all the time, for every program.</description>

<p>I would say I have modeling experience.<br>
Still. Hammer is TIMES better than UE4 when it comes to blocking out a level. It´s the reason why HammUEr exists.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, Hammer gives people like me - who have absolutely no experience in modelling, and doesn’t have the time or initiative to learn - a chance to create maps that we can be proud of.</p>

            <p>I should probably take the time to mention that BSP is mostly designed to work best with enclosed, indoor spaces that are generally cube-shaped (which makes sense, since most of the games back then were like that). Outdoor areas have a high tendency to defeat the whole point of the BSP geometry system, especially when coupled with PVS. This is why Episode 2’s outdoor areas were predominantly enclosed box canyons-- they’re outdoor, but also enough like the old boxy rooms that BSP still works decently.</p>
<p>Now that modern games have been moving more toward outdoor and open areas, BSP is a lot less relevant (from a visibility standpoint, at least).</p>

            <p>We totally are, which I think it’s safe to say is due to my background with Goldsrc. You’re not the only one I’ve argued with about this sort of thing - one of my roommates and I had a disagreement about whether or not level editors should even have geometry tools. I can definitely see the application of mesh-based stuff for props and details, but the way BSP tools are structured is just much more intuitive for me in terms of making the low-level architecture.<br>
There are ways to turn BSP into meshes, but they generally use a compiled map, and, in Source at least, the compile tools tend to create splits in the geometry based on gridlines which makes the resulting mesh hard to work with.</p>
<p>We need a VMF-to-OBJ converter that can strip out unneeded faces the way the compile tools do, but without the chops.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>You can also just use a free Version Control System that uses a local architecture. That is, one that doesn’t require an online repository to function (and stores all its files locally). That way, you genuinely don’t have to pay anything (though this comes at the cost of not having an external backup if your drive fails).</p>
<p>For instance, Git or Mercurial. Both of those don’t require an external repository (though you can use one if you want), which means you don’t have to pay someone to host your versioned files for you in order to use them. Plus both Git and Mercurial are free (and open-source).</p>

            <p>^ That<br>
There’s cheap ones, and some that are free for small amounts of storage (and VMFs aren’t typically large). DKY’s debated me this before, but personally I feel like if you’re not using a form of version control for your project, you probably don’t really care about your project.</p>

<p>I used to have the Flag tab crash all the time, but it hasn’t happened in months.  The Model Browser “crash” still sucks.  I’ve never heard of clicking in a 2D view and retrying to fix it.  Worth a shot the next time it happens.</p>
<p>I don’t have many problems with outright crashes.  I did notice that Bravado blew a gasket at some point on my old PC where every Object Properties seemed like it had to update and redraw itself for a second every time I clicked on something else.  Brought production to a crawl.</p>

<p>My god I really hate that bug. I really hate that one so mcuh.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I open properties of an entity or brush, it opens up half way and the screen freeze. But the annoying part is that hammer is still interactable - you can move around but cant do anything because the properties tab is keep opening. Oh god…</p>
<p>I like how this little thread started out as a smalll question and grew up quickly about ranting about Hammer. We needed this kind of thread anyway to ease our anger and pain of Hammer…</p>

            <p>Fun Fact: Hammer VMF file has a “mapversion” parameter that logs everytime how many times you save your map file.</p>
<p>I have saved 4000 times on one of my map according to the parameter. <span class="bbcode-s">I should work harder.</span></p>
<p>On topic, yeah, always save. Hammer crashing - it means it’s working as intended. Sometimes I save and it crash, but then I wanna undo the action I’ve done. But still most of time it’s much better to save and then worry about the consequences, not the other way around.</p>

            <p>On smaller maps I mash it idly constantly, whether I’ve made changes or not.</p>
<p>Once maps are large or complex enough that saving actually takes time, I tend to give it a couple minutes so I don’t spend more time saving than working.</p>

<p>Ctrl+S every <span class="bbcode-i">minute</span>? Are you kidding? You should be hitting Ctrl+S <span class="bbcode-i">every time you make a single edit</span>.</p>
<p>That also applies to every other application that’s based around load-save file edits, not just Hammer. You really should just save all your open files every time you so much as even <span class="bbcode-i">briefly pause</span>. It makes life so much easier. Gone are the days when hard drives were terrible and excruciatingly slow, so you really shouldn’t be afraid of doing that for literally everything you do.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well I was going to say every 10 seconds (or whenever I make a change), which is what I normally do, but I figured people might go and argue about how ridiculous that is. It seems no one else thinks it’s ridiculous so the truth is out haha</p>

<p>If you somehow manage to wear out an SSD due to spamming Ctrl+S in Hammer, you have a terrible SSD. Either that, or your fingers would be destroyed because you have just spent the past week spamming Ctrl+S at inhuman speeds without any breaks for food, drink, or sleep.</p>

<p>I can already hear it. Somewhere, in an NYC office building, an eerie buzzing emanates from an open window.<br>
This buzzing, when slowed down to 0.005x speed digitally, becomes a fast, audible keypress.<br>
The door to the office is locked. Nobody enters, nobody leaves. Rumors fly around the building about the soul trapped in Office 21-B, eternally saving Hammer. Nobody knows what the level is, but some speculate that it’s a single map from Ricochet 2.</p>

<p>Not true with modern ssds.  You’ll wear out a thousand keyboards before an ssd would fail.<br>
Sounds like Hammer is fickle.</p>
