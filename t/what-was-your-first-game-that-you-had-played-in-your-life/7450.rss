            <p>Uplink!</p>
<p>I remember loving this game but getting fustrated when I got cought and had to start all over (it saves your current status but you cant load to a previous point, i.e. only loads when you start up the game to your last point) because I didnt have enough time to clear the logs at x server.</p>
<p>Of course I only found out recently that I was doing it all wrong, you see if you use a server that you have easy access too as the first bounce link (like InterNC) then if you dont have time to clear the logs, disconect and go to this server and clear the bounding logs effectibly denying a trace to your ip.</p>
<p>Also the fact the latest patch introduces the future to save your bounced servers config, so you dont have to manually click tens of servers everytime you want to hack makes it incredibly less annoying.</p>
<p>So yeah actually getting somewhere in the storyline this time around and loving it!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>PS: It´s on steam for 10€ well worth it</p>

<p>Dangerous Dave and the Haunted Mansion for MS-DOS was cool.</p>
<p>You kids who started out playing Halo and Half Life as your first games don’t know what you were missing. A lot of my earliest games were first played on MS-DOS/Windows; Snake, Dangerous Dave and the Haunted Mansion, Chip’s Challenge, Ski Free, Stellar7, Prince of Persia, Wolfenstein 3D, and Chex Quest. Those were good times.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, that’s not the game I have in mind. It was more like a 2D platformer for PC. And if I remember correctly, the final boss was some kind of evil clone of the kid you’re playing as.</p>

            <p>Oh man, I’ve played so many different videogames when I was a kid. I can’t even tell which one was the first. I even recall watching my father playing videogames stored on some kind of cassette tape (Commodore 64 maybe?). But the ones I remember the most are Albion, Prehistorik (2?), some kind of brick breaker game, Doom 2, Jazz Jackrabbit and some game with a kid running around graveyards killing zombies and monsters with a slingshot. I completely forgot the name of that game.</p>
<p>Edit: But I must admit I rarely finished any videogame and when it was possible I played using cheats and walkthroughs. I think the first game I played all the way through and without cheating was Half-Life 2.</p>

            <p>I can’t, for the life of me, remember the name of this game, but it was an edutainment Sesame Street Alphabet game that had a merry-go-round with Cookie Monster picking out letters to form words. This game utilized the function keys to their fullest extent with an overlay that went over them that worked towards specific actions in the game.</p>
<p>That’s about all I remember, but it was the first game I played, and it was on an MS-DOS computer.</p>

            <p>Hide and Seek, i guess. haha.</p>
<p>There was a helicopter combat simulation, named somewhat like “Longbow”. But when my mother saw me shooting those 2d peeps (although the game was 3d), i wasnt allowed to play it again. (I think this was in 1996 when i was 6 years old)</p>

            <p>Hmmm… It was out of Doom and Quake for PC which led to Hexen and Duke3D then to Unreal and Half-Life.</p>
<p>For PS1 it was Spyro the Dragon 2: Gateway to Glimmer and Gran Turismo 2</p>
<p>…But I guess if you include the Sega Megadrive, the first ever game I played was out of Sonic the Hedgehog or Two Crude Dudes.</p>
