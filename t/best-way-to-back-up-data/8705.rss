    <title>Best Way to Back Up Data?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/best-way-to-back-up-data/8705</link>
    <description>I&#39;m shopping around for backing up my files on my computer.  What&#39;s the best option?  I&#39;ve heard some good things about Carbonite.  But I&#39;ve also heard that once you have a certain amount of files, things start to lag.  Of course, there are other cloud services I could try.  But having all of my files on someone&#39;s server kind of rubs me the wrong way.  And what about RAID?  It sounds too complicated with all the different  options and everything.  Or are there other alternatives?

Thanks  :wink:</description>
