<p>use chrome to download it, and make sure steam is installed before you install BM</p>

<p>Ok so i got it downloaded and installed and after the installer runs it will open and run the game, but now it doesnâ€™t show up in my steam Library.</p>
<p>I know this was the problem on W7 too, but i was able to fix that by retarting steam. Any ideas?</p>
