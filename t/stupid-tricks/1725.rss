    <description>I am subscribed to a rather funny gal on youtube, ([url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rma-ijjipWI&#39;]communitychannel[/url]) and her latest post asked the peanut gallery what silly stupid party tricks people can do.

I would post mine as a responce but I cant get a good shot with my camera, but basically I can do this...

            <p>I just remembered this today, well, it actually came up in the Bm steam chat.</p>
<p>But when I was in grade 1, for some reason, I decided I’d rather learn the alphabet backwards, then forwards, so to this day, I can it backwards and faster then I can forwards.</p>
<p>I dunno why, I just thought it was be fun I guess.</p>
<p>I can easily say it in under 5 seconds, less if I rush it, but I might mess it up.</p>

            <p>I can vibrate my eyes like the original video.</p>
<p>I can also make my left eyelid go into violent spasms. And my left upper lip too. Sometimes I can manage all three of these at once, though it looks like I’m having some kind of seizure or stroke or something.</p>
<p>I can whistle in and out, and roll my tongue, like many of you. I can move my eyebrows independently pretty well and pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I can bend my knees backwards to the extent that if I sit with my legs flat on the floor, I can lift my feet off the ground while thighs and knees are still on the ground.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’m a Traceur, so I can do a lot of stupid tricks. For instance, my ankles are abnormally strong… among other things, I can stand on them. I can also twist one ankle so far that my left foot points forwards (directly in front of me) and my right foot points directly behind me.</p>

<p>Crap, really?  I can’t even do half of one of those, and it’s been a goal of mine for ages.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The hardest part is balance. When I was first starting, I had to have my feet really wide apart, and I almost needed to have my upper body twisted at 90 degrees so I could push out to the side to lift myself up instead of pushing forward, but as I got stronger I was able to bring my feet closer together and bring my body more parallel with the ground, and let my arm handle more of the balance control.<br>
Also, if you still aren’t able to do one while your feet are set wide apart, you may simply need to build up your strength a bit more. Start with regular pushups and try to work up the number until you can do at LEAST 20 and try working towards 50. At this point you should be able to start raising your feet up higher, like putting your feet on a chair while your hands are still on the floor. This will put more of your body weight over your shoulders so you’re lifting more when doing pushups and help get you ready for when you attempt to do a full pushup with one hand.</p>
<p>And of course, remember to keep your back straight with one hand or regular pushups. You don’t want your butt or stomach sagging so that you’re only lifting your shoulders up.</p>

<p>Crap, really?  I can’t even do half of one of those, and it’s been a goal of mine for ages.</p>

            <p>1.) I can whistle in and out with no discernible difference in tonal quality<br>
2.) I can cross my eyes, then roll just one eye around in a circle, with either eye.<br>
3.) If I pull on my cheek a little bit and then breathe out through my mouth, I can make my cheek vibrate so it sounds like a horse snorting.<br>
4.) I can turn my entire face red and make the veins on my arms stand out just by tensing the muscles in my neck.<br>
5.) I can touch the tip of my nose with my tongue<br>
6.) I can hold my nose to readjust the pressure in my ears(not as cool as collision’s method, but it still works)<br>
7.) I can roll my tongue into a U or O shape, as well as flattening and thickening it. I thought everyone could do that, but apparently some people can’t.<br>
8.) I can unfasten a bra with one hand in about 1 - 3 seconds (front clasp bras take about 3-5 seconds)<br>
9.) I can manually compile Java and C++ programs (dunno what type of party that would be a trick for, but whatever)<br>
10.) I can spin a pencil around my fingers on either hand or both hands at the same time</p>
<p>I can KIND OF wiggle my nose and ears, but not much, and do one arm pushups, handstand pushups, and walk on my hands.</p>
<p>I can also totally imitate Gollum from Lord of the Rings.</p>

            <p>I bet that’s how you get all the sexy men eh?</p>
<p>My right thumb bends abnormally far back (and it hurts when I strum playing rock band), but that’s about it.</p>

            <p>I can move one of my eyes independently of the other. Reason is a trivial hereditary trait (thanks Mom), in which one of my eye muscles is too weak to stop the muscle on the other side from pulling. The upshot of this is that I can turn one eye inward while the other one stays in place, and it takes me no more effort than it does to move both eyes.</p>
<p>Makes crossing my eyes disgustingly easy. I have no idea how ‘normal’ people do it; I just simply displace my right eye, then look to the left.</p>

            <p>I once tried out for Continental Singers (christian chior going over seas) when I was a teenager and was tested at an 8 octave range.  Yeah… I cant do that anymore, but it was neet to find I could do it.  So Cookie, is that the same thing or are you talking about pre-puberty thingy?</p>
