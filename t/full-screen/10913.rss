        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have another issue, the game works fine when i put “-safe” in launch options, it loads it in a window. Now as soon as i try to run it fullscreen, my screen turns black with two lines flashing on the left side (i hear the intro music and the buttons click when i move the mouse). Not even ctrl + alt + del or anything works and i have to restart my computer in order to get it working again.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Yeah !</p>
<p>It is worked ! The real trick is, after you changed it to 16 : 9 you have to change the resolution too while in the same menu, in my case it was 1366 X 768 !</p>
<p>Now i can enjoy this super game in its “full” glory !</p>
<p>Thank you all !</p>

<p>This is my first source game, so i don’t know if others would work well.</p>
<p>The 16:9 aspect ratio likely would do the trick, i tried it earlier, but whenever i change it, the video option shows it accepted it, but when i go into the main menu, and back to the video option, it shows that it is still on 4 : 3 !? Looks like it is not want to accept it.</p>
<p>But i still have hope, i know someone will come here and will tell me the golden hint ^,^</p>

<p>Hi, I had the same problem.<br>
The -fullscreen option will not work, since the game is already launched in full screen, but the borders are cut of.<br>
So you have to go at the video menu of the game. There you will discover (as I did) that it is very stuborn in not accepting your settings. The only thing you can do is toggle the video resolution untill you can set the game into 16:9. It’s obviously a bug, but it worked on my laptop after some minutes trying and trying again…</p>

            <p>Works fine on my laptop, so it isn’t universal.<br>
Do other source games go full screen fine?</p>

            <p>you should try setting the aspect ratio to 16:9 under the in-game video options</p>

            <p>Hello There !</p>
<p>I have an Acer laptop, with basic resolution of 1366X768 and i can’t run this outstanding game in “full” fullscreen. The edges of the screen have black strips and they ruin a bit this great game.</p>
<p>I already tried to type -fullscreen in the Set Launch options and it did not worked. If someone would look into this problem and would work on it i think the countless Laptop users would be pleased.</p>
<p>Thank you, Black Mesa is fantastic !</p>

            <p>It should be in the video options. It’s standard for pretty much all Source games.</p>

            <p>Would this also work on a laptop? Because i tried inputting -fullscreen when the game launches, but that didn’t work (also did the same for Desura which is what I used to download BM). So Alt-Enter doesn’t work then what should I do next?</p>
