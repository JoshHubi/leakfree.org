This game looks like it would be so much more fun/cool with biblical battles and sea monsters trying to board the Ark. It simulates church, so that now even religious kids that aren&#39;t allowed to go online or play video games can become basement-dwellers.

 Awesome crucifix Wii-mote!

[i]Prie Dieux[/i] Wii Fit!


Note that it isn&#39;t actually listed as a real Wii game. Apparently the company making it was founded in Boston. If they have an office I may be able to find it.

So what do you think? Real, or a Hoax? 

And don&#39;t go on a violent bible-bashing tangent about your religious beliefs, because nobody gives a shit.</description>

<p>THAT is the Zoo race game. A religious racing game by Cougar interactive which has some of the most broken controls, piss poor gameplay, shitty graphics, annoying, atrocious sound design, etc. that I have EVER seen in any game ever made.</p>
<p>A friend dared me to download the demo and play it. When I played it, I was fucking speechless… The game is just… HORRIFYING. I frigging dare you to try that pathetic excuse of religious propaganda - you won’t last 5 minutes! XD</p>

            <p>Guys, we should stay on topic we already have a thread that is basically a religion debate.</p>
<p>We don’t need more people arguing the existence (or lack of existence) even though they can’t prove it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yeah sure, I don’t mind answering.</p>
<p>Well, my ‘proof,’ just like any other proof, is of course subjective to who it’s presented to. I don’t know that Muslim or Buddhist or Jew or Hindu, so I have no idea if they would accept it or not. As far as I can see in all logicality, they should, but I know that I’m only speaking from my point of view right now. But that, in and of itself, is why I believe it. If I was able to think that someone could reasonably disbelieve in the proof that convinced me, then I wouldn’t have any reason to believe it myself.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes in all certainty I would expect them (in their right mind) to accept that proof as I did, but alas if that were the case then we wouldn’t be having this discussion right now.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wasn’t saying you were flaming anyone, sorry if you took it that way, mate. And I agree with you about the whole congress / Noah thing. It’s totally wrong to misinterpret scripture to use against scientific evidence that we need to do something to save lives (although I will protest that even though it doesn’t say that the world would never end from disaster in that story of the Bible, I know the world won’t end before Jesus’ return. that’s not to say that I don’t think the world will end. And we still of course need to do the right things and not be careless about our environment and other things.)</p>
<p>I hope that addresses everything :]</p>

            <p>It is possible to have a rational discussion without it turning into a flame war.  I only posted due to sanatorium’s characterization which I didn’t/don’t think was justified.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that 77% of America claims to be Christian and there are people on the Congress Climate Change Panel that claim we don’t need to worry about global warming because the Christian god put the rainbow up after Noah’s ark and promised he’d never destroy everything again.  People try to push a non-scientific theory into science classes in various states across the country.  So it’s sometimes nice for people who don’t buy the Christian religion (or any religion) to not feel vastly outnumbered.</p>
<p>If you mind, I’d like to just ask you this: is any of the proof you’re speaking of something you could show a Muslim and that they would accept?  Or a Buddhist?  Or a Jew?  Or a Hindu?</p>

            <p>Thank you, Jonte.</p>
<p>And -sigh- to all the many atheists in this thread. I was going to post earlier but I thought “no, I better wait; a mod might come by and ban us for participating in a religion war.” I still don’t want to get into any sort of argument, but let me at least say this: I am NOT a Christian with a blind faith; I would NOT believe in this doctrine (or any doctrine) without a significant amount of proof (and yes we could argue all day about what is or isn’t “proof.” I’m just speaking from my opinion) to convince me. I’m sure you could argue that I am easily convinced of things, but that’s an entirely different discussion.</p>
<p>I’m only posting this because it seems in this thread Christian apologetics is a minority. I’m just trying to even things out a bit.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I try to be smart about what I believe, and I’m a Christian.</p>

            <p>We are all born athiest. Religious indoctrination of the young is little more than psychological child abuse. Therefore religious games for children are EVIL. Here endeth the lesson. Amen.</p>
<p>PS: I’m an athiest, by the way.</p>

<p>I am not a Christian nor am I religious at all.</p>
<p>Atheism isn’t smart.  We as a species have no fucking idea about life, where it came from, what it means, anything.  Anything can be out in the universe and to just denounce something from being possible with the extremely limited knowledge we have is not what I’d consider smart.</p>

<p>Cuz we’re so fucking awesome!<br>
Or we’re just tired to being oppressed by mainstream religion, and also tired of the United States being known as a “Christian nation.”<br>
Or we want people to know how “cool” we are by supporting what is unfortunately a “taboo” in today’s God fearing world. It’s like going Goth but not as freaky.</p>

<p>Being a Christian, I actually agree. It’s the same thing with Christian music (for the most part); they’re in it because there’s a large potential fan-base which means a large potential revenue turn-out.</p>
<p>If you require a video game to stimulate your religious needs, then you need to reconsider your faith.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">On a side note:</span> Why is it that it’s okay to poke a Christianity to death, but poking fun at Islam or other religions is foul play?<br>
Remember “Cartoon Wars part 2” from South Park? Trey and Matt did something brilliant with that episode. Towards the end, they had two scenes: One was simply the prophet Muhammad giving Peter Griffin <span class="bbcode-i">(they were making fun of Family Guy in that episode)</span> a football helmet, and the other depicts regular Americans, George W. Bush, and Jesus Christ shitting on each other. Comedy Central pulled the scene with Muhammad giving Peter the football helmet, but it’s apparently okay for them to show JESUS CHRIST SHITTING ON PEOPLE!</p>
<p>I’m not offended by the later scene, for I am an atheist. What I AM offended by is how it’s okay to make fun of one person’s beliefs, but not okay to make fun of another’s.</p>
<p>But, then again, the Middle East pretty much has us by the balls now. We need the oil and apparently it’s “impossible” to switch to better alternatives.</p>
<p>But now I’m getting off topic.</p>

I’m going to play this game.</p>
