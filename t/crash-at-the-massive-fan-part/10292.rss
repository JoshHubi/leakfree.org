    <title>Crash at the massive fan part</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-at-the-massive-fan-part/10292</link>
    <description>Hey. 
Just reporting that the game crashes at the massive fan part (not sure how to word it better, sorry). 
It can easily be avoided, but whenever I turn the fan on, if I drop a wooden crate or pallet onto the fan as it starts to spin, the game will crash every single time for me. 
Nothing too nasty. Just thought I&#39;d mention it here regardless.
I attached a couple of minidumps from that crash. Hope it helps!

Great job on that mod, by the way.

            <p>Scratch the part about throwing stuff into the fan. I thought it came from that because I was throwing stuff into it every time, but I just tried passing through that part without messing around with objects and I still crashed.<br>
I activate the switch under the fan, run for the ladder and get on top. After a few seconds as the fan starts speeding, my game crashes.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I just tried one more time and managed to pass that part without any crash. Weird…</p>

            <p>Hm, that’s odd. I can’t understand what’s going on there. I’m sure the developers appreciate the input though!</p>
