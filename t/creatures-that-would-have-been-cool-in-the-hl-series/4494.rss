    <title>Creatures that would have been cool in the HL series</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/creatures-that-would-have-been-cool-in-the-hl-series/4494</link>
    <description>Describe creatures that could have matched the Half-Life atmosphere (1 and 2 + Episodes) and could have been a good addition to the game&#39;s universe in your opinion. What would they look like, what would they behave like? These could even be creatures that were in one game and not the other, or entirely new ones.

These are obviously [u]not[/u] suggestions for Black Mesa!


For example, in HL2, I think it would have been interesting to have an enemy that would hide from you for a while, and try to attack you when you&#39;re not expecting it. It could creep you out knowing that you&#39;re not alone in the room, hearing it crawl around and knock things down from shelves, but you would have to hunt for it to kill it before it suddenly starts attacking you from behind. Basically it would not start attacking you right away, but rather lurk around like a cat for a while, and then suddenly jump at you. It could make some barely-audible noises, making you constantly paranoid about whether you heard something or if it was just your imagination, building up some suspense.

I thought of this because in every game, enemies always directly attack you: they see you, and they try to come closer and instantly attack you with whatever they have. In HL1, the houndeyes were the only things that came towards you then often ran away again. I heard that they were originally intended to be friendly creatures, which could explain their dog-like, non-aggressive, excited behaviour.</description>

            <p>Definitely the combine assassin from the concept art, I agree with the lurker/stalker enemy idea. Basically more sneaky enemies.</p>

<p>On topic: I’d want to see some kind of stealthy opponents in HL. The hunters were, well, too big, conspicuous and their joints squeaked. Something more like the assasins, only in an environment where they could blend in better, invisibility or no invisibility.</p>

            <p>there was a ‘‘cat’’ in the beta: the panthereye.</p>
<p>I would like to see a some kind of half dragon half tiger creature in hl, it would be like OH SHI… and start running and shooting while he was trying to hunt you with fire balls and attacking with it’s claws jumping on you and throwing your weapon away.</p>

            <p>Too bad now that means that the Gargantua is the new coakroach. OP: I think it would have been cool to have some dragon type creatures flying from island to island in Xen, similar to the Mantas but a bit more hostile.</p>

<p>I think the mods changed all/most cockroaches to a higher rank, because often cockroaches are treated like crap even if they’re smarter than the rest, only because they’re rank is cockroach.</p>

            <p>I would’ve loved to have seen the Hydra in HL2. I’m too lazy to look up the link right now, but in the Beta version, it was this little blue, kind of incandescent tentacle thing. It would attack and basically spear things on it’s sharp end.</p>
