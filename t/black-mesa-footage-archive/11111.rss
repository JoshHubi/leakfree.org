    <title>Black Mesa Footage Archive</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-footage-archive/11111</link>
    <description>[i]If you have any experience using source recorder, or just capturing footage within Source, then your help is needed!
[/i]

[b]The plan[/b]
All of you, the community, submit as much video footage from Black Mesa as possible, and everyone can use the footage to make some kickass trailers.

[b]What we need[/b]
We need flyover videos of the main set-pieces (dam, blast pit, lambda core, ect) and gameplay from all different chapters (combat mainly). For all gameplay please use &quot;cl_drawhud 0&quot; and try to record everything as high def as possible.
All footage should be from within the mod itself.

[b][i]Good luck, and get cracking![/i][/b]</description>
