    <title>Possible Achievement Bug(s)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/possible-achievement-bug-s/10335</link>
    <description>I do so love the feeling of gratification from accomplishing arbitrary goals that no-one else will know about but me, so I really appreciate the achievements, but I think I may have stumbled across some bugs (or I&#39;m just dumb--50/50 chance).

From the text, I assume the Caffeinated achievement meant you had to use 20 different vending machines, but I was able to get multiple points towards the goal per machine and accomplish it with just three machines.

Also, in Questionable Ethics, I think I did all 5 experiments, but only 3 registered.
1) I killed the first alien grunt in the tube WITH SCIENCE
2) I zapped the bull-squids and the headcrabs with the... ray emitter thing
3) I gassed the headcrabs in the bio-chamber

I also zapped some grunts (both human and alien) with the second ray emitter in the cryo-chamber, which didn&#39;t count. I feel like a pushed another button, but honestly, I can&#39;t recall.

So, am I missing the 4th and 5th experiment, or did it not register?</description>

            <p>So which experiments are the 4th and 5th?<br>
Are they just not registering by me?</p>
<p>So apparently the 5th experiment is firing the laser with the shield down, frying the caged headcrabs in front of the shield.<br>
This also did not register as an achievement in my playthrough.</p>

            <p>You missed the <span class="bbcode-i">[redacted]</span>-cannon, for starters!  It’s early in the level, I believe after the second experiment you listed.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem of the 4th and 5th experiments not registering.</p>
<p>I feel the following two situations (see screenshots) should be the 4th and 5th ethically questionable experiments:</p>
<p>-zapping grunts (both human and alien) with the second ray emitter in the cryo-chamber<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BwirKbN5yG4/UIGGo3DuzvI/AAAAAAAAABc/PnKFRqjnEo8/s800/2012-10-19_00016.jpg" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>-gassing the headcrabs<br>
*Do you have to enter the chamber of headcrabs and return before gassing them?<br>

            <p>You are missing something. The experiments register correctly.</p>
