    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-never-be-antibot/13587</link>
    <description>Well I have no idea how to explain it,but chapters in half-life 2 is unloadable on steam.Because of two reasons:
i played on mod Half-Life 2 Beta Revived(Alyx and combine solders including rebelians have different skins only-maps don&#39;t changed)
in second one i used back up(i had to off my anti virus program first)and uhm...when i load game and take &quot;New Game&quot; erorr issue comes described as &quot;Can&#39;t load map from invalid handle&quot; and of course it seems to be engine problems.What should I do?</description>

            <p>That’s because they don’t exist. HL2 was only shown at E3 2003.</p>
<p>Also, not a good idea to talk about the leak.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">Moved thread to correct forum.</span></p>
<p>Right-click on Half-Life 2 in Steam and choose Properties.  Go to the Local Files tab and click Verify Integrity of Game Cache.</p>
<p>Once that’s complete, it should download replacements for any corrupted files.</p>
<p>See if that helps.</p>
