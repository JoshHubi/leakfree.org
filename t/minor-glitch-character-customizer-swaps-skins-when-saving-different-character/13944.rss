    <title>Minor Glitch: Character customizer swaps skins when saving different character</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-glitch-character-customizer-swaps-skins-when-saving-different-character/13944</link>
    <description>If you have more than two characters and you apply changes to one of them, it will also change the skin of the other character.

It&#39;s a very minor bug, but i thought it was worth mentioning.

[b]After applying changes to another character, this character reverts it&#39;s skin to a different one. Note how the skin menu still says it&#39;s set on skin 5.[/size][/b]</description>
