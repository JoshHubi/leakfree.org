    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-burn-a-cd-and-then-it-automaticly-start-the-installation-process/3352</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wondering if there was a way I could burn a cd, and when the disc is inserted it automatically starts the installation process, such as a Retail video game or other things of that nature.

Yes I already Googled it. And if it for some reason matters, I&#39;m on a Windows 7 OS.</description>

            <p>well, my question is then, Did you make the installers? If some one else made them they most likely are already programmed using the %PROGRAMFILES% system variable.</p>
<p>If you made the installers replace “c:\programs files” with system variable %PROGRAMFILES%  What that does is it on the fly enters the correct programs file File path for the system it is currently operating on.</p>
<p>EDIT: if the setups are working don’t touch em. Don’t fix whats not broken.</p>

            <p>Um… all I understood was everything before “registry” lol. Also, I know not to include “(86x)” or the double quotes, I used to have an XP 32-bit.<br>
So I’m good, just change it to “\program files\Steam” etc.?</p>
<p>EDIT: wait, if I’m refering to the path that my setup is located in, won’t changing it to just “\Program files” screw it all up? If the installer on the disk extracts everything to the right folder, why would I need to change the path of the setup?<br>
Now that I think of it, if everything that is required is on the installer, and the installer is on the disk, why would it need to point to the Profgam files folder? wouldn’t it just need to point to the setup on the disk?<br>
This is very confusing, to me at least. It’d be simpler just to start it up manually… Bu then again I’m not the kind of person to quit after I’ve started…</p>

            <p>get rid of the double quotes and your all set</p>
<p>Also don’t use c:\Program files (86x)\</p>
<p>because people might not have a c drive, also it is just “Program files” on non 64 bit system, instead use the system variable %PROGRAMFILES%</p>
<p>OR if you want to be pro, Read the flowing key from the registry</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\SourceModInstallPath]</p>

            <p>Okay I’ll try it, but would the text in the file be<br>
“[autorun]<br>
icon=\mod\setup.exe<br>
open=\mod\setup.exe”</p>
<p>Or just<br>
“icon=\mod\setup.exe<br>
open=\mod\setup.exe”?</p>
<p>And also, I have to change “\mod\Setup.exe” to a full path right(c:\Program files (86x)\Steam\Steamapps\Sourcemods\mod\Setup.exe)?</p>
<p>Sorry for the dumb questions but i hate screwing things up because one little mistake.</p>

            <p>Yes in a sense that you only have to click OK for it to start the autorun process.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure it can be anywhere on the CD as long as the autorun.inf is in the root and pointing to the executable correctly.</p>

            <p>if you know the file name of the installer just fucking write it in the autorun.inf file</p>
<p>let’s say you’re planning to have the installer in a folder called Mod and the installer program is called Setup, just do what I wrote in my first post and change icon and open values to =Mod\Setup.exe</p>

            <p>Ok, what I have in mind is, I have these files from a mod, (I have permission to do this from the developers) I wanted to make an installer, which I know how to do, and I wanted to burn that onto a CD. And to make things alittle faster, have it automatically start up the installer. Would I need a more advanced program to do this like nero ar something or would I be able to do this with the built in Windows cd/dvd burner or whatever?</p>

            <p>Well I used to disable autorun on XP back in the day so I kinda like that feature in 7.</p>
<p>What sucks though is even though you’re not supposed to be able to use that from a flash drive, if you get an infected flash drive plugged into your PC, it will spread to any usb storage device you plug to it in the future, regardless of autorun being disabled.</p>

            <p>just a word of caution it only works with exe files. So if you want it to run something like a msc installer you will need to make a launcher executable.  ALSO autorun no longer works on vista/7. All it does now is when the actions window opens there will be an additional option to start the autorun program.</p>
