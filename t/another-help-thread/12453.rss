    <description>Okay then like everyone else i am having trouble getting the game to run/getting it on my steam library. Now it seams like everyone who has the problem always gets asks is it installed in the correct location and do you have Source 2007 installed. the answer is yes for the most part except my steam exists outside of my program files on the C drive because for modding purposes. otherwise the paths line up pretty much perfectly.  IDk what went wrong, i have run  the installer twice both times leading me to ask do you want to run the game? i click yes and it doesn&#39;t work. i did download the archive from atomic gamer mirror and it took 18hours to download, idk if that means anything

If it happens i have to do a clean slate and clear a few folders/files what exactly should i delete.</description>

            <p>Did you restart Steam after installing?  If it installed properly, then Black Mesa should appear in your Steam library after restarting Steam.</p>
