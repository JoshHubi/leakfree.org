<p>Back on thread, you didn’t answer my question about what are your reasons to believe there is a god or souls. A related question: what do you expect to get or achieve by believing there is a god or that you have a soul?</p>

            <p>Gravity bends space-time. This makes time go faster or slower depending on the influence of gravity. Seeing time as a variable in the coordinates of a point is required to come to that. Once you have defined time as another variable in the coordinates of a point, you have defined the fourth dimension. That is really all this is about.</p>

            <p>I don’t know exactly how Physics models the world in 4 dimensions, I just know the math. I would say that there are no “tesseracts” as much as there isn’t any “perfect cube”. A tesseract is a set of points (a “place”) in the 4D universe, it consists of the points that are enclosed by a cube in an interval of time, not a real object.</p>
<p>I personally think of the universe as a set of particles, each particle being a continuous function with time as a domain and the 3 dimensional space as co-domain. The graph of this function, then, is a line in a 4D space. That is how I see things, I’m not sure if that is how Physicians model the universe.</p>

            <p>guga: Thanks for, I guess, ‘dumbing it down’ for me.  However, don’t the laws of thermodynamics now come into play about “creation” and “destruction” of matter/energy?  Aren’t tesseracts and other 4th-dimensional objects conjectural and not “theoretical” (that is, they have no practical usage)?</p>

<p>So, if I have a cube on my desk, and I slide it from one side of my desk to another, am I creating a tesseract, connecting where the cube was to where the cube is now?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First you would have to define a unit of time and a unit of space. For instance, you say that one inch corresponds to one second. Then, if you cube has edges of 2 inches, you would have to create the cube, then destroy the cube after exact 2 seconds without moving it (at least from the perspective of your reference frame). That is a tesseract.</p>
<p>If you let it to exist for more than 2 seconds, you will obtain a 4-dimensional “parallelepiped”. If you move it, you will obtain an “inclined” 4D cube or parallelepiped.</p>
<p>To imagine this, think of the 2D space as one dimension of position and one dimension of time. A square means a line of 1 unit of length stopped from time 0 to time 1, then ceasing to exist after that.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is a problem of your model, not a limitation of Mathematics. A better way to deal with this situation would be to create sets of apples and half-apples. Then you would say that in group A you have two apples and one half-apple, same for group 2, and the union would have four apples and two half-apples.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>A tesseract (4D) is to cube (3D) as cube (3D) is to square (2D) as square (2D) is to line (1D).</p>
<p>By the way, I know it works in mathematics.  But, let’s “oversimplify” a bit to show the limitations of mathematics.  You have three apples.  You cut one apple in half and discard/eat one of the halves.  Now, take three more apples and cut one apple in half, discarding/eating one of the halves.  Now, place four whole apples on the table, then a half apple from each group on the table.</p>
<p>So, let the first group of apples be “A” and let the second group of apples be “B”.</p>
<p>Group A is two and a half apples (2.5)<br>
Group B is two and a half apples (2.5)</p>
<p>How many apples are on the table?  Mathematics would suggest five.</p>
<p>2.5+2.5<br>
(2+2)+(0.5+0.5)<br>
4+1=5</p>
<p>But this suggests five whole apples because the idea was you took the integers to represent whole apples and the fractions to represent the NOT-whole apples.  Is it five whole apples?  Or is it four whole apples and two halves of two different apples?  You can’t combine two half-apples into one whole apple.</p>
<p>It’s like the question my elementary math teacher posed to the class:  If you have five white balloons and five red balloons, how many pink balloons do you have?  The answer is 0 because you can’t (generally) combine balloons.</p>
<p>Also, I can’t get the video to work.  I tried multiple times and it gets through the (very long) list of sponsors and such and I get to the guy that states that the “future is depressing” and that the lecture should be called “We’re all screwed”, but then the video fails.  I can’t get beyond these introductory portions.</p>

<p>4D space/geometry is very real in both physics and mathematics. I suggest you read up a bit (and watch the video I posted) before continuing to draw oversimplified comparisons.</p>

<p>I know that a flat universe is one of the proposed shapes, but I don’t believe that the universe is shaped that way.  See, the problem with 4-dimensional objects such as tesseracts is that they appear to ‘live’ in the world of mathematics alone and do not come into our 3-dimensional world.  We know that 1D is a single dimensionless point dragged along (left-right) to create a line, 2D is that line dragged along (up-down) to create a square, and 3D is that square dragged along (in-out) to create a cube.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension, however, supposedly moves that cube along (???-???) to create a tesseract…but tesseracts have not been shown to exist in real life, have they?  All “real life tesseracts” appear to only be a projection (much like a 3D projection on a 2D surface of a computer screen).  What is that “along” direction?</p>
<p>The math might work, but is there evidence that a tesseract (or other 4th dimensional objects) exist?  As I said, all representations of a tesseract are merely representations and it cannot be constructed…so, is it real?</p>
<p>Currently, our observational reality is reliant on all three dimension (up-down, left-right, in-out).  A three-dimensional object can travel in three dimensions (I take my spindle of blank DVDs and slide it across the table), but is that the fourth dimension?  I say no because it is simply moving in 3D space.</p>
<p>So, long story short (too late!), is there a such thing as a tesseract or 4D space?</p>
<p>Oh, and 1D and 2D space appears to also be simply a mathematical construct because there’s no such thing as a 2D object, right?</p>

<p>I use to be an atheist.  However, I realized one day that one can never know one way or the other if there is a god or souls or anything.</p>
<p>[…] I must admit that nothing is certain, and proof is nowhere to be seen for or against the idea.  Anyone can be right, and I’m just as likely to be wrong as Scientologists and Satanists.</p>

</aside>
<p>You can say we cannot know either way if there is a god or not, but you can’t say the “odds” are the same. It is like saying the odds of gravity existing are the same that the odds of gravity not existing. I think you should have at least a good argumentation to believe that God exists. Do you have one?</p>
<p>In any case, your theory is a lot less of a pushover than the religious theories I’ve heard of, it is a simple theory without many assumptions. Or are there more things that you believe?</p>

            <p>When I took a shitload of drugs I sort of started figuring it out, the universe doesn’t actually have a shape, and it wasn’t created just so that living things could see it, the universe exists to prove the logic that random non-existing numbers being used in equations with other random numbers create SPECIFIC numbers and the universe is calculating every possible combination forever, which results in data. non-logical data has a shorter equation so it disappears quickly, while other results like the cellular organism are always ongoing, with humanity absorbing information all the time, we could be effectively preventing the end of this particular chain of equations, where in another universe where life didn’t exist, all the calculations were done and it collapsed on itself.</p>

            <p>Euhm, yes it can. “Flat” is not a term reserved to Euclidean geometry, only your interpretation of it is.</p>
<p>It is <span class="bbcode-i">four-dimensionally flat</span>. The <span class="bbcode-i">space-time continuum is geometrically flat</span>. Euclidean geometry cannot make any statements about four-dimensional geometry. Ergo <span class="bbcode-i">four-dimensionally flat</span> is non-Euclidean by definition.</p>
<p>Also, there isn’t just “Euclidean geometry” and “non-Euclidean geometry”. Non-Euclidean can entail a range of geometry systems.<br>
Also also, “you can have a closed triangle with two right angles” etc., I believe I just said that.</p>
<p>Btw, if you know about the proposed shapes of the universe, why are we arguing about this? A flat universe is one of the proposed shapes…</p>
