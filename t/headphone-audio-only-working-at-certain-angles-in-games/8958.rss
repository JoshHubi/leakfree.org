    <title>Headphone audio only working at certain angles in games.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/headphone-audio-only-working-at-certain-angles-in-games/8958</link>
    <description>My computer&#39;s audio has, at least in games, been acting very strange lately. I&#39;ve been trying to narrow it down, and from what I can tell, the audio will only play from certain angles; from what I can tell, my computer is trying to send signals to speakers I don&#39;t have. All my attempts to reconfigure them have been unsuccessful, so I&#39;m assuming that I&#39;ve missed something.

I&#39;m using windows 7, and my drivers are apparently Conexant HD audio.

I&#39;ve been looking all over and can&#39;t find anything, so if anyone here could help me, that would be great.</description>

            <p>Make sure you speaker settings are configured to headphones or stereo mode. I’ve had a similar thing happen as it was configured for 5.1 surround sound.</p>

<p>Also check the specific manufacturer settings if your car has it’s own configuration area.</p>

<p>When I had it on 5.1 all of the things in front of me were playing on my nonresistant center channel. As well with the rear channels.</p>

            <p>I believe I’ve tried all that, but I haven’t been able to find a control panel for the Conexant drivers. I’m going to try reinstalling them.</p>

            <p>On the off chance you haven’t tried, set audio output as stereo in<br>
-windows audio settings<br>
-audio driver control panel<br>
-the game settings</p>
<p>Alternatively, try using the headphone output of the sound card.</p>
