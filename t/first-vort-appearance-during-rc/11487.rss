            <p>I don’t believe the teleport sequence is ‘final’. Once Xen is done I expect the devs will add the Xen teleport sections to the sequence and may change the vort part.</p>

            <p>That sounds just about right. So, in the end, it’s two sides fighting each other, with both fighting in self-defence, but neither knowing the other does the same… oh what a pointless slaughter of two intelligent species… (yeah, Vorts ARE intelligent species)</p>

            <p>Vortigaunt’s don’t attack sometimes as a form of passive rebellion. In Black Mesa they were scared, frightened and possibly traumatized from being forced into an unfamiliar environment in the blink of their multiple large eyes. On Xen they passively rebelled by not fighting unless supervised by a controller. In Black Mesa they heard gunshots everywhere, not to mention corpses of their comrades and friends everywhere. You’ve played Episode Two, they are highly defensive of those they trust. They went to an absurd amount of effort to keep Alyx alive. Basically? If they’re on your side, they’re all you need. They can slaughter hordes Antlions in minutes. They were confused and didn’t know Gordon wasn’t an attacker.</p>

            <p>It’s like vorts in Interloper factory don’t attack you, but once thay’re supervised by controllers, they must attack you. Maybe it’s the same here? They help however they can, whenever they have an opportunity to break through their enslaved minds for a while. Controllers seem to have some unspoken influence over their minds (hence their name), but then again, vorts around Black Mesa attack you even though they’re not supervised.</p>

            <p>I would hazard a guess that Valve didn’t really know or care what they were doing specifically in the first place back in 1998.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  It seems that much of the weight of these types of things gets added after the fact.</p>

            <p>It is slightly weird isn’t it.  Why do they do that weird hand waving gesture?  Are they saying Hi?</p>
<p>Perhaps their not aggressive towards you because the war had not yet begun.</p>

<p>They sent him back?<br>
As I see it, he just got teleported back by the glitchy cascade.</p>
<p>I’ll have to play it again and check it out.</p>
<p>Edit;  luckily I had an autosave just before the cascade, so I was able to quickly check it out.  They vorts don’t do anything other than come towards you.  Two of them wave their hands, possibly in an attempt to massage your nipples.<br>
You could read into this any way you want.  Since there is no energy coming from their hands, it really doesn’t appear as though they are the ones sending you back.  Maybe they’re just greeting you.<br>
I always thought the cascade was just bouncing you back and forth (which also happened in HL2’s teleport sequence)</p>
<p>They always look stupidly happy because that’s just how the model is.  Perhaps it would have been better for the devs to have copied the original a bit closer and had them surrounding Gordon in the dark (although that scene hardly made any sense in the original)</p>
