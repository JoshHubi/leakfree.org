    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/would-you-play-multiplayer/6706</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just wondering how many people in the community actually care about the multiplayer component of the game that may or my not be released at some time after the single player portion of the game.</description>

            <p>Jethrosoup could post the same pic towards your post, as he is well aware. He was blatantly stating the obvious. Why? Bc it’s fun, especially when you get to talk about masturbation.</p>

            <p>I’d probably play it occasionally. I rarely play Half Life 2: Deathmatch, and even then, if I wanted to, there probably won’t be very many people in servers. I’m mostly in this for the single player. Co-op sounded really interesting until it was canceled.</p>

            <p>I always liked Perfect Dark’s DM, as that’s what I played most. It’s just a pity you can’t find anyone online playing the XBLA port.</p>
<p>I’ve had some good times with HLDM, when at the time, I had no idea what I was playing. I just knew it came with CS disks. LAN games were always the best. Nowadays the servers are just filled with sims, er, bots.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t agree here. It’s very interessting for all oldschool fans and people who didn’t try hl1dm so far. Whether or not it’s going to be played depends pretty much on the quality and the features of the mod. I like only 2 deathmatch games and these are HLDM and Quakeworld… and since these games pretty much died because of their age, BMDM will be something suitable and valuable imo.</p>

            <p>personally, we need a good source MP game. most source mods(excluding gmod) don’t hold a very big community anymore. in fact, even gmod is dying.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I may play it for the rest of my life when it’ll be designed for competition and fun… Just like Adrenaline Gamer was. Imo a voting menu with matchmaking options is a must for BMDM.<br>
It will also be very important to have an improved netcode that can handle fast gameplay… because that’s one of the few things that really suck in HLDM… netcode and hit registration.</p>
<p>When I tried out AG2 aka. HL2DM pro I was shocked, because it wasn’t able to reproduce HL1’s gamestyle and gameplay.<br>
For example:<br>
I played Stalkyard and you were able to pull every weapon down the boxes in the storage hall using your gravgun. It didn’t make any sense to climb up all the boxes, because it would make you too slow. You weren’t even able to bunnyhop over them, because you didn’t have the same jumphight like in HL1. In HL2 you don’t jump as high as in HL1 using a normal jump.</p>
<p>I hope BM will faithfully rebuild all essencial gameplay elements HLDM had… including jumphight, bhop, circlejumps, driftjumps, wallgauss, spawnchain, spawn delay, rampslides, footstep sound volume, unmovable items/weapons in the map, crossbow jumps, the ability to steal an enemy rocket using your own RPG laser, HLDM gamespeed (I hope you won’t use max_speed “320” in BM, because that is just too fast for precise aiming… Call me a noob but as soon as it laggs a little bit it gets impossible to foresee that lag and take it into account), climbing, sliding and having the same delay on switching a weapon on every weapon (In HL2DM for example, you need more time to switch to your RPG than to switch to your assault rifle. It shouldn’t be like that.).</p>
<p>One more advice and comment on the hit registration in HL2DM/AG2: Some weapons (shotgun) have a better hit reg. than other weapons (magnum, gauss…)<br>
You should care a lot about making weapons behave less random like they did in AG2, because shotgun is really overpowered in that game. You only have to roughly aim near the enemy model and it will allways hit, while you won’t hit with Gauss or Magnum when you exactly aim ON the enemy model -&gt; blankshots when aiming exact and using gauss/magnum -&gt; hits when aiming only rough using sprayweapons.<br>
I hope you won’t have that aimbot-like effect when using shotgun in BMDM.</p>

            <p>Well I dont think it’s that easy to steal frags in HLDM imo… And when I play TDM I am rather thankful when one of my mates helps me to kill enemies… because that gives me room to get my equipment complete --&gt; I will become stronger and will be able to make more frags by myself.</p>
