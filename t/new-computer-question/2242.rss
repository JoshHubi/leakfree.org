    <description>Alright, I may be getting the following soon. Since I am not as savvy as some of you with computers, I ask these questions:
1) Is this good?
2) How much would a CPU like this cost?

Alright, here goes:

Intel® Core™ i7-975 processor Extreme Edition(8MB L3 Cache, 3.33GHz)
8GB Dual Channel DDR3 SDRAM at 1066MHz - 4 DIMMs
500GB 7200 RPM SATA Hard Drive
ATI Radeon HD 5870 1GB GDDR5</description>

<p>Well the supply shortage is over. For a higher price premium you can actually buy one.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I would suggest getting a Gigabyte MA790X-UD4P motherboard then a Phenom II dual or tri core. About 4gb of ram and a ATI 4870. It’s pretty cheap and would get the job done. Or you could get a DX11 card like a 5750.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t think what you posted is overkill. I personally think i7’s are overpriced and I always go AMD. It really depends on what type of games you play, for source games all you really need is a 4850 or 4870.</p>
<p>I would love to have a 5870. :jizz:</p>

            <p>Personally, having been a dell customer for years, I highly recommend that you do not buy your computer from them. In recent years their customer service has hit the crapper, their hardware and pricing is off the wall, and it never seems to last all that long. I would seriously recommend buying an HP computer. They stock some very excellent hardware and ship it very quickly, with excellent customer support. The cases make more sense when you open them up, everything is tied together properly and there is always room for extras if you wish such as extra hard drive bays and open PCI-E slots.(not the case with dell) Take a look at what they have, I think you will be impressed.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just my opinion about ram… the whole frequency rating bull (DDR 400, DDR2 800, DDR3 1600) is a product of rambus marketing nonsense. DDR essentially simulates a wider buswidth, not a higher frequency.</p>
<p>The actual bits still take 5ns to go from on to off and vise versa in DDR 400 and DDR3 1600. In other words, the actual modules (chips) themselves still operate at 200mhz, there is just some clever interleaving of signals which, again, simulate a wider bus and not a higher frequency.</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve made a commitment to <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> buy 133mhz or 166mhz dimms. I don’t care what generation it is from (SDR, DDR3), or if the current gen of CPUs don’t have the chops to handle that kind of raw throughput yet, I’m getting 200mhz or better. I think doing otherwise is a waste of money, especially as DDR2/DDR3 ram prices continue to tick up.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed a couple causes for real concern even with the very limited information provided.<br>
That processor IS overkill for most anyone, but it does tell us the mobo is an X58 mobo.<br>
One of the main reasons to go with the i7 900 series processors and the x58 chipset is the ability to use triple channel memory. This system has a pair of dual channel memory kits. While that isn’t really going to limit you, it does imply it is one of the cheap ass x58 mobos that do not have triple channel memory configuration. So you are getting a really low end board for that super high end processor. On that alone I would say avoid that system.</p>

            <p>Alright then. I’ll ask him what other processors I could get. I’m not even going to go near that damn Dell site and try and figure out what my options are.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
I do alot more then game on my PC. I run two restaurants and a small photography company. But the computer I have now can handle everything I need there for now.</p>

            <p>It really depends. I personally think that the i7 series is overkill, as processors play less a part in games as they used too.</p>

        <title>New Computer Question</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, my (6 year old) computer just bit the dust today and I can’t play any games. Everything else works, but when my computer tries to run a game and put my video card under pressure, I get BSOD. I know it’s not the card, cause I just got it about 7 months ago. I was talking to my brother and he said he could get me a new Dell for around $1,500 (I believe he said the i7 920 now that I think about it). I am willing to pay this much, but my question was, is it worth it?</p>

<p>What motherboard?</p>
<p>Also, The i7 920 is good enough, you can just overclock the 920 (Goes to 4ghz quite easily)</p>
