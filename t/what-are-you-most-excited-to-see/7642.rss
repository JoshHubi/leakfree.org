    <description>What are you looking forward to seeing in black mesa source

I would say black mesa in its prime, before the Resonance Cascade, and the lambda core.</description>

<p>I’m buying a Razer Tiamat 7.1 headset specifically for BMS and the rest of the HL series. I only hope the onboard audio of the Asus Maximus V Formula Z77 does it justice.</p>
<p>The audio aspect is so often overlooked in games. I’m super excited to know that so much has gone into this aspect of the game!<br>
It therefore makes me a little sad that there won’t be any raging thunderstorms throughout the game ( :’( ), as that would be truly awesome to hear. I looove storms, I go for walks in them whenever one starts.</p>

            <p>Agreed. The impact of the train ride on my brain remains unsurpassed, and it will never happen again.<br>
It was 1998, it had never been done before, and little did we know at that point in the game that the rest of the game would be full of even more innovative stuff that Half-Life is now known for.</p>
<p>So Black Mesa Inbound is what I’m mostly looking forward to.</p>
<p>Off topic: Unreal’s second level (Nyleve’s Falls) also made an impression I’ll never ever forget: in the beginning, the moment you leave the crashed spaceship (Vortex Rikers) and you come into the open air: the atmosphere, the beautiful sights, bunnies, flying creatures, but especially the music.</p>

            <p>^ Ha! I knew I wasn’t alone on this. For me it’s like the breath before the storm so to speak.<br>
As for which weapon I am most looking for to wielding that has got to be the Gluon Gun. As Bjossi says there is nothing quite like the feel of a weapon that has such a kick it makes you a little scared. :rabies:</p>

            <p>Suddenly I just thought it trough, and realised that it seems there is nothing in Black Mesa that I won’t be satisfied with.<br>
But I’m really excited to see the monorail ride tbh.</p>

            <p>I liked the pulse gun’s sound the most, with a good subwoofer every single shot from that thing felt like I was being punched in the stomach. Guns that feel powerful make me feel like a god when firing them. The shotgun and .357 are also awesome in this regard.</p>

            <p>I think the coolest character interaction moment has got to be the intoduction for the Tau Cannon - a.k.a. Gauss Gun.<br>
Kevin &amp; Mike’s performance is imo far superior to the original rendition.<br>
I actually heard both and was surprised to find that out.</p>
