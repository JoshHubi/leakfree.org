    <title>How to bring own textures into the game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-bring-own-textures-into-the-game/14124</link>
    <description>Hey guys. Yesterday I tried to get some textures in Black Mesa for my map.
I used VTFedit to create the TGAs into vmt and vtf files. After that I placed them into Black Mesa/bms/materials/dm_pro_crossfire
When I launched Black Mesa/bin/hammer.exe, I was able to find the textures in the texture-browser but they where pink and black squares...
What am I doing wrong? Maybe I use the wrong version of VTFedit? I think there are different textures for different source engine versions.
Help pls  :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Ah… Ok I found the error… My vmt files still had the wrong file-paths in them, because first I converted the TGA to VMT in a seperate folder and after that I moved the files into the BM materials folder… Seems like I have to set the “output folder” directly to the subfolder in bms/materials when I use VTFedit: Tools-&gt;Convert Folder… Otherwise I had to correct all the vmt files manually. It works now. Thx for the tip  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Post your VMTs. Can’t really diagnose too well without them. Be sure everything is spelled correctly.</p>
<p>Here’s what one of mine looks like for reference:</p>
<p>[code]“LightMappedGeneric”<br>
{<br>
“$baseTexture” “concrete\concplates01a”<br>
“$bumpmap” “concrete\concplates01_normal”<br>
“$surfaceprop” “concrete”</p>
<pre><code>"$envmap" "env_cubemap"
"$envmaptint" "[.05 .05 .05]"
"$normalmapalphaenvmapmask" 1
"$envmapsaturation" 1

"$detail" "detail\bm_concrete_detail_01"
"$detailscale" 8
"$detailblendfactor" 1
"$detailblendmode" 0

"%keywords" "fd; bms; crypt"
</code></pre>

            <p>You have to link your .vtf texture location in the .vmt file.</p>
