    <title>Modifying BM levels?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/modifying-bm-levels/14087</link>
    <description>How are people creating modifications to the levels in BM? Have the hammer files for the levels been released or are people just decompiling/extracting the bsp? Also if it&#39;s the latter, are there any issues/complications with this method and can someone point me to useful info to get started? Thanks</description>

            <p>Yes, they’re using software to decompile the bsps. It’s not perfect, and it often causes lots of little problems, breaking optimization (esp. areaportals) that you have to hunt And fix for stuff to work, sometimes even compile properly. The BM devs plan to release their source VMFs later (IIRC), so that’s worth waiting for if you don’t want any issues.</p>
