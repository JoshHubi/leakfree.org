    <title>[UPDATE 23/11/18] Pre-Disaster: Unforeseen Consequences</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/update-23-11-18-pre-disaster-unforeseen-consequences/14428</link>
    <description>[UPDATED. FIXED. Workshop Link!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756630472)

Since getting into mapping perhaps a month ago, I&#39;ve started work on getting Unforeseen Consequences to its Pre-Disaster state. I&#39;m not making it how it would have been on the &#39;morning&#39; of the incident, rather the day before, as there were system crashes and all sorts of problems on the morning of the incident.
I&#39;ve started working from the top labs of Sector B, seen immediately after Sector C, and am working my way down. Meanwhile, Admiral Sakai (the person who gave me this idea and has already done most of Office Complex here: [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28435-BMPD-Pre-Disaster-Maps/&#39;]BMPD: Pre-Disaster Maps[/url] ) will be starting from the end of UC at the Office Complex elevator and will be working his way up, until we meet.

As of now, I&#39;ve got [i]half[/i] of c1a1c (the first map of UC that doesn&#39;t involve Sector C) to its pre-disaster state, though it&#39;s basic so far with little to no NPCs.
I&#39;m working on getting the playable area of the map to be converted into its working state, then afterwards I shall work on the corridors that you can&#39;t get to, behind doors etc. as Admiral Sakai has done in his Office Complex maps.

As Admiral has said in his Office Complex post, the actbusy system is limiting and hard to get sorted right now, so the NPCs are pretty much doing one action until something might be fixed by the devs.

[b]Images (WIP):[/b]

The main hallway. Fits right in with Anom. Materials.

[b][img]https://i.imgur.com/ysamMiP.jpg[/img][/b]

I can&#39;t wait to start planning what&#39;s behind the door at the end here (the one where the zombie is burning and debris has fallen in the singleplayer chapter). More labs, and perhaps we could finally see the huge server coolant room... Oooh, could be another map.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/Zy62ugF.jpg[/img]

The science lab. I removed all frosted overlays, icy terrain and particle effects. Then I had to get all of the props rotated back to normal and brighten the lighting a little.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/1vswfQa.jpg[/img]

Storage/maintenance room 1! I&#39;m still not entirely happy with the lighting here, maybe it feels a little bland. Though, I suppose [i]anything[/i] feels bland after walking out of the brightly-lit labs. Let me know what you guys think:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/3zw2Oyd.jpg[/img]

The elevator - and it works! A moving two-stop elevator from the top (third) floor to the bottom (first). I neglected to make it a three-stop elevator and add on an entire floor, because, well. That&#39;s an entire floor - anything could be there. Though I&#39;ll still do a comprehensive diagram of Sector B hopefully, with what I think each floor and section means.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/gwChM6p.jpg[/img]

Y&#39;know how in Sector B there seems to be a lot of closed-off, small passages with a forklift coming out of it? I decided to expand on this a little bit in maintenance room #2 (once you get out of the elevator), and add in an unreachable section of storage beyond the passageway. I also moved the forklift and box back, as not _everything_ might have been in the same place a day before the incident.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/O1t1gCm.jpg[/img]

The storage room looks quite nice when lit up:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/g5rYRFA.jpg[/img]

With brighter lights (and a larger falloff distance), these corridors looked like they were actually used. Though, with the textures used, they still look quite dark, they are more corridors to [i]get [/i]to somewhere rather than _work_ in. Also, I&#39;ve removed the frost overlays on the windows and inside the rooms and moved the coolant &#39;vats&#39; to be attached to their pipes again.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/Jg6nlP8.jpg[/img]

So, _what is the point of this area?_ it was in both Half-Life and Black Mesa with not much in the way of expansion or [i]sense [/i]added to it. It&#39;s just a detour off the corridor with a little open room that has a vent and a few pipes (which would normally be in the ceiling anyway). There is a ladder, so perhaps this would have been a little storage area for the maintenance guy&#39;s stuff? He wouldn&#39;t keep it in the huge storage warehouse. Perhaps that&#39;s it:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/XYS8g2q.jpg[/img]

Though I have already brightened this area up a fair bit, it still looks unattractive and too &#39;maintenancey&#39;. It&#39;s still part of the laboratories technically, and so I&#39;ll need to brighten it up and perhaps change the colour slightly to a more whitish tone than warm colours. I don&#39;t want to change the colour of lights [i]too [/i]much though, as that wouldn&#39;t have been changed by the incident - only the brightness.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/O0reTPr.jpg[/img]

Going through the map revealed an astounding amount of wall-plates lying next to the uncovered pipes. I simply won&#39;t believe that the resonance cascade caused the plates to fall off and lean on the wall perfectly like that. Though the BM devs might have just done it to break up monotony, perhaps this area was under heavy maintenance? With all the ladders lying around and various toolboxes etc. it could mean perhaps this area was under upgrading or simply fixing some problems in the pipes.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/srR8Kh6.jpg[/img]

As I&#39;ve said, Admiral Sakai and I will be working on UC it seems, and hopefully many more chapters to come! Please give me feedback - plenty of feedback. Suggest what you think might be behind closed doors, or what some of those rooms are for, or what those exposed parts of walls are for. I will eventually conduct a review of Sector B and an overall layout. Stay tuned!</description>

Ok I’ve been going around all 3 maps, and took screenshots of oddities or bugs in the level.<br>
First thing I found was this broken monitor in the guard room u can unlock, seems off when every other monitor is not broken, even in the canals.<br>
Oddity 2 is the back of the security door looks like this, additionally the front of the door never changes to green, indicating it is open. Additionally this door has a bug that makes it close while the player is still in the middle of the door, which is an instant death.<br>
Bug 2 is invis wall in this particular control room, I believe others have mentioned this bug, but I am going to include it none the less.<br>
Oddity 3, this vent still appears broken. which doesn’t make much sense in pre disaster. this is the only vent I could find broken.<br>
Bug 3 this door is locked which is fine, but this actually causes a soft lock if you jump down into the water of the main canal where the large bridge is, if you jump down, you cannot re-access any part of the map without no-clip as access via this door is impossible from both sides, and there’s no ladder access to the other side of the canal where the doors are not locked, hence why I able labelling this one a bug rather than odd.<br>
Oddity 4, the picture pretty much explains it, and I believe others have explained this odd goniometry too.<br>
EDIT: oddity 5, all the canal signs are off center.<br>
Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>The pre disaster is looking real good so far.<br>
May i recommend a stairwell between the upper layers of the labs and the lower layer coolant reserves. As an alternative from using the elevators.<br>
Additionally, the new area added feels currently a little empty… possiblity of adding further rooms along some of the empty walls? Maybe an additional conference room or other variates of rooms seen in anomalous materials?<br>
The door in the coolant reserves, the one that opens during the pizza quest, displays an incorrect texture on the back, where the security name is backwards and the front still shows locked. Additionally 1 of the tv mointors still show to be broken.<br>
I cannot wait to see how you expand upon the coolant reserves area.</p>

<p>Thanks for letting me know about those things, they’ll be fixed in a future patch.<br>
And yeah, just like Sakai said, transitions aren’t being added right now but it’s definitely something I’d like to implement in the future. It’s something that Sakai and myself would have to implement in each of our maps, and requires some coordination there because of how it works.</p>

            <p>He can’t connect to Anomalous Materials because that map hasn’t been released; also the elevator transition to Office Complex is kind of complex and may take some time to implement.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember this?</p>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756630472" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WORKSHOP UPDATE</a>[/size]<br>
That’s right, thought it was about time for an update… didn’t actually realise it has been 2 <span class="bbcode-i">years </span>since the last Workshop update, simply because I’ve had most of the map on an updated version on my computer for half of that time, sitting there, waiting to be finished and uploaded…<br>
So here it is.</p>
<p>All maps no longer crash on startup.<br>
The first map now has a new area, beyond the “airlock” doors on the top floor. This area extends the labs and its main purpose is to provide personnel access to the bottom floor, rather than having to use the maintenance elevator. A locker room and HEV area is also added. Take a look around! Many, many other improvements too.<br>
The second map has a number of improvements. The big elevator can now be controlled by the player, so you don’t have to wait for it to go allll the way down before going back up again. This also means you can stop properly at the platform not on ground level. I think I’ll make the speed faster though…<br>
The last map, I don’t remember what I’ve done to it, but I’m certain it has improvements since 2 years ago too. Check it all out![/size][/size]</p>

<p>Wow, thanks for the link - always have had bad experiences with decompilers in the past so I thought decompiling would be a waste of time. However, bar a few odd things like areaportals messing up sometimes, everything is good!<br>
I guess it didn’t end up too bad, really. Cancel my last post, the project’s back on and I’m working on an update on the workshop!</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-s">Hey guys, I’m back. And I’ve messed up big time.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s">Let’s just say that the current versions of the Pre-Disaster Sector B maps on the workshop are the definitive and last versions of these maps. I’ve lost the source files.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s">I was wanting to get back into some Hammer today as I got inspired to work on these again and add more areas etc (there is a new WIP area that I made last year in the .bsp for c1a1c that I still have). However, I noticed the source files were missing.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s">I upgraded my computer at the very end of last year - new SSD for Windows and everything. Moved everything I wanted out of the old HDD, except my .vmf files for these maps was regretfully on the old HDD’s windows desktop. I didn’t copy stuff out of there since it was just shortcuts to apps, forgetting that the .vmfs were there. That would’ve been fine and I could have gone to get the files right now if it weren’t for the fact that I formatted the old HDD. So the files are gone.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s">I’m pretty pissed off at myself and what’s especially tantalizing is that I can play the most recent WIP version of the map right now, as the compiled .bsps of my maps are still in the Black Mesa folder. So, I’ve got the most recent version of the map (with some things fixed from the current workshop release and new areas WIP), but I don’t have the means to continue on it due to the loss of the .vmfs.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s">Lesson learned. I guess I should pick a new chapter to do a pre-disaster version of, because I feel like mapping some more.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"><span class="bbcode-i">TL <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> R - The .vmf files for these Pre-Disaster maps are gone, so I can no longer work on these and the Workshop version as it stands is the final version of these maps.</span></span><span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-s"></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Decompiled the .bsps, all sorted. Work is continuing on BMPD!</span></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Now that Part 3 is released, I’m going back to the first map and adding the area beyond the glass doors at the very start of the map. Since the lobby on the bottom floor has a lift, I’m connecting that to the area I’m building on the top floor, as a science personnel lift. After all, they wouldn’t use the maintenance lift found in the already-existing part of the map. Also, a small kitchen area like the one found in Sector C, and a H.E.V. room too. Very similar in style to Sector C, as they both seem to have the same design and construction, in the same time period as eachother. I’ll show some pics later.</p>

<p>Edit: Admiral Sakai, the lift at the end of this map will link to your Office Complex PD’s first map once it is released. I think I’m going to return to the first map (c1a1c) and begin expanding that top floor of the Anomalous Materials-ish area.</p>

<p>Thanks for those few bits of feedback. I don’t know why, but I never bothered to roll back to CU2 and upload c1a1d until now. I guess it was just me wanting to be on CU3 because of all the new features, but since I’m not actually playing BM normally (just mapping), it’s fine rolling back. (<span class="bbcode-i">Devs, would be really great for you to fix the bm_publish tool not working!</span><span class="bbcode-i">)</span><br>

I thought giving the security guard a pizza to get into the office was a cool idea- actually, having quests to get into restricted areas is something I’m thinking of implementing myself. However, there’s two things that would make this better- one is to have the guard do some kind of button-pressing animation to unlock the door, and the other is having it stay unlocked once you leave the first time (since the guard now “owes you one”).</p>

Making the elevator two-way was very nice of you, but it’s still <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> slow. I think you can just turn the speed up a fair bit, but if it starts jiggling the physics props you’ll need to add additional path_tracks to make the acceleration gradual. (This is kind of complicated and took me a while to figure out how to do, so if you get stuck don’t hesitate to PM me).</p>
<p>I preface this by saying that I haven’t got my monitor working exactly right and so the problem might just be me, but it also seems like the map is <span class="bbcode-i">extremely</span> yellow. Does anyone else see this? If it turns out to be a universal thing, I’d suggest increasing the intensity and decreasing the saturation of many of the lights.</p>

Maybe, instead of the loading trigger, put some invisible useable_ladders discretely around the pipes so that players can climb out using them- from inside, it actually looks like you <span class="bbcode-i">should</span> be able to grab onto the ledge on top, it’s just that the player can’t get their feet all the way over it.</p>

            <p>One problem I see in all of the Pre-Disaster maps that if you throw something at someone, they get damaged from it to the point that if you repeat this process, you can <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">kill</span></span> them. I did that with a few security guards and I acquired a Glock. It doesn’t happen when you play the Anomalous Materials chapter, believe me I tried.</p>
