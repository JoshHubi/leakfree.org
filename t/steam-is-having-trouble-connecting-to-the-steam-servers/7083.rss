    <title>Steam is having trouble connecting to the steam servers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-is-having-trouble-connecting-to-the-steam-servers/7083</link>
    <description>Today, i was trying to connect steam to my account on my new pc. When i type in my password and hit enter, i get a box that says &quot;having trouble connecting to the steam servers&quot;. I&#39;ve tried editing the blob file twice. The first time, it displayed a window saying a purchase was being processed. The second time, it repeated the connection error. How can i fix it?
EDIT: It&#39;s saying that my password is wrong now. I&#39;m going through the correct steps, however, when i get the email, my account question is not what i set it to be. Instead, it says &quot;What did customer support last reset your passphrase to?&quot;</description>
