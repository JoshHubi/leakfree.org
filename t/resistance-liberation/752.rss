<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Im sure I’ll get flamed for saying this but: I recommend the thread being closed now. Not too sure anyone needs to be able to post any more to it, though keeping the discussion visable would be beneficial to some (those who are not ignorant).</p>

            <p>Wow. That’s a hell of a story about your grandfather. I know very little of my own German family history, but I know my great grandfather was drafted into the Luftwaffe because he’d had some minor role in whatever proto-air force Germany had in WW1, and also was watched very closely by the SS because his father had been a socialist and union member. The point is being in the German armed forces in the years of WW2 doesn’t make someone automatically a bad guy or a Nazi. Very well written post.</p>
<p>Additional note for those fond of antiquated national epithets, it’s spelled ‘<span class="bbcode-i">kraut</span>’.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nobody seeks to deny the crimes of the Nazi regime less than me. I was born and raised in modern day Germany, and the guilt for the crimes of our grandfathers is planted deep inside our brains, never to be erased again.<br>
It would just be something different and completely new for me to play a WW2 FPS from the perspective of a German soldier. A Wehrmacht soldier, that is. Not all Germans in the years of 1939 to 1945 were Nazis. Nazi was only who belonged to the ruling political party in Germany. And even some of those who had become members of that party, mostly for reasons of personal benefit, did not agree with what the Führer considered to be the best for Germany.<br>
I was talking about being able to play from the perspective of a single German soldier who refuses to become a war criminal and instead defects from duty. There were many of these during World War II, but most of them were never heard of again. Hitler’s Wehrmacht and the SS had their ways of dealing with such “traitors” who had the balls and brains to question ruthless orders.</p>
<p>My own granddad was 17 when they sent him to the eastern front in 1945, by the time that front was only a few kilometers away from Berlin. They tatooed his arm with SS-runes and put him in a SS-uniform, as they did with all other child-soldiers in that last line of defense. They told them that, if the Russians would catch them alive and see that they belonged to the SS, they would torture them to death. My granddad only survived because he managed to cut the tatooed piece of flesh from his arm with a bayonet and steal a normal Wehrmacht uniform from a dead comrade. At least that’s what my grandma told me about him. I remember seeing the huge scar on his arm back in my childhood, when he was still alive.</p>
<p>Not all German soldiers were monsters in those days. Most of them were just that - soldiers. People with guns who had been told to obey orders, and never to question their superiors. Many of those who invaded Poland actually believed in the propaganda story that Polish forces had opened fire first. Just as firmly as American soldiers today might believe that 9/11 was not an inside job, but an actual terrorist attack on their country.</p>
<p>I won’t put the USA and Nazi Germany on the same level, now - nor will I start a discussion about conspiracy theories - I just want to hint at the possibility that shit like WWII could also have happened in a different place, different time. All those crimes could also have been committed by completely different people - under similar circumstances. Just present the people of a country with a ruined economy, mass unemployment, inflation, and then coerce them into believing that it’s only the fault of a small, distinctive minority living among them. Promise them to do something about it if they give you the power to do so, and they will! And they will give a shit about what you do with that power. People are fucking dumb. And considering the recent news, they haven’t grown any smarter since 1945.</p>

            <p>This gives me a good basis for an alternate-history story. World War II consisting of three world powers. Allies vs Axis vs Bob, a gun wielding sociopath hell-bent on causing the downfall of the other two powers single-handedly, and become the sole dictator of the world.</p>
<p>In the sequel, he must defend his title from other lone nutjobs.</p>

And you played that type of thing with OF though didnt you? I mean, the same concept at least. On the bad guys side, trying to kill Freeman. And if there was a new OF to come out, on the side of the Combine, you would be doing the same thing. Both HECU and the Combine lose.</p>

            <p>There are ww2 games that do allow you to play Germans they are all mainly stratigey games sutch as Blitzkrige (hope spelled correctly ) also</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I have always wondered why there are no German campaigns in WWII Games. It’s not like you have to be part of the Waffen-SS Elite or of the death squads. There were heroes in the Wehrmacht as well. Heroes who denied their orders to kill civilians, overthrew their commanding officers and defected from duty to help those they were supposed to hunt and kill. They have only never been talked about, because that would make the Wehrmacht soldiers seem less evil, more human. It would include the possibility of thought that maybe every human - under the given circumstances - could be pressed to commit such terrible crimes.</p>
<p>There is an old anti-war-movie called “Steiner - das Eiserne Kreuz 2” (The Iron Cross) which features a couple of German soldiers defecting from their assignment in order to establish contact with the allied forces because they want to surrender to the Americans, rather than continue the mindless killing. I - as a German - would love to play from such a point of view.</p>
<hr>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Wehrmacht was more human then the SS. They were not the murders of the SS and did not excute prisoners. I would rather have surendered to the Wehrmacht and the german air force then the SS</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Killing American soldiers is pretty taboo in America, and the media would probably condemn them as Nazi sympathizers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ever herd of Blitzkrige mate lol you kill French,Russians,Brits,and Americans. Were have you been. It’s WW2 and then if what you say is true there would be no online multiplayer for cod1-5 and the expanstions.</p>

<p>Pretty hypocritical, since this is a half-life forum.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of a game where you play in the German army. It’s not like they were all bad people, they were just patriots fighting for their country in the same way that American soldiers did. In addition many were drafted and forced to fight.</p>
<p>The main problem is the way the media would portray them. Killing American soldiers is pretty taboo in America, and the media would probably condemn them as Nazi sympathizers.</p>

            <p>Unless the KKK makes a game where America actually accepted Hitler’s offer to join the Axis and end up winning the war for them.<br>
(I by no means support such a game. Hitler can burn in hell for all I care.)</p>

<p>Good point - I have already thought of that. The defection could take place somewhere near the eastern front, so you’d have to be aware for Russian and German soldiers at first, then the SS, while you are trying to make your way through Nazi Germany to the western front, where you want to surrender to the Allies. The first attempts to do so fail, however, and you have to fight your way out of a battle with British and American soldiers firing at you, reattempting to establish a situation that you can use to surrender without being killed. For instance, you could witness American paratroopers killing POWs because they’d slow them down, so you have to find another way to relative safety. Not to mention the French resistance trying to take advantage of the invasion and killing off as many German troops as possible without taking prisoners. Enemies on all sides, so to speak. Well, there is no such game, so my rabble is mostly pointless, I presume.</p>

<p>EDIT: Now that I remember, The Outfit, a terrible WWII game, replaced the American Captain with a defected German officer after he died. The German had the cheapest move, “fake surrender” where he would walk with his hands up to an enemy squad with his men and then open fire with a hunting shotgun.</p>

            <p>I have always wondered why there are no German campaigns in WWII Games. It’s not like you have to be part of the Waffen-SS Elite or of the death squads. There were heroes in the Wehrmacht as well. Heroes who denied their orders to kill civilians, overthrew their commanding officers and defected from duty to help those they were supposed to hunt and kill. They have only never been talked about, because that would make the Wehrmacht soldiers seem less evil, more human. It would include the possibility of thought that maybe every human - under the given circumstances - could be pressed to commit such terrible crimes.</p>
<p>There is an old anti-war-movie called “Steiner - das Eiserne Kreuz 2” (The Iron Cross) which features a couple of German soldiers defecting from their assignment in order to establish contact with the allied forces because they want to surrender to the Americans, rather than continue the mindless killing. I - as a German - would love to play from such a point of view.</p>
