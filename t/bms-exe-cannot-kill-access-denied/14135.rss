    <title>bms.exe cannot kill - access denied</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-exe-cannot-kill-access-denied/14135</link>
    <description>Was playing the game as normal after some saved loads to get those &#39;chieves.
Click Quit game via the menu normally.
Game screen was frozen for about 15 seconds (longer than normal) then I was returned to Steam.
bms.exe was still executing in the background - noticed that as Steam preventing me from closing itself, saying it was waiting for Black Mesa to close.

Fired up Process Explorer and saved a minidump which is attached. Was completely unable to suspend or kill the exe, or even Steam itself, got the message Access is denied - and yes I was running PE as Administrator.

Haven&#39;t tried to reproduce issue, this is the first and only time.
Resolved issue by logging off my Windows account and logging on again.
No crashes or dumps in the Steam folder appeared.
