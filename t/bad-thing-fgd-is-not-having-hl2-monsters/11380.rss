    <title>bad thing : fgd is not having hl2 monsters</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bad-thing-fgd-is-not-having-hl2-monsters/11380</link>
    <description>while i was replaying the game , i suddenly said to myself at the end of office [ before the jump in the elevator cage] that a fast zombie or two could make a good effect of surprise ...
then reminding the hl2 monsters , the antlions could be very good in maps where player fight a chopper [ that should be &#39;going to some random place to break the wall&#39; and stay near the impact zone ] as seen in hl2 before prison .
they could be coming from station exploded by jets , that can be a place where we see a scripted sequence . eyes following the plane , the the bombs and first thousands of antlions escaping the place  

after i had a look at the fgd and saw these monsters are not used ..may be you should add them in the fgd , at least in the coop mode they can be useful to spice the game , they are good enough to be added to your remodeled like they are [without the zombine but its a.i. can be good to have later] and loading them &quot;costs&quot; nothing .
i wonder how can look a gunship-drived by a vortigaunt ;&#39;]</description>

            <p>all hl2 npc do not have to be used in bm , some of them should be good like a lot posters wrote . we all play a lot of games and some souvenirs are mixing them together , like mixing hl2 and hl1 monsters in a map ;’]<br>
the most terrible is a poison headcrab with 2 or 3 fast ones , the first reducing the health few seconds while the others are killing you ;’]…<br>
i wonder how will look hl3 but like hl2 it will have a mix of old enemies and new one …<br>
may be some being so cool , that , a bms update will add some of the new monsters to the fgd ; at leat that the spirit i see the adding of monsters .<br>
[ on something else but very close : some l4d/2 cars could be cool to insert too ]</p>

<p>Hmm, you’re right, the US military version of a rollermine would just blow up on contact!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Still, I love the little buggers… it’s like the Lambda team decided to make Snarks twelve times deadlier. Without the gravity gun or a large cliff present, they could have been added in these rumored BM co-op games to keep players from idling too long in one place.</p>
<p>I think rollermines would have been right at home outside of the houndeye pen of Questionable Ethics.</p>

<p>Literally the only thing in HL2 that wasn’t in HL1 that could potentially be justifiably used in Black Mesa is the antlions, which nobody would miss anyway.<br>
[COLOR=‘Black’]I have it on good authority that they’re also normally fairy docile creatures, except during mating season.<br>
There will be no gunships, no humanoid combine soldiers, no rollermines in OAR, because it <span class="bbcode-i">wouldn’t make sense</span>. Especially the overwatch soldiers.<br>
I could see where stuff like this would fit in a seven hour war mod, but not in BM.</p>

<p>the hl2 alien_monsters are useable in bm , at least they are the evolutions of hl1 zombies , bm being an hl2 mod mixing very well the two hl . i would not say that is a crime to see fast headcrabs . at the time of hl , opposing - force or others mods were creating a lot of new monsters .<br>
hl2 engine is very hard for monsters creations because they need a lot of points and details . by now , games are using lasers to create shapes of models , then actors and cameras to make their movements …<br>
sadly bm team is not able of doing such works , may be soon with prices dropping like with these dudes using 4 or 6 cameras <a href="https://www.ipisoft.com/sales.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.ipisoft.com/sales.php</a></p>
<p>hl2 combine are mostly like grunts so they are less useable  , may be in a place like an other lab or even on xen</p>

<p>rollermines are nice and they could be good in game like in the rail part , being some sort of drones patrol<br>
fgd is cool to see how entities can be edited in hammer or in the bsp<br>
some change like slowing the twice “3 hammers” [ at the residue part ] can be made ; i can only pass them using god mode .</p>

<p>may be they deleted it to gain some stability with their dlls and next release will have them back , at least for some few aliens<br>
that could help to spice the action and surprise again</p>

            <p>I dunno. They completely removed the gravity gun; I wouldn’t be surprised if they did away with the HL2 ai as well, if only for the sake of clutter reduction.</p>

            <p>The FGD is just a text file. I’m not sure if the mod preserves HL2 entities within its DLLs… I’ll try spawning a rollermine next time I boot it up. I love rollermines.</p>

            <p>The reason that those enemies aren’t in Black Mesa is because they weren’t in Half-Life.  Simple as that.  It should stay that way, IMO.</p>

            <p>I suggest you use Gmod or add it by yourself.<br>
Though the HL2.fgd file is in the BMS folder so I don’t really understand the point of this.</p>

            <p>while i was replaying the game , i suddenly said to myself at the end of office [ before the jump in the elevator cage] that a fast zombie or two could make a good effect of surprise …<br>
then reminding the hl2 monsters , the antlions could be very good in maps where player fight a chopper [ that should be ‘going to some random place to break the wall’ and stay near the impact zone ] as seen in hl2 before prison .<br>
they could be coming from station exploded by jets , that can be a place where we see a scripted sequence . eyes following the plane , the the bombs and first thousands of antlions escaping the place</p>
<p>after i had a look at the fgd and saw these monsters are not used …may be you should add them in the fgd , at least in the coop mode they can be useful to spice the game , they are good enough to be added to your remodeled like they are [without the zombine but its a.i. can be good to have later] and loading them “costs” nothing .<br>
i wonder how can look a gunship-drived by a vortigaunt ;’]</p>
