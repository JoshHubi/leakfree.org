    <title>Mouse Drivers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/mouse-drivers/6454</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve got this mouse that is 7 years old now that I rather like.  Its an Aopen O-35G

[img]https://www.pacificgeek.com/productimages/xl/SIL-O-35G-2.jpg[/img]

As you can see it has 2 scroll wheels.  Now without drivers the mouse is full functional except the second wheel is simply  an inverted scroll direction. However with drivers it is a horizontal scroll.  I would very much like to enable this and have the drivers.  However the drivers do not support Windows 7 and no amount of compatibility mode seems to save it.

This brings me to the actual question, do you know of any custom drivers to like manipulate the control of my mouse or way of working around non-supported drivers?</description>

            <p>You said that you have Windows 7. If it is the 64 bit version there is not much hope of fixing it so that it will work. However if you have the 32 bit verison it might still work. I’ve read that someone was able to make it work using the R3.32 version drivers (with a reboot after installing). It’s worth a shot, I guess. The link below is to the R3.32 version drivers.</p>

            <p>I like those buttons <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=9" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"> and they buttons work without drivers  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> …  Also its a USB but it came with a USB to PS/2 adapter.</p>
<p>Not sure if you bring up the buttons means you think I am wrong about scrolling but the dual scrolls works as described with drivers, I have used it on my old XP machine that I no longer have.</p>

            <p>I stole a mouse exactly like that from an internet cafe in 2004. It has the ps/2 connector if I’m not mistaken, also the buttons are for back/forward and you could use microsoft intellipoint software, never tried it because I hated that mouse mostly due to those buttons.</p>
<p>edit: also the 2 scroll wheels are for scrolling slower or faster and it’s not reprogrammable IIRC.</p>

<p>Well that is a valid option, I’m not going to do it just for a scroll. Also I have one game that won’t run on xp  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
