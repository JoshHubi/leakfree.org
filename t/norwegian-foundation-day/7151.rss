    <title>Norwegian foundation day.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/norwegian-foundation-day/7151</link>
    <description>Today (the 17th of May) is basically like 4th of July to Americans. 

Except instead of shooting fireworks at the sky at night, every single children school creates a giant &quot;train&quot; of people with a Corps (which I hope google translate isn&#39;t joking with me to translate) behind them, gathering people more people as they go. Everyone is singing, blowing in annoying plastic whistles and yelling &quot;Hurra!&quot; and &quot;Gratulerer med dagen&quot;. This happens from 7am to about 11 - 12am.

After that they meet and eat hot dogs and ice cream. After a successful attempt on waking everyone up early in the morning on a holiday.

Discuss this &quot;magnificent&quot; day if you care.</description>

<p>To my knowledge that would be a different country. But one should always be on a lookout for racist elves.</p>
<p>Oh, and grats to us.</p>
