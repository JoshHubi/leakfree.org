    <title>Game crashed, unable to load autosave :(</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashed-unable-to-load-autosave/9685</link>
    <description>I was playing Black Mesa on the last chapter (14) when the game suddenly freezed. Now I&#39;m unable to load autosave files. I was on the last chapter so it makes me feel kind of sad really. The loading screen comes up but the game hangs at the last &quot;loading dot&quot;. I&#39;ve reinstalled the game once so don&#39;t suggest that  :slight_smile: 

Anyone got any suggestion or possible fixes?</description>
