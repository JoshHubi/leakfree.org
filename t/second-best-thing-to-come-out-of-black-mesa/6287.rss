    <title>Second Best Thing to Come Out of Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/second-best-thing-to-come-out-of-black-mesa/6287</link>
    <description>If you are a hopless romantic like myself, check out the 1936 film The Petrified Forest. The story takes place at a gas station in Black Mesa. However, this Black Mesa is in Arizona. Still, it&#39;s quite a trip to see people in a black &amp; white movie saying it repeatedly. Worth a watch if you&#39;re into this sort of thing.</description>
