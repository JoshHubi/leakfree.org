    <title>Laptop Issue with Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/laptop-issue-with-games/9125</link>
    <description>Hi  :slight_smile: 

First I know that most of the laptops are not appropriate for gaming or heavy video tasks but I&#39;ve received this laptop (Acer Aspire 5738ZG) some time ago. And it did well in the games that I played (Orange Box games before the engine update for HL2).

But for quite some time it doesn&#39;t play any game that well or at least for a good amount of time. The first time I noticed that issue was with TF2. I could play 5/10 minutes very well then had terrible FPS drops down to 9 and maintained at that value for 10 seconds then raised up again and down for 9 FPS making it unplayable.

It happens with other games too for example Minecraft. Started the game with high FPS and then the story repeats.

I have updated all the drivers, BIOS. I used Avast but switched for MSE for testing (and because it was giving away false positives for Steam).

My laptop is an Acer Aspire 5738ZG
CPU: Intel Pentium Dual-Core T4300, 2.10Ghz
RAM: 4GB DDR3
GPU: Nvidia G105M (Up to 1791 TurboCache - don&#39;t know if I need to activate some kind of option or it is on by default)
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with Service Pack 1

The thing is I know that the laptop is capable of playing those games because for 5/10 minutes they run pretty well (not on max settings of course).

Also disabled the write caching in Disk to see if it was a disk problem and it wasn&#39;t. Disabled all non-Windows services and restarted - same results; disabled all startup programs - same results.

Nvidia settings are set for performance.

Then I ran a test with SpeedFan to see the temperatures while idle and playing and I think it is not good (but maybe it was always like this):

Desktop + Web + Music:
GPU: 75ºC
HD : 55ºC
Core1: 70ºC
Core2: 71ºC (usually one degree higher)

Gaming:
GPU: 107ºC (ouch!)
HD : doesn&#39;t change much
Core1 and Core2: 85ºC-90ºC

Consulted the manuals to open up to the Fan and it is really hard. I mean... I have to remove all the devices within the PC because there is no direct access to it.

Any suggestions here? Are those temperatures normal for a laptop gaming? Is that the cause for those FPS drops?

Also my brother has the same laptop and I tested with the same game and the temperature reading was only between 0ºC-5ºC difference from mine.

Thanks.</description>

            <p>Yes I think it is fixed for now. I will try to clean it more often now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . The GPU now stands at 70ºC/80ºC while in gaming and the CPU stays at 70ºC too. Browsing + Steam + Music they stay at 39ºC/40ºC</p>

            <p>Seems like it’s fixed for now, anyway most (99.9%) of laptops don’t have replaceable graphics cards, all the components are soldered onto the main board.</p>

            <p>Your laptops is overheating when it playes games. I had the same problem with an old desktop. 107 degrees is extremely high for a gpu and I wouldn’t be surprised if the laptop crashed. The only way to fix this issue is to lower that gpu temperature (on the graphics card). Either with a laptop cooler pad, which still may not fix the issue, or new fans. I’d highly recommend having someone experienced install maybe a new graphics card or new fan inside. Laptops are vastly more complicated to take apart than a desktop. Good luck  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>After cleaning up my PC the temperature of the CPU dropped 40°C and of the GPU 30°C. Not tested while in game but it sure is a big drop  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>the most important is knowing which screw goes where, I usually print a picture of the back of the laptop and place screws on the paper according to where they should go</p>
<p>then I go to get a snack and my little sister re arranges all the screws and mixes them with screws that aren’t even from the laptop :fffuuu:</p>

<p>I’ve searched for your specific laptop model and Google says use SmartFan or <a href="https://www.computentsystems.de/aceraspireonefancontrol/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this app</a>. I don’t have an Acer laptop so I can’t confirm that it will work.</p>

<p>How old is this laptop?  It could just be age and the parts finally giving up.  It happens.  Laptops aren’t meant to last too long in the first place.  I’d say about 2-3 years minimum, 4-5 tops.  I know you probably don’t want to hear this but I would heavily consider buying a new PC.  Or, even better, build one since you can save some money.</p>
<p>I know the CPU temp is fine for a desktop, but not sure about a laptop.  I would assume so unless it’s like an ultra book or something.  And yeah, I think your GPU is or may soon, or already be FUBAR.</p>

<p>Yes maybe 3/4 years old. Yeah never liked laptops for these kind of tasks and I know that I have to replace it. Or at least buy a new PC as you suggested (no laptop). I’m currently on an Computer Science course and this is definitely a need. I’ve to make some money for a big PC asap.</p>

<p>Your brother’s laptop also needs a clean up then, because 105C+ is really just a wall beyond which your CPU and GPU are underclocked until temperature is brought down by the cooling system.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes I’ll do that. I’m going to buy some thermal paste and a can of compressed air. The tech manual said that I had to remove a lot of stuff to reach the fans and by a lot of stuff I mean almost all of the components. There is direct access to the RAMS and to the Hard Disk but not for the fans.</p>
<p>What software do you recommend for controlling the speed of the fans?</p>

<p>Hey man, I had the EXACT same issue with my laptop few months ago too, I couldn’t even play Minecraft on lowest settings it would block and the fps would go down drastically. I tolerated this for 6 months, and I told my dad to take the laptop to a Laptop Service thingy, and it cleaned my laptop and now it runs just as good as before! My laptop is 2 years now, and it’s still in perfect condition.</p>
<p>Also, if/after you clean it, I recommend you buying a cooling pad for a laptop, it isn’t expensive, I have one it costed me around 20-30$ or so.</p>
<p>Hope you get your laptop fixed man, for 6 months I was damn desperate to find a solution, until I thought it’s overheating, my laptop had 88C in idle, and over 100 in gaming too.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you, don’t wait like I did, cause if you let it like this for more than a year, the system can get damaged, even burn inside, literally.</p>

<p>Glad it works now  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> . Yes I’ve to clean it urgently before it gets burned and I’m left over with no laptop  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  At first thought that it might have been the antivirus scanning periodically for some game files slowing down the game performance but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Do you know what are the regular temperatures in laptops for the CPU and GPU? Just to have some reference.</p>

<p>Yes. Going to do that. Will see if I’ve a laptop cooler around here to and try  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <title>Laptop Issue with Games</title>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>First I know that most of the laptops are not appropriate for gaming or heavy video tasks but I’ve received this laptop (Acer Aspire 5738ZG) some time ago. And it did well in the games that I played (Orange Box games before the engine update for HL2).</p>
<p>But for quite some time it doesn’t play any game that well or at least for a good amount of time. The first time I noticed that issue was with TF2. I could play 5/10 minutes very well then had terrible FPS drops down to 9 and maintained at that value for 10 seconds then raised up again and down for 9 FPS making it unplayable.</p>
<p>It happens with other games too for example Minecraft. Started the game with high FPS and then the story repeats.</p>
<p>I have updated all the drivers, BIOS. I used Avast but switched for MSE for testing (and because it was giving away false positives for Steam).</p>
<p>My laptop is an Acer Aspire 5738ZG<br>
CPU: Intel Pentium Dual-Core T4300, 2.10Ghz<br>
RAM: 4GB DDR3<br>
GPU: Nvidia G105M (Up to 1791 TurboCache - don’t know if I need to activate some kind of option or it is on by default)<br>
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with Service Pack 1</p>
<p>The thing is I know that the laptop is capable of playing those games because for 5/10 minutes they run pretty well (not on max settings of course).</p>
<p>Also disabled the write caching in Disk to see if it was a disk problem and it wasn’t. Disabled all non-Windows services and restarted - same results; disabled all startup programs - same results.</p>
<p>Nvidia settings are set for performance.</p>
<p>Then I ran a test with SpeedFan to see the temperatures while idle and playing and I think it is not good (but maybe it was always like this):</p>
<p>Desktop + Web + Music:<br>
GPU: 75ºC<br>
HD : 55ºC<br>
Core1: 70ºC<br>
Core2: 71ºC (usually one degree higher)</p>
<p>Gaming:<br>
GPU: 107ºC (ouch!)<br>
HD : doesn’t change much<br>
Core1 and Core2: 85ºC-90ºC</p>
<p>Consulted the manuals to open up to the Fan and it is really hard. I mean… I have to remove all the devices within the PC because there is no direct access to it.</p>
<p>Any suggestions here? Are those temperatures normal for a laptop gaming? Is that the cause for those FPS drops?</p>
<p>Also my brother has the same laptop and I tested with the same game and the temperature reading was only between 0ºC-5ºC difference from mine.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
