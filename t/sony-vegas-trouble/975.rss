    <description>I was recently trying to edit some video&#39;s in Sony Vegas. I saved all the edited clips as a vegas file then later tried to open them.
I got this error message;

&#39;The following File Could not be found in the specified location&#39;

Then the clip was a blank...can anyone explain this?</description>

            <p>Thanks, I figured it out last night.</p>
<p>I moved the video files that I edited into a seperate folder.</p>

            <p>When you put a video in Sony Vegas, it doesn’t copy the actual videofile and stores it somewhere safe.<br>
This means if you replace the original file to somewhere else, Vegas won’t be able to find it and you get that error.</p>
<p>If you know where you put the file simply browse for it (it will give you this option when you get the error).</p>
<p>Next time I suggest you make a folder for your video, put all the files you are going to use in there and never move them to prevent these errors.</p>
