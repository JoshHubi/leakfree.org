    <title>Post Release Plugins</title>

    <description>After the initial release of the game, maybe the developers can release little optionally downloadable packs of content for the game, and not actually working on them during initial development. I have some ideas for some myself. REMEMBER: I am not demanding that the devs do this, but it is a SUGGESTION.

*[b]Sharpshooter pack[/b]*
For people who liked the HD weapons for the original Half-Life. It replaces all of the current weapons with the ones in the original HD pack except for the weapons that remain unchanged except for higher poly (if it&#39;s hard to understand, it means like replace the Glock with the Beretta, the SPAS-12 sawed-off with SPAS-12 with the stock folded, the MP5 with the M4, etc.)

*[b]Filmmaker kit[/b]*
access to the TF2 replay editor, for the people making a Half-Life/ Black Mesa movie. I, for one, am one of those people. It should also add a 3rd person view of Gordon with many realistic 3rd person animations.

*[b]Smart Moving Pack[/b]
should add a whole bunch of first person animations, picking up items similar to in L4D, scripted animations, all inspired by this video: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtIp8jOo8_o&amp;feature=player_embedded[/url]</description>

<blockquote>
<p>At this time in development, it would just be another hindrance in the completion of BM to include the M4. I for one think the MP5 is great.</p>
<p>EDIT: And also, since the M4 does not use the same ammo as the MP5 would not make sense since the Glock shares ammo with the MP5.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m pretty sure he means possible mods for the mod after release, and not more shit for the devs to do.</p>

            <p>I’m not new, and I know the M4 was going to be an option. I don’t see why it still can’t be. Besides, sometimes I ask hypothetical questions that do not even apply to me, just for the benefit of others (We had a test in science before school ended, the teacher said we needed a <span class="hashtag">#2</span> pencil. I had one, but I still asked what would happen if someone didn’t have one.)<br>
By the way, I am not new here, just to the forum. As a matter of fact, whenever I hit the random page button on the wiki, it brings me to a page I have already seen. and I hit that button alot. :jizz:</p>
