    <title>Why can&#39;t I jump high enough???</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-cant-i-jump-high-enough/11641</link>
    <description>I have been  in several situations where I simply can&#39;t jump high enough to complete the current puzzle. I am simply at an impasse right now at the large bridge that is out because I can&#39;t jump up on the pipes to cross along the wall. It is as if I can only jump about 6 inches.  I can&#39;t go any further in the game.

I watch the YouTube videos and people are having no problem at all jumping up on things.  Do I have something set wrong?  I switched from normal to easy to no effect.

Any help appreciated!</description>

            <p>Learn to crouch-jump… If you modify the jump values in the cfg, you will probably have some problem in other maps such as the one with all those tripwire mines  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I found the answer in another thread:</p>
<p>" i found the answer in cheack first thread i have edited the skill.cfg file jump value too “250” instead of “150”, it now works fine thanks for your reply anyways. "</p>
<p>I saw several jump config options so I just about doubled each value in the Game Play section of the config file.  Now I can actually play the game. Seriously, that is a huge bug IMHO.  The way the game came out-of-the-box was completely unplayable.</p>
<p>Perhaps there should be a jump slider-bar in the menu system under options.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s all good now.<br>
Cheers!</p>

<p>you have to “ctrl+space” jump and sometimes “shift+ctrl+space” jump</p>

</aside>
<p>Those keys do work a little, and can help. But I still can’t jump around like everyone else. The video below shows a first time player just hop up on things with no problem. He crosses the pipes around the bridge in about 10 seconds.  I am stuck halfway through the bridge puzzle because I can’t jump up on the pipes.</p>
<p>I may have to give up on the game unless I figure out what is wrong. It is unplayable as it is.</p>
