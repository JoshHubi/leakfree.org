Hm.

A Wolfenstein reboot, perhaps? I&#39;m not sure we really need that.</description>

            <p>Same. Not every game has to be a powerhouse that maxes out one neckbeard’s $10K gaming computer.</p>
<p>That being said I’ll be pretty disappointed if the game is on the technical par Portal 2/ Dota 2. It’s not enough for the next Half Life. I’ll accept at the very least a Gears of War 3 technical quality in terms of features and not hardware specific qualities like resolution and shit.</p>
<p>Also, I liked Rage and no one else did. I had an Nvidia card and no one else did lol. Now that I have an ATI card and the game’s patched up, I’m having just as much fun as I was Day 1. The AI is responsive as fuck, the in-combat animations are amazing and blend so seamlessly that I feel like there’s a time traveling animator that just animates the bad guys as I’m playing. The alternate ammo types are cool, the guns sound fucking awesome (not realistic but very satisfying, especially that potatogun-esque shot gun) the actual quality of the assets are fucking awesome, the world is designed with an unparalleled finesse, and the story sucks but who the fuck cares. Yeah, the megatextures fucking up the overall world’s texture density is bleh but come the hell on. We all fucking know it wasn’t about packing pixels when we first saw the tech rear its head. It was about <span class="bbcode-i">variation.</span> Holy fuck does Rage have that. Besides a few reoccuring stamps, which in this game is like pointing out a few similar looking brush strokes in an oil painting the size of a football field, every square inch of every fucking environment is unique.</p>
<p>I appreciate the hell out of rage. I love it for what it is. I know it’s not a flawless game and I understand all the criticism against it, but fuck. I knew what I wanted and I got it.</p>
<p>… Why are we talking about this? This is about the new horror game.<br>
is this running in the Skyrim engine? It kinda looks like it.</p>

            <p>It takes about the same time for Valve and Id Software to release a game, the difference is, once Valve releases something late, it’s not outdated by the time it comes out. While guys at Id are late with everything and it shows, what was their last AAA quality game anyway? Oh wait, Doom 3, and its quality is arguable, it was quite good back in its day, but HL2 came as superior.<br>
Haven’t played Rage yet, but it didn’t succeed I guess.<br>
And we know that Doom 4 is in troubles. Not saying they are bad devs, sure there are some talented folks and publishers are more than likely responsible too, just saying that Id isn’t the point of interest anymore.</p>
<p>But we can try guessing two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>which is gonna be releases as first</li>
<li>which is going to suck</li>
</ul>

            <p>So it is indeed Shinji Mikami’s project. It’s called The Evil Within and <a href="https://uk.ign.com/videos/2013/04/19/the-evil-within-debut-trailer-1080p" data-bbcode="true">here’s a live action teaser trailer</a>.</p>
<p>It’s like if the Ring’s VHS footage and Hostel had a baby.</p>

<p>I hope it’s a game that goes back to the survival horror roots of RE while doing something new and fresh with it.</p>

<p>I would like to see some info on Doom 4</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In April of 2013, Kotaku published an article describing Doom 4 as trapped in “development hell”. Citing connections to id, the article claims that Doom 4 has suffered under mismanagement, and that development was completely restarted in 2011. Inside sources described the pre-2011 version, which was to portray the uprising of hell on Earth, as heavily scripted and cinematic, comparing it to the Call of Duty franchise. The pre-2011 version was criticized as mediocre, but the sources also described the new version as “lame” and a “mess”.</p>
<p>Happy now?</p>
