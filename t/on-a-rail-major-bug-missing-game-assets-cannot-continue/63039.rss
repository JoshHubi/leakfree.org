    <title>On A Rail - Major Bug - Missing Game Assets - Cannot Continue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-major-bug-missing-game-assets-cannot-continue/63039</link>
    <description>There is a missing control panel and walkway over the water.  This is stopping me from completing the level.  I have verified game files and deleted and re-installed the game.  Not sure WTF is going on...

            <p>Thanks, and sorry about that.  I watched several walkthroughs on YouTube for earlier releases of the game and they showed the console and platform above the water (where the wire is currently plugged into the wall).  I thought for some reason these didn’t load.</p>
<p>With that said I am sort of stuck… Anyone have any hints for me to be able to move on?  I thought I had to grab the plug from the wall above the water but without the platform I am unable to do so.</p>

            <p>Nothing is missing there, the puzzle was modified to remove the console because it was effectively completely redundant. That is how it should look!</p>
