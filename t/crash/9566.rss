    <description>Trying to run BMS on OS X 10.8.1 with Wine 1.5.11 + XQuartz. The Source SDK Base 2007 stress test works just fine without crashes, BMS appears to work quite fine too, however after several minutes of playing the game simply freezes and crashes to desktop; as the stress test works fine, this should not be related to the OS or anything. Attached the segfault dump. Tried common stuff like disabling the Steam overlay, didn&#39;t help. Unfortunately I can&#39;t look at the backtrace myself as I don&#39;t have the tools for windows debugging.
