    <title>[Minor Issue] Huge FPS drop during &quot;We&#39;ve got hostiles&quot; and the Osprey standoff</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minor-issue-huge-fps-drop-during-weve-got-hostiles-and-the-osprey-standoff/10424</link>
    <description>In the chapter &quot;we&#39;ve got hostiles&quot; after you dodge the artillery and run inside a small bunker you find yourself at a stand off with some marines being dropped from an osprey. Been awhile since I played HL and I forgot that you are supposed to run down the shaft and enter a vent to continue the game. I just kept fighting off the marines as they seemed to be infinitely dropped. I run the game on mid/high settings at about 60 fps but around the 4th marine drop, the fps drops to a constant 4. When I figured out where to go I reloaded to a previous spot and just ran right through that area with no FPS drop at all. So, it&#39;s not a big issue, but maybe the reason why there was such a huge lag spike could be the same reason other areas get lag spikes. I dunno, thought this might help.</description>
