    <title>The Perfect Boss Fight</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-perfect-boss-fight/3048</link>
    <description>So I just finished Mass Effect 2, and loved it for the most part, but the final boss got me thinking about how to pull of a boss battle in an FPS/TPS. So I pose the question to you: What makes a good boss battle and what, for you, would be your perfect boss battle, if you think they should even exist.

For me, I think that boss battles, in FPSs at least, are a thing of the past. In a less sophisticated time when enemies were 2D and games were [i]substantially[/i] worse than Crysis, simplistic boss battles fit in with the simplistic nature of the game. Today however, I feel like boss battles are just tedious, and as a result often anticlimactic, as you just pour bullet after bullet into some overpowered monster.
I personally prefer, as with so many gaming concepts, the Half-Life 2 approach. Its finale accomplished both things that a finale should do. It:
A ) Provided an exciting conclusion as you rose through the citadel in a race against Breen.
B ) Showed a clear defeat over the antagonist.

So thats my view. Feel free to contribute, retort, agree, mock, or troll to your hearts desire.</description>

            <p>I’m just asking whether you think there is a place for boss battles in the modern FPS, and if so what would your personal preference be and if not, then what would you like to see instead.</p>

            <p>That in itself brings an entirely new aspect to discuss: should we consider Boss Battles to only include Boss Enemies, or should we also include Boss EVENTS?</p>

            <p>Okay, its just that we were getting into 2D, which is an entirely different situation than 3D, and I wanted at the very least to stay in the third dimension. Half Life 2 and its episodes didn’t really have a boss fight though, more a finale.</p>

            <p>Exactly, so looking back we’ve manged to come up with games that had good boss fights:</p>
<p>Valve (Half Life, Half Life 2, Episodes, Portal, etc)<br>
Zelda<br>
Psychonauts<br>
Shadows of the Colosus<br>
God of War<br>
Devil May Cry<br>
Darksiders<br>
Resident Evil 4</p>
<p>And the general consensus so far basically sums up to being that the best boss fights are usually self contained puzzles that try to kill you as you solve them.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but it still ends up coming cross like someone making a topic like:</p>
<p>“I hate Jews!”</p>
<p>but then in the opening post you’re like “I know this one guy, who’s jewish, and he’s a real asshole. I hate him so much.”</p>
<p>It’s not really about you hating jews, it’s just about you hating one guy and then being stupid about it.</p>

            <p>I’d say that a good boss fight should involve as many different skills that you learned in earlier parts of the game as possible. The GLaDOS and Nihilanth fights both attempt this but don’t quite manage it. Mainly because it should also be the hardest part so that you have a true feeling of accomplishment.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are boss fights that wouldn’t translate well into FPS, but those usually aren’t GOOD boss fights.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not really. Turn-based boss fights, for example, are usually just pouring on damage, which would not translate well. Games with sword play mechanics often do not stand up to shooting, since its a much longer range deal.</p>
<p>EDIT: Plus people were getting into 2D games. Those just don’t work.</p>

            <p>I just think a simple fun boss fight makes you use your brain. I always liked boss fights when you had to use the environment to kill or defeat the boss. Kind of like falling boulders or having them run into the wall.</p>

            <p>Agreed. The gameplay might not be the same but the general concept of a boss “scenario” over a boss “battle” between the different genres are going to have a lot in common such as the amount of thinking involved in the fight, how much moving around must be done, and if there is a large battle arena or a standard straight little area where you run back and forth shooting a whole bunch.</p>

<p>When it comes to boss fights, there is a basic core that comprises good boss fights from any genre. The other games are going to get brought in because they have that core and would make for good boss battles even if they were FPS.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are boss fights that wouldn’t translate well into FPS, but those usually aren’t GOOD boss fights.</p>

<p>if anyone’s played DMC4, I think that had the best bosses ever… in fact the whole devil may cry series has had great bosses. They’re actually really satisfying when you finish them off as opposed to that stupid great crysis tac cannon fight atrocity.<br>
To be honest I think bosses only really work in more arcade style/ 3rd person fighting games. Then again, RE4 had some of the best boss fights ever…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I vehemently disagree! DMC2 had the most annoying final boss ever. I had to beat him with a single small heal, and nothing but guns (I never upgraded my swords, and he did so much damage that I couldn’t get close to him safely), it took me hours! The DMC series really did not go easily on those who preferred ranged combat over close up. That said, the bosses were amazing, just unbalanced.</p>
<p>My favorite bosses were in Okami and Metroid. They never seemed impossible, just very, very challenging.</p>

            <p>Zelda always had great bosses, especially Ocarina of Time.<br>
I also liked the bosses from the Metal Gear Solid and God of War series.<br>
Resident Evil 4 and 5 had awesome bosses, too.</p>
<p>Bosses have to be massive and epic. The bigger, the better  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .<br>
I don’t like it if they’re only strong enemies with many HP. They have to be special in their abilities and weaknesses.</p>

            <p>As said, it’s more of a boss scenario, or puzzle.  I like platforming (or perhaps just running through a large area, but jumping’s always a plus!) around trying to do something that will THEN kill the boss.  Just shooting at a single enemy for an extended period of time just feels kinda boring.</p>
<p>For example, the Crysis final boss battle, when you got out onto the deck, they could have made it better by making you, maybe, have to go through some wreckage to find some sort of mounted artillery gun to use, then it’d be destroyed, then you’d have to climb/run your way to another, and so on, until it was dead.  But no, they had you just sitting there, shooting it, at the mercy of it’s tentacle-rape move.  I hated just shooting at it hiding behind the wreckage of something or another the entire battle.  Sometimes it would just randomly make you dead without doing anything.</p>
<p>EDIT: That scenario was regarding the pre-final-boss battle.  The final boss battle was…  a stationary fight.  They couldn’t have made it any less good or and more bad.</p>
<p>EDIT: Any less good or any better.</p>
<p>EDIT: Crysis fucked up @ FPS.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/patonki">@Patonki</a>:  I think he’s saying that the Gunships coming through to make a distraction was the only “average” part of the ending, in comparison to other games, and that the rest of it was awesome.</p>
