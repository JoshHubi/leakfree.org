    <title>Registering my account: Human Verification Issues</title>

    <description>Where this I assume a &quot;captcha&quot; to type, all there is an advertisement.  In this case it&#39;s for Dish&#39;s Hopper service.  It forced me to use the audio version which is hard to understand, even for me.  It took me 4-5 tries before it finally said I got it right.  Just thought I&#39;d mention it as I have another in-game bug to report, but almost said screw it because of the registration issues.</description>
