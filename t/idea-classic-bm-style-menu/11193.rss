    <title>[idea] Classic BM-style menu?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/idea-classic-bm-style-menu/11193</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just curious, would it be possible for someone to animate the Black Mesa title in the same way that the HL WON menu displayed the game title, and turn that into a texture? - and then create a background map that has the camera in front of a brush using that texture, to create the illusion of a 1998 HL1-styled menu?

Given the time I could probably make the animated texture, though I&#39;m not sure how I would get in game to do this.</description>

            <p>Trying to round those edges turned out to be a complete fucking pain in the ass and it looked like shit. So I abandoned it and settled with just cutting off the faces from the edges. I also made normal, specular, bump and diffuse maps. Not nearly all of them are in use, just normal and base texture. To be honest, I´m not sure how to make use of them. I also started <a href="https://youtu.be/193MPRKZcws" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">playing around with lights.</a> Now, the texture behind bm logo is just a placeholder, I was thinking of creating animated texture and make it so that it´s not affected by surrounding lights. What do you think? Too dark? Too colorful? Too bad? As usual, suggestions and constructive criticism are welcome!</p>

            <p>Doesn’t look like it’s func_detailed (the color isn’t green in hammer).<br>
Func_detail it, it may be a small map but func_detail and you’ll get a real boost in compile time.</p>
<p>Also that manifest window, drag it out and kill it! You don’t need it.</p>

            <p>I did it! I ditched that arch and just used the clipping tool after I finally got the hold of it. I may have gone overboard by increasing the wall size to 1024x1024 but I wanted make sure I had enough room to work with. I think it turned good, better than I expected. Now I just need to round the edges and I can proceed to texturing and lighting.<br>

            <p>I’d just increase it as much as needed to ensure the vertices fit on grid while still conforming to the curvature of the logo. Looking at your screenshot again, I’d say what you have now should be fine as long as the arch is on grid.<br>
You probably don’t need a new background texture, but you’ll need to remove the <font face="Consolas, Courier New, Courier, monospace">$selfillum 1</font> parameter from your vmt, and possibly remove the black mesa logo from the texture once you finish making the brushwork cuts, if you do decide you’re going to go that route. Otherwise, you <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> end up having parts of the logo ‘bleed’ onto your background material.</p>
<p>If you just want the logo to be a separate material instead of something that’s definitely 3D, you could also look into making an animated texture that uses a Black Mesa logo in the alpha channel and the <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/%24translucent" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">$translucent</a> parameter, then putting that on a func_detail brush face a unit (or even 0.5 units if you use the scale and translate functions in the right-click context menu) closer to the camera than the background.</p>

</aside>
<p>No, creating shadows over it wasn´t really what I was after. I did a little research on carving and internet told me to just leave it be.</p>
<p>So this is what I´m after: I want to me hole and round the edges. Then make another wall element behind it and paint with animated texture, so that it looks like the Black Mesa logo was just pressed there. That way I could create panning lights and stuff that would affect everything else but the logo.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Alright, so in order to make this work, how much I should increase that wall? What would you do? Also, Should I make entirely new background texture for those panning lights you suggested?</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips and ideas by the way, they are really helpful!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Hammer rule of thumb: every time you carve, a kitten dies.</p>
<p>I’d suggest doing it with displacements but 114 won’t do it, too small.</p>
<p>So you really don’t have any other option than modelling the wall - don’t, it’s a pain in the ass for Source.</p>
<p>So really, if anything, just have it as a blocklight to cast the logo as a shadow on the wall.</p>

<p>I was thinking you could have the screen occasionally being distorted, specifically as if an explosive landed nearby (you could even sync it up with certain notes from the background music, if there is any).</p>
<p>Another thought may be to include occasional green, silent flashes of light, from behind the camera, hinting at a portal opening. (Perhaps use some sort of shading trick to have the silhouette of Freeman briefly appear?)</p>
<p>Either way, just a few (probably bad) ideas I came up with. This <span class="bbcode-i">really </span>looks good, keep up the good work![/size]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There will be randomized steam distortions and sparks flying around. However, you have to remember that this image is very abstract, so having concrete things happening on it would be odd. Otherwise, I really liked that Freeman-silhouette idea  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It´s starting to look ok to me. Made it with Gimp and Lightroom, then I stuffed it in Hammer and this is where I am now. So, given the fact that this is NOT just an background pic, but an textured wall in an actual 3d map, I was thinking that I should take advantage of it. Like effects and so. I´d love to hear suggestions.<br>
