    <title>How do I modify weapon spread, recoil and damage?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-do-i-modify-weapon-spread-recoil-and-damage/12166</link>
    <description>Which files do I have to mod?

I decided to stop playing the game until I can get this done in order to improve the enjoyment I&#39;ll get out of the rest of the game. I want weapons that are currently, at least in my opinion, useless to become more viable.

The MP5 for instance, is one of the most frustrating weapons I&#39;ve ever used in a video game. Because of the instantaneous reactions of AI soldiers (they hit you the moment you stick your nose out), you need to counter them with weapons that are capable of instantaneous or at least very low time to kill.
You can insta-kill enemies with the shotgun, with the magnum, with the crossbow, with the laser and some others. 

The MP5, on the other hand, takes ages to kill at close range, and it gets exponentially worse with increasing range where its massive spread starts to have an effect. It is virtually impossible to kill an enemy soldier without taking loads of damage back. Seriously, when I compare TTK(time to kill) I can achieve with the Magnum to TTK I can achieve with the MP5, the difference between them is like a billion times. 
[b]Headshot with a magnum[/b] = [u]instantaneous kill[/u] vs. [u]several seconds[/u] of [b]spraying harmless bb&#39;s[/b]. The difference is infinite, I&#39;m not kidding.

I&#39;d like to mod the MP5 so that it has some kind of skill-based recoil that rewards headshots with higher damage modifier and decrease the spread on initial shots. If that sounds too much like Counter-Strike, then that&#39;s not quite what I have in mind. Anyway, it would be nice if somebody could tell me what I&#39;m supposed to edit.</description>

            <p>I think the SMG loses accuracy after 6+ rounds in a single burst. If you tap fire it, the game will think it’s burst firing even though it’ll seem automatic, so it won’t lose accuracy as quickly.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa weapons have static spread, the weapon’s accuracy does not change by running or crouching.</p>

            <p>Unless Black Mesa’s got a different system for it (which I kind of doubt), the recoil and accuracy are in the game’s coding.</p>

            <p>I don’t think you can change recoil or accuracy, or if you can I don’t know how.</p>
<p>You can change max ammo, damage, and pickup amount in the skill.cfg, and you can change the magazine size in and ammo type (why would you though?) in the Scripts folder.</p>

<p>Thanks. I see you can edit weapon damage in that file, but I don’t see any scripts for recoil and deviation.</p>
