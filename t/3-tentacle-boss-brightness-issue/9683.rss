    <title>3 Tentacle boss, brightness issue.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/3-tentacle-boss-brightness-issue/9683</link>
    <description>When entering the circular chamber with the 3 tentacle boss to kill it, the brightness gets set way too low. I noticed it when the room loaded walking through the airlock, and it stayed that way until I left the room by the bottom exit. 

To be able to navigate the room I had to turn the brightness all the way up in options, and once I exited the room the brightness reverted to normal levels.
