    <title>Zionism Palestinian-Israeli conflict</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/zionism-palestinian-israeli-conflict/2582</link>
    <description>So I thought we could discuss this middle eastern bloodbath.
I&#39;ll start the debate by saying that Israel should never have existed in the first place given the conditions of it&#39;s foundations- and that a great many territories should be Arab (Due to history and demographics, for instance- upon partition in 1948 the Jewish settlers owned less than a tenth of the land in Palestine- but were given 56% by the UN). Israel ensued illegal annexations in following wars. (Though now it&#39;s to late to completely revert.
Hamas though is as bad an entity, and both sides seem to have total disregard for civilian loss of life.
I also think our tax money shouldn&#39;t be spent on supporting such a state.
There is no reason why Jews and Arab-Muslims can&#39;t coexist peacefully in a same secular state, Zionism and to an extent the Islamist are to blame for the ongoing fighting.</description>

            <p>Lets take another Muslim in our world, say the CIA asset who turned double agent and blew himself up in Afghanistan. Also a Jordanian, incidentally. What made him switch from helping the CIA fight A-Q in Afghanistan to bombing them? People who know him say Gaza and civilian casualties from drone airstrikes in Pakistan.</p>
<p>I never said Israel was the “driving force behind Mideast violence” and “solving the provlem will make the world a happy place.” Try debating what I actually posted, if you want a discussion.<br>

            <p>So a Muslim on our forums says something and then that is what everyone thinks. Lets take another Muslim in our world, say the president of Iran (don’t make me spell it). He says he wants to wipe Israel of the map. One person on the internet is hardly enough to justify a claim that Israel is the driving force behind Mideast violence, and that the solving of that problem will make the world a happy place.</p>

            <p>We should drop a shitload of bombs along the border of Israel and shear off the land from the Middle Eastern Penninsula, creating an island that is no longer part of the mid east and can claim it for its own.</p>
<p>Genius.</p>

            <p>i think US aid should be pulled though. 60 years of military freebies is enough now. It’s not like Israel doesn’t have the funds to fight their own wars. the US as well as germany and other western countries should cut off their aid.</p>
<p>It’s also a little unrealistic to think that this problem will be solved so simply, these religious factions have been at war over their holy soil since their inceptions. Both sides seem to be doing what ever it takes to win, with no regard for human rights or civilian casualties. In turn, both religions are violating their creeds. In Islam, it is said that if you kill one Innocent, it’s like killing the whole world. In Judaism, God through Moses clearly states that murder is wrong. Ultimatally, we should have no part in their blood feud.</p>
<p>Maybe after a year of Foreign Aid cut-off, then the US, along with the UN can try to negotiate with both parties, but right now, peace talks only delay inevitable wars.</p>

</aside>
<p>The existence of an autonomous Palestinian state would be the most powerful blow to terrorist recruitment in recent history. Israel’s occupation of Gaza/Palestine is one of the most significant factors in radicalizing Muslims. Even our own mild-mannered forum Muslim, Shadi, says that good Muslims should fight against Israel because of Gaza.</p>

<p>We disagree, I believe if they stop the seige of Gaza and halt expansion into the occupied territories, that’s the first step towards comprehensive mideast peace.</p>

            <p>I question whether Hamas “would not stop until Israel is destroyed.” In fact their leadership has declared that they will recognize Israel if it withdraws to the '67 borders.</p>

            <p>I question whether returning the Palestinian’s land would bring even temporary peace. Groups like Hamas would not stop until Israel is destroyed, and they have a wide influence, and Israel’s close proximity to their bases of operation would mean that massive terrorist attacks would be much easier. Israel would just find itself fighting another, possibly more costly, war.</p>

            <p>Its the first step in solving the problem. You’re right that it’s an unwinnable war for either side, it’s only going to be solved by peaceful negotiation of an autonomous palestinian state brokered through third parties, and with heavy pressure on Israel from the US with our military aid on the line.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think Israel/Palestine are going to have a  Berlin Wall moment, and as an ethnic Jew I sincerely hope that the proverbial wall comes down after at least a decade of peaceful coexistance, rather than after another decade of this eye-for-an-eye violence.</p>

            <p>While I agree to an extent, that will by no means solve the problem. Ultimately this is an unwinable war, unless we see mass genocide of 7.5 million+ people.</p>
