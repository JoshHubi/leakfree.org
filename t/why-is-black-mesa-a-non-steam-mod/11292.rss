    <title>Why is Black Mesa a &quot;non-steam mod&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-is-black-mesa-a-non-steam-mod/11292</link>
    <description>Im wondering that Black Mesa is a non-steam game. In steam Library ist declared as a &quot;non-steam mod&quot;.

As far as i understand that means that it wont show my achiements, nor got any updates/patches via steam?

Why is that so? Isnt there some kind of cooperation since its using the source engine and stuff?</description>

            <p>Only games officially put onto Steam for purchase/download by Valve will support out-of-game achievement displays and automatic updates etc.  All Steam does is offer a convenienent, organised way to launch and play mods.</p>
<p>It’s not very different to when you add a non-Steam game you bought on a disc or downloaded from elsewhere to your library, just to have a shortcut and overlay functionality.</p>

            <p>It hasn’t been integrated with steam, so achievements will not be officially registered and they can’t update trough it yet. It has been greenlit but integration takes time.</p>

            <p>As far as I know, it was Greenlit and all… perhaps Steam doesn’t fully support it yet?</p>
