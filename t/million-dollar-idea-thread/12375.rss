    <description>Post inventions/ideas you&#39;ve had that you don&#39;t have the resources and/or knowledge to patent and produce.

Here&#39;s one I came up with recently that I really wish existed so I could use it:
It&#39;s a DSLR camera docking station for your smartphone. Basically you take a typical DSLR camera and remove almost all the buttons, screen and processing hardware. Then, in their place, you put a dock for a smartphone. You use the camera&#39;s lens and image sensing equipment to take the photos and then use the smartphone for processing and ui. The smartphone end of the operation is handled by a preferably open source app that allows you to access all the DSLR&#39;s settings like on any current DSLR camera.

That&#39;s the basic idea, but there&#39;s a few additions to make it better. For example, the docking station would just be a large rectangular inset big enough to fit most phones. You&#39;d then buy a 20-30 dollar case designed for your specific phone that would fit seamlessly into the rectangular inset on the DSLR. Also the DSLR dock could come with a typical DSLR camera&#39;s battery to give it extra life and help power all the camera stuff. You could give it bluetooth capability so that you could take group photos with the camera end on a tripod and the smartphone end in your hand where you can access settings, preview the shot, and take the shot (not sure how this would effect the image processing, may not be possible). If the earlier part is practical, you could make the tripod screwhole on the bottom of the camera attached to some servos so you could use your smartphone to pan back and forth to better position the shot.

Basically you&#39;d take the best of the DSLR cameras and combine it with the best of smartphones.</description>

</aside>
<p>I understand that it’s an argument of it could, I’m just arguing that it can’t, or at least it’s incredibly unlikely.</p>
<p>Gravity is something repeatedly tested and confirmed. It’s ability to affect across a distance is acknowledged. That’s rather different than taking something that we have no evidence for external connection and saying it might have an external connection for no other reason than that we don’t understand it and us people are so desperate to feel special that we need to think our consciousness is something special. There’s a big difference in the situations. For consciousness to be external, it means that an arrangement of molecules inside the brain must have been specifically designed by evolution to create some external link capable of impeccably transferring information, all of which without leaving absolutely any evidence of the link or external entity (unless you count stuff like NDEs, which for obvious reasons shouldn’t count). Gravity is just a fundamental poorly understand fact of our reality. The latter seems a lot easier to stomach. An interesting sensation/trait emerging from matter developing thought and higher order thought is an astronomically more likely answer.</p>

            <p>consciousness could be described as a recursive function between potential (inner processes) and reality (observations of the external)</p>
<p>also, it could be argued that any life has consciousness (as opposed to self-consciousness), since all life perceives impulses and processes those impulses in some way<br>
that’s basically what consciousness is</p>

            <p>Personally I would say that even though your entire self is contained within the body, consciousness as a concept can still be considered external simply because the self is procedurally generated by compiling data gathered from <span class="bbcode-i">outside</span>.</p>

            <p>Now they’re “thought experiments”.  Your not having thought experiments.  You are arguing your views on consciousnesses. And going between playful thoughts to lacking evidence to support your claims seriousness, whichever suits the argument you are trying to make.  A thought experiment doesn’t need proof.  It doesn’t prove anything.  Its just taking a scenario and asking what you think of it.  If these have been thought experiments than your just injecting wrong and right into something that lacks conclusive answers.  But this comes back to arguing with a wall, which what it seems like I am doing. So this’ll be my last post regarding this.</p>

<p>You in this very thread have made “fun speculation” you have no proof for your thoughts or ideas.  Yet you criticize others thoughts and ideas based on fuckall.  Why is yours “fun speculation” and theirs “supernatural”.  Your just playing with words.  Spewing rhetoric. An argument the by product of a common disdain for anything labeled as fantasy when applied to the real world but turning around and spouting science-fiction which is frequently no more than fantasy but with sciency-sounding words and lazers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My argument hasn’t been about the burden of proof, you’ve brought that in here. People said that my claims could not be made because my assumption of a non-external consciousness is baseless. I then attempted to show that an external consciousness is not a realistic explanation. Once again, one can’t formally prove a negative, but it’s perfectly reasonable to provide evidence against a theory in order to reject the theory.</p>
<p>If a magician performed a trick and you proposed that he performed the trick in a certain way, regardless of the burden of proof I could point out a flaw in your explanation that informally disproves it.</p>
<p>I think you’re taking this argument a little more seriously than I am or the others involved.</p>
<p>I label one “supernatural” because it conflicts with our understanding of the situation (a separate entity emerging from the process of evolution). I label the other “fun speculation” because it, at least to me, sounds reasonable with no conflict, but really has no solid footing upon which to stand. I used that label to split the two parts of my discussion, one in which I am trying to be more strict and rational, and the other where I’m going out on a limb for the sake of interest and possibility. Someone could show me that my “fun speculation” is actually “supernatural” if they pointed out a flaw in my reasoning. However “supernatural” usually has an air of mysticism which my minimalist explanation certainly does not give off.</p>
<p>I have equal disdain for science fiction as I do for fantasy. What I’ve been spouting is thought experiments. For the sake of a thought experiment you can create whatever conditions you want to test a theory that may not be easily tested in reality. Simply because the conditions I set fall within the realm of sci-fi does not mean sci-fi is my concern. I simply use sci-fi conditions to attempt to shed light on real-world questions about consciousness.</p>

I showed that the idea of an external soul is unfounded, thus putting it on level with the celestial teapot or unicorns.</p>
<p>I can’t prove a negative, but I can bring strong evidence against a claim, which I believe I’ve successfully done. Also this could hardly be called science, this is philosophy.</p>
<p>The former of your two links is largely rejected, according to your very link, by modern scientists/philosophers. The latter highlights that it simply aims to use quantum mechanical thought as a model, and doesn’t actually involve quantum mechanics, thus it in no way affects the thought experiment.</p>
<p>Here’s another thought experiment, or more of simply a question. If you made an android whose electronic brain could operate entirely on the same level as a human brain in every way, would it be somehow lacking? Missing a “soul” or something similar?</p>
<p>I would say absolutely not. What is so special about the organic assembly of our brain that sets it aside from the factory assembly of a theoretical android’s brain? The fun part is in a world of these androids they’d likely tell themselves they had an external entity defining their consciousness just as we do.</p>

</aside>
<p>My point wasn’t against yours.  I don’t have an investment in the ideas presented.  My point was your argument is pointless because you can’t prove a negative.  Well I tend to agree that the burden of proof is on the claim maker it doesn’t change the fact that you can’t prove it wrong just that its a lacking concept no matter where you think you should place the burden of proof you CANNOT PROVE A NEGATIVE.  Arguing with someone who’s argument amounts to you don’t know that it doesn’t exist is pointless.  This person doesn’t accept your logic behind burden of proof.  You are arguing with a wall.  Reason and logical are a human inventions and exist in human consciousness.  You may not understand this but not everyone follows the same train of thought and when you have a conflict of rational as simple as who the burden of proof lies on further arguments will go nowhere.</p>
<p>I didn’t even look at the links I gave you to be completely honest.  I recall reading something about a quantum mechanics brain having impacts on the way some people “out of body experiences” and thought it’d be suitable.  The point was that ideas you seem to think are meta-physical can some times be viewed in a scientific light and possibility through which can be explored and may potentially hold answers it may not.  Most hypothesis end up to be considered wrong.</p>
<p>You in this very thread have made “fun speculation” you have no proof for your thoughts or ideas.  Yet you criticize others thoughts and ideas based on fuckall.  Why is yours “fun speculation” and theirs “supernatural”.  Your just playing with words.  Spewing rhetoric. An argument the by product of a common disdain for anything labeled as fantasy when applied to the real world but turning around and spouting science-fiction which is frequently no more than fantasy but with sciency-sounding words and lazers.</p>
<p>That said I’m an occam’s razor kinda guy myself so I tend to think if we know the brain controls the body then the consciousness relating to that body would probably reside in that brain and in the electric signals we observe.  But we do not KNOW this and occam’s razor is not always true.</p>

            <p>I always figured a soul was merely a conscience, the ability to feel emotion and act upon it rationally (or irrationally be it the case) and reason. If we were to create it to be completely identical to humans, would it not be safe to assume it does possess a soul, if a soul were nothing but a working conscience?</p>

I showed that the idea of an external soul is unfounded, thus putting it on level with the celestial teapot or unicorns.</p>
<p>I can’t prove a negative, but I can bring strong evidence against a claim, which I believe I’ve successfully done. Also this could hardly be called science, this is philosophy.</p>
<p>The former of your two links is largely rejected, according to your very link, by modern scientists/philosophers. The latter highlights that it simply aims to use quantum mechanical thought as a model, and doesn’t actually involve quantum mechanics, thus it in no way affects the thought experiment.</p>
<p>Here’s another thought experiment, or more of simply a question. If you made an android whose electronic brain could operate entirely on the same level as a human brain in every way, would it be somehow lacking? Missing a “soul” or something similar?</p>
<p>I would say absolutely not. What is so special about the organic assembly of our brain that sets it aside from the factory assembly of a theoretical android’s brain? The fun part is in a world of these androids they’d likely tell themselves they had an external entity defining their consciousness just as we do.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because it’s a claim as unfounded as “unicorns exist” that only came about because people want to feel special and want to think they’re not going to die. Also because consciousness is a very difficult/impossible thing to understand/describe, and inventing an external entity makes for an at least superficially simple to understand answer to the question.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense because of my post above about how it’d be non-nonsensical for such an entity to emerge separate from the body as the product of evolution.</p>

<p>You are making a LOT of assumptions about what consciousness IS, and how <span class="bbcode-i">IT</span> works, without knowing anything. Basically there can only be one awake consciousness per body, there can’t be two bodies with the same consciousness, because the bodies are experiencing different inputs (through their senses) and therefore storing different memories. This logic only works because you are assuming that there are particular consciousnesses per body or a ‘particular set of atoms’. No one can know what or how consciousness works, so we don’t know whether consciousness is an actual seemingly external physical thing/state (like a soul) that is attached to a body from birth, or if it arises from the physical way that information is in ultra order within a super complex and ordered object such as the brain. Both sound far fetched and both are related in that we can never reason or use logic to work out if either are correct, in fact, any explanation in between also cannot be properly understood because there is no way to know.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The part about what I think consciousness actually is is just fun speculation by my part, not to be taken as an objective argument, just an interesting suggestion.</p>
<p>I think you can absolutely rule out consciousness as an external entity. It goes back to how I said consciousness isn’t special. It can’t be external without being “supernatural” (I use supernatural not to label the unexplained, but the made up). For consciousness to be an external entity such as the supernatural soul it would require that there is more to the human brain, in fact any brain, than the particular arrangement of molecules. I challenge any such “special” interpretation because it is completely unfounded and wouldn’t make sense in the context of evolution; consciousness under evolution must emerge as the further development of the brain. How could such a development be aided by the materialization of an outside entity appended to the brain? There was a point in our development where we did not have consciousness, and then there was a point where we did (obviously the line is probably much blurrier than that, one could simply pick a point on either side of the grey to make this claim). The only difference between those two points is mutation and natural selection.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand that. By the same logic, how do you know you’re the same you were ten minutes ago? Someone could have replaced you with a robotic duplicate with fake memories, and be out there right now torturing the real you.</p>
