<p>its kind of surreal all of the sudden seeing a alleged timegate employee come into the anonomyous-copypastariddled shitpit of reddit right after a alleged gearbox employee did just that</p>
<p>even with “shitty management”, so they say, there was no excuse for timegate to make the game worse when it was so much better in alpha/e3 stages</p>

            <p>Rushing? I mean they did give Gearbox six years.</p>
<p>I think it was a large scale clashing of interests. Sega seemed to be under the assumption that Gearbox would drop everything to develop and ship A:CM, but they didn’t.</p>

            <p>its amusing the story behind who made the game shitty is more interesting than the game itself</p>
<p>that said, i believe SEGA and Timegate are the main to blame (SEGA for rushing the product, and timegate for shitting up the project at the point of development where gearbox can no longer delay the project)</p>
<p>if you think of it, the e3 demo was all Gearbox’s work (and the e3 build was allegidly “better” than the final product)</p>

            <p>Maybe it’s just because it’s been so long, I complained about that being gone in AvP 2010 but I actually don’t mind not having it.</p>
<p>Not that I wouldn’t be against it if they could find a way to re-implement it, or a way to make it make sense [COLOR=‘DimGray’](Facehugging a corporate give you a dog alien?)</p>
<p>Part of it could be because I’m just thankful to have a new Aliens game where multiplayer doesn’t boil down to pointless frustration, cheap kills, and a game where the title race isn’t made near useless when not spamming E.</p>

            <p>Maybe that patch contains an actual good campaign. GBX was just trolling all along and will finally release the industry changing game of the century.</p>

            <p>It really is a shame, because the MP seems to have been made in the right mindset. It’s tense, you need to work together to survive, and way better than anything the SP had to offer. I really hope they support this game on the MP side of things at least, because that’s the only thing keeping me from regretting purchasing it.</p>
<p>I don’t want it to go down the same road as AvP 2010’s MP, where even though it had potential they cut off support for it and never fixed the game’s glaring issues.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>That’s a pretty big update if that were true, but it’s probably just a baseless rumor</p>

            <p>The problem was that they were basically hyping the campaign as an official sequel to the movie Aliens, so people were expecting it to kick all kinds of ass. Instead they got an ass to kick.</p>

            <p>yeah, but COD grew into that kind of game. It’s initial popularity came from its (at the time) authentic grounded campaigns (funny, huh?).  That’s now how it started. That’s typically the story for most MP centered games nowadays except for battlefield.</p>

            <p>Aren’t there plenty of people who play games mostly for the multiplayer? The more recent CoD games comes to mind.</p>

            <p>I hear they outsourced most of the SP to Timegate Studios, which is funny considering how much they ranted about their love of the franchise.</p>
<p>The multiplayer is actually pretty damn good though, and fairly balanced and fun to play as both sides and tense for Marines. Problem is while the modes are nice and diverse, there is serious lack of maps. If they don’t release free content, I can’t imagine people staying forever. Not a lot of people are gonna buy DLC when they paid full price for what is essentially half of a game.</p>
<p>Then again, AvP 2010 had a small map selection of mostly shit when it came out, and people bought the DLC anyway so I don’t know.</p>
