    <title>State and condition of dead bodies</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/state-and-condition-of-dead-bodies/10949</link>
    <description>In my first playthrough, I noticed that all the dead bodies (I&#39;m not certain it&#39;s actually 100%) strewn throughout Black Mesa are whole and intact. I think there should be numerous instances where dead bodies should have missing limbs or being torn in half, either across the waist or head-to-crotch or diagonally. I did notice coming across appendages on their own, a leg here, an arm over there which one would expect to find, considering the circumstances.

Also, whenever I came across a Zombie or a Bullsquid in the process of feeding, the human body was always intact. It could be a situation where the feeding process had just begun, but there should also be instances where it may have begun some time earlier. In that case, the body should be partially consumed and not whole. How about Xenians feeding on HECU marines? Maybe not, to avoid sympathetic feelings towards the HECU? Screw the sympathy factor. They should be on the menu as well. What better way to fill your belly than devouring someone who just killed your fellow Xenian buddy?  

Also, are there any instances of unconscious humans having an active headcrab on its head, other than shortly after the resonance cascade event? A headcrab on an unconscious female would be appropriate as well. These types of scenarios should be found throughout Black Mesa. How about on a HECU marine? Sympathy reasons, again? Mmmmm.

Now, I&#39;m not a macabre person, just thinking of ways to deepen the immersion factor on a monumental and tragic event.

Maybe some of these observances/suggestions can be incorporated into future patches/possible further game development.</description>

<p>I wasn’t gonna’ say nuthin’!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But, yeah, that torso did throw me off a bit. It’s as you say - the torso looks so pristine it actually comes off a bit like a clothes mannequin. Really, though, the gibbing system isn’t bad. I bring up L4D2 just because it’s probably the best example I’ve seen pretty much anywhere, but I can easily see how that might require a ridiculous effort that’s plain not worth it. And considering what the original Half-Life had (toss random internal parts in all direction), you’ve done quite well, I’d say. And, hey, Black Mesa doesn’t have any instances of gibbing one guy and getting three skulls in the pile. I’m less concerned with him having three heads and more with where the two I wasn’t seeing were.</p>
<p>The gib system actually reminds me a tad of UT2003, in the sense that it’s mostly it takes limbs off at the joints, though hearing you need separate models for it surprises me. Would not have called that. And in UT2003, I actually turned off model dismemberment because I enjoyed watching the ragdolls ragdollise more  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  So, yeah, I’m not that demanding of gibbing and would probably not have minded if it didn’t exist in the first place. That guard that gets cut in half by the laser really ought to get cut in half, though.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of the Unforeseen Conequences guard - the previous laser that cuts up a large machine doesn’t seem to cut it in any way that resembles its path. Just wanted to point this out.</p>

            <p>I thought this was an issue with the models for Half Life 2 style NPCs being unable to be ‘chopped up’ or decapitated? It’s either a whole body or bits and pieces, not both as far as I can see.</p>
<p>I agree I would have loved to see decapitated, missing limbed or cut in half bodies, but I’m sure it’s just not possible to do with the models, otherwise it would have been done before.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa is not really a gore-centric game.  L4D2 has a very clever system (you can read about it here: <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf" data-bbcode="true">https://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2010/gdc2010_vlachos_l4d2wounds.pdf</a>) but ultimately it still requires upwards of 12 “gore” models and a lot of custom shader/code support.  Plus, zombie mutilation is the whole point of their entire game… this is an important thing for them to get right.</p>
<p>Black Mesa has to juggle a lot of other more important factors, but we did still make our own custom gib system… see here: <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Gib_System" data-bbcode="true">https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Gib_System</a></p>
<p>Our system is extremely simple to implement into any model… you simply indicate the hitpoints, type of gibbing and what other models should spawn out of it.  These models in turn can spawn other models, which can spawn other models, to an unlimited degree.  The limitation is it doesn’t support partial gibbing, it’s either BOOM explosion of bodyparts or nothing at all.</p>
<p>Personally I’m not a huge fan of our torso gib model, all limbs neatly clipped off of it and the torso itself untouched… but all it would take is some dedicated and twisted modeler from our community to make us a new one and we could switch it out no problem B)</p>

            <p>It would also be a freakishly huge effort. You need a separate model for EVERY combination of limb and head blown off. Do the math.</p>
<p>I doubt the devs would deem that to be an efficient use of their time.</p>

            <p>Considering the remarkably high quality gore on the Zombie models, especially the faces, I’d have to say I agree. Would have been nice to see a couple dedicated corpse models.</p>

            <p>In my first playthrough, I noticed that all the dead bodies (I’m not certain it’s actually 100%) strewn throughout Black Mesa are whole and intact. I think there should be numerous instances where dead bodies should have missing limbs or being torn in half, either across the waist or head-to-crotch or diagonally. I did notice coming across appendages on their own, a leg here, an arm over there which one would expect to find, considering the circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, whenever I came across a Zombie or a Bullsquid in the process of feeding, the human body was always intact. It could be a situation where the feeding process had just begun, but there should also be instances where it may have begun some time earlier. In that case, the body should be partially consumed and not whole. How about Xenians feeding on HECU marines? Maybe not, to avoid sympathetic feelings towards the HECU? Screw the sympathy factor. They should be on the menu as well. What better way to fill your belly than devouring someone who just killed your fellow Xenian buddy?</p>
<p>Also, are there any instances of unconscious humans having an active headcrab on its head, other than shortly after the resonance cascade event? A headcrab on an unconscious female would be appropriate as well. These types of scenarios should be found throughout Black Mesa. How about on a HECU marine? Sympathy reasons, again? Mmmmm.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not a macabre person, just thinking of ways to deepen the immersion factor on a monumental and tragic event.</p>
<p>Maybe some of these observances/suggestions can be incorporated into future patches/possible further game development.</p>
