    <description>Hi guys

I have been trying without success to get a screenshot of the Crowbar Collective screen that appears for a split second when BM loads - I think this is a stunning image and wanted to use it for wallpaper  on my system. Does anyone know how I could do this? I need a 1900x1200 or bigger.

*Edit*
