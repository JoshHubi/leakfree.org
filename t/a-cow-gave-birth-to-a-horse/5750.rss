    <title>A cow gave birth to a horse</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-cow-gave-birth-to-a-horse/5750</link>
    <description>[align=center]In a strange natural phenomenon, a cow gave birth to a horse as well as a calf last week in a small hamlet outside of San Pedro de Macoris, in the Dominican Republic.

Salomón Elías, the local Mayor was conducting the delivery of the calf which initially seemed perfectly normal.

After having removed the calf, Elias noted that in there appeared to be another baby in the cow, and when it came to delivery, it turned out it was a “colt” (name given to young horses), that attracted the attention of many.

The owner of the cow, Julio Fernandez, a local businessman said he could not explain the phenomenon, and that was the first time he’d seen anything like it in all his time dealing with animals.

The horse was stillborn, but it was fully formed, as you can see from the photo.

</aside>
<p>Haha, you clearly have no scientific knowledge whatsoever. It was a mutated sheep that just happened to resemble a human. If this story has any truth to it it will be the same; a severely mutated calf that happens to look like a colt. Now it is a tiny bit more plausible as cows and horses are far more similar, but I still doubt it. Animals of one species can’t mate with animals of another species unless the two are incredibly similar.</p>
