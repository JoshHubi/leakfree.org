    <description>Hi, and welcome to this thread.

Well, the thing is simple, I make a player model for BMS: MP. but i don&#39;t know how to put that in BMS, is basic, i riged the new hev suit, and I put the head of the persons in the hev suit, simple.

The models will be in the workshop in the future.

Here is some pictures:
