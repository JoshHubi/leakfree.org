    <title>Problem with Penumbra: Overture</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/problem-with-penumbra-overture/2027</link>
    <description>There&#39;s no problem with movement or interaction. Only the graphs sometimes gets weird, like, according to your current position, there can or can&#39;t appear colorful polygons on map and objects. I&#39;m running it on a windows vista.
There&#39;s any way I can solve this?</description>

            <p>What is the model of your graphics card? I had the same problem with my ATI card.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/penumbraoverture/patch/32719.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/penumbraoverture/patch/32719.html</a></p>
<p>Download the patch if you have an ATI card. Hope this helps!:retard:</p>
<p>Whoops, almost forgot, you have to put the executable in your Program Files &gt;&gt; Steam &gt;&gt; steamapps &gt;&gt; common &gt;&gt; penumbra overture &gt;&gt; redist folder, and run the new executable instead of the old one. Unfortunately, you can’t run it from Steam anymore. I just made a shortcut to it on my desktop.</p>

            <p>If by graphs you mean graphics, then it sounds like corruption on your videocard and if it persists, is probably due to your videocard slowly dieing and needing replacment.</p>
