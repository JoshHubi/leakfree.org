    <title>Portal 2 like Co-op?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-2-like-co-op/12027</link>
    <description>I know that the co-op was cancelled from the game, but I was wondering if it would be possible to include something similar to what Portal did.  Have two separate plots that combine somehow.  I was thinking something along the lines of Decay, as it was originally designed to be co-op based.

            <p>Decay has been ported to PC as an HL1 mod, and I believe there is a remake mod in progress for Source, but it is not affiliated with BM.</p>
