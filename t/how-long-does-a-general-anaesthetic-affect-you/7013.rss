    <title>How long does a general anaesthetic affect you?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-long-does-a-general-anaesthetic-affect-you/7013</link>
    <description>I had a general anaesthetic on Tuesday to have a wisdom tooth removed and I still feel awful.
I have no appetite,I feel sick and all I want to do is sleep.
Someone told me that the general can continue to affect you for a few days after your op-does anyone know?</description>
