    <title>Gibs and blood. I want to stop vomiting.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gibs-and-blood-i-want-to-stop-vomiting/12052</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve complained about this on so many games it isn&#39;t funny, but I don&#39;t care, and I still get squeamish at the sight of blood and the new gib system grosses me out. If anybody has done or plans on replacing blood textures or removing gibs, be my guest. But if nobody has, I may be making my first actual contribution to the community.

Here&#39;s the deal:
violence_hblood and violence_hgibs blah blah they don&#39;t work as well on black mesa. I&#39;ve made a texture edit for half life 2 that removes some of the blood in the game (zombies mostly) and I may do a similar project on Black Mesa.

Example of my HL2 zombie edit [img]https://img708.imageshack.us/img708/8391/zombehb.png[/img]
oh and If you are like me here&#39;s a download: [url]https://www.mediafire.com/?toustyq9qdlqt88[/url]</description>

            <p>Big deal. Don’t like gore, don’t play shooter games. I don’t LIKE gore myself, but I’m not that kind of person who goes all out vomiting when he gets a fucking nosebleed!</p>
<p>So, as others said. Stop. Playing. Or get used to gore.</p>
<p>Don’t think you wouldn’t kill if it was directly a question of your very own survival. We all would. Those who wouldn’t propably wish to die anyway.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Okay, folks, let’s stay on topic.  The OP wants to know how to remove the blood decals and disable gibs.  I think disabling gibs is selectable in the options menu.  As for removing the blood decals, I think that would require some texture editing or something.</p>
<p>Black Mesa is a shooting video game where aliens come and sometimes eat and otherwise eviscerate humans, and you shoot other humans.  This will necessitate some level of violence and gore.  I’m not sure why you’d want to play a game where you can kill humans but get squeamish over blood and gibs, but there’s that.</p>
<p>If there’s a way to remove the blood decals and the gibs, please provide that information, folks, instead of berating the OP.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You had your helpful response. I’m going to put this bluntly. You’re a quease, a lightweight, and you have a fucking sonic avatar. Not the cool original felix the cat style sonic, the shitty “way past cool” sonic. We don’t like you. I’m surprised you even got a legitimate response.</p>

<p>gee, all I was asking for was the console command to make gibs not show.<br>
And really what does it matter if I like Sonic? We aren’t here to argue about classic/modern (for the record I used to have a classic avatar), we’re here to argue about Black Mesa. You brought my Sonic interest up, not me.<br>
Now let’s all stop being douches to each other and get on to something more important. I really don’t care. My parents watching me play games is more of the problem than me being sqeamish.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’m pretty proud of how far this forum has come. It was almost facepunch levels of unchecked personal criticizm when I first joined.</p>
