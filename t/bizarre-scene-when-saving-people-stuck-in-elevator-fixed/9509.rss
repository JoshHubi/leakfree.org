After stopping elevator from falling those NPCs stand there in that rather funny pose.  :wink: 

After going up (and loading) though, elevator is fallen at the bottom but barrell stays still at the place.

Same happens if you go up before elevator falls (in both cases elevator button hasnt been pressed).</description>

            <p>That’s actually a recurring problem in quite a few places: Physics objects will get stuck under and between moving objects and cause them to jam. I exploded one US Marine turret, causing a blast door in “We’ve Got Hostiles” to self-seal in the process, and the turret fell under the door. This prevented it from closing completely, yet also prevented me from using the emergency button to open it and made it impossible to get through.</p>
<p>I think, if at all possible, that large objects like lifts, blast-resistant gates and so forth should be able to crush physics objects even if they are normally indestructible. Either that, or all physics objects should be destructible. It’s all too easy to bump into a barrel, knock it down an incline and have it roll into wall mines, explode them and cause a blast door to close down on top of it, making the game unwinnable.</p>

            <p>Yeah you weren’t intended to be able to save the elevator. Until now I’ve found Black Mesa to be a great case of “the dev team thinks of everything” but clearly that’s one thing they didn’t think of!</p>
