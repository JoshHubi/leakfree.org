    <description>I tried downloading the Torrent file on the website and it didnt work. I downloaded both files and tried to install the setup and It says it couldnt find the file and asks if I downloaded it when I obviously did. I tried every other file as well and those didnt work either.</description>

            <p>You dont need to move the trackers file.</p>
<p>Use the tracker (.torrent) file in a program such as uTorrent, or bitTorrent to download the files. Using that program will automatically create a folder in your default download directory called ‘BlackMesa’ Inside that folder should be 3 files.</p>
<p>Open the one that ends in .exe and OK through the installer until it installs. Upon clicking ‘Finish’ (providing you have ‘Run BMS’ checked) it will automatically run BMS.</p>
<p>On a side note: are you trying to do this in windows?</p>
