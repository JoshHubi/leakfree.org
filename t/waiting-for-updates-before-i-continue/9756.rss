    <description>It&#39;s too much. The micro lags, the fraction-of-a-second freezes in cinematics and renders. It looks/feels like a GODLY HL remake, dont get me wrong. I just have a real hard time/get real agitated with all the little hiccups in the game. I&#39;ll be waiting a few updates before I continue to play it. &gt; :frowning:  :frowning:  :frowning:  :frowning:  :frowning:</description>

            <p>Multicore rendering is in some ways just a way for people with multicore processors to feel they’re getting some use from it. Generally, even when it’s supported, Valve hasn’t optimized that feature enough for it to have any real benefit and people are usually recommended to turn it off.</p>

<p>These stuttering problems are most likely related to your pc. There is some sort of hardware issue, setting, or driver that is causing this, not the game itself. Thus, it most likely CANNOT be fixed by a Black Mesa software update. As mentioned above you will need to do some research into the problem with the hardware setup you have, and try to find out what is causing the issue.</p>
<p>Edit: doing some research into this, here’s some stuff to try: (try them one at a time)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn your graphic options all the way down to the lowest settings. (texture quality especially)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that ALL external nVidia controls are turned off. (ie. in the nvidia control panel you can force graphic settings into a game… this can cause issues like stuttering)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure you dont have any spyware, adware, or viruses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using SLI, disable it in the nvidia control panel</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>yeah it probably is my vid card…<span class="bbcode-b">nvidia geforce 425m</span>…dont judge, I bought the laptop for school purposes initially. While it’s not a HORRIBLE card, it’s not great either. Plus I can’t afford a custom self build desktop right now (although im fiending badly for one) so I gotta work with what I got. Thing is this card runs HL2 at highest settings just fine. So I dunno what’s going on. Ahwell, I still play it, just because it’s freakin awesome. I can only handle so much micro lagg-age though, until I ragequit and go back to playing CS:GO :fffuuu::meh:</p>

            <p>I wonder why you cant set multicore rendering in game. The game only uses one CPU Core and this one is randomly running at full load so i got random stuttering and FPS drops from &gt;200 to &lt;60  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>I thought source was very ATI-friendly since ever.<br>
Anyway, I’ve played every Valve game in an ATI card, and currently own a Ati 5770. It runs very smoothly as far as I can tell. (I’m at the office complex in BM).</p>
<p>I also have the Steam installation on a OCZ Vertex 4 SSD hard disk, and the rest of my PC specs are: Win7 SP1 x64, 14GB DDR3, Phenom II X4 955 (<span class="mention">@3.2Ghz</span>)</p>

</aside>
<p>interesting, when i got my new ati card i noticed a lot of stuttering where there hadn’t been before. i swapped it with my old nvidia and the stuttering went away.</p>
<p>maybe theres something in my particular setup that doesn’t like ati and source working together.</p>

            <p>I had some stutters at first, then I lowered my textures from Very High to High.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, I defragged after install to decrease load time.</p>

            <p>i don’t get many of those, if you run a search for TF2\HL-2\Left 4 Dead stutter\freeze fix you can find some solutions</p>
<p>ur in for a long haul of experimentation though, solutions range from removing real-tek sound drivers to expanding page memory and all sorts of stuff</p>

            <p>I was afraid things like this would happen. I think I’ll hold out for Steam since hopefully stuff will get resolved by then. On the other hand, it is free. In a way, maybe everyone playing now are actually testers of sorts.</p>
