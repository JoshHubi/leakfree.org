    <title>&quot;On a Rail&quot; securty gate guard non-responsive.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-securty-gate-guard-non-responsive/11016</link>
    <description>Hello, I discovered a glitch where if you quicksave while the guard who opens the little tram barrier is finished talking, but hasn&#39;t opened the gate let, and then quit, when you come back he&#39;ll be nonresponsive and he won&#39;t open the gate until you load your last autosave.

Nothing too game breaking, but it just seems like a little thing that could break immersion or something like that if someone just happens to quicksave there. 

Note: I&#39;ve only experienced this once, and haven&#39;t attempted to reproduce the bug. Would probably still happen though.</description>
