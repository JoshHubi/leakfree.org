    <title>Really bad performance on my system</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/really-bad-performance-on-my-system/14467</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I just bought the Steam version after playing the mod a few years ago.
I wonder what changed since then. The new visuals look very good, but the performance is really really bad.

My system:

AMD Phenom II 960T @ 4Ghz
AMD HD7950 V2 @ 1Ghz
8gb DDR3-1333 Ram

No other programs or something else running at the same time...other games run just fine!

I can play the game on medium settings almost lag-free, above that it drops the framerate quite heavily in many situations.
Is this a bug or is my system too weak for it? Other people with the same expierience? I expected the game to run at max settings... :frowning: 

Thank you!

Joratze

<ul>
<li>Your AMD Phenom II X4 960T is overclocked and could be throttling, have you tried running it at spec speeds.</li>
<li>Whens the last time you blew out the dust bunnies.</li>
<li>Ram speeds can come into play, did you have to modify (lower) ram frequency for a stable overclock.  CAS latency on 1333 DDR3 is sometimes not the fastest.</li>
<li>Are you running the latest drivers, and bios for the mb and gpu.</li>
<li>Windows 10 is still in it’s infancy, more like a beta OS imho. If you got time see how it runs under 7 or 8.1 which has mature drivers.<br>
For comparison I am running an AMD A10-5800k stock, GTX-660 stock with overclocked 16gb DDR3 1866 cas 8-8-8 on Windows 7<br>
It’s not an awesome experience with everything maxed so I decreased some settings.  <span class="mention">@1920x1080</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck on squeezing some more performance out of your setup.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa and all other Source games work flawlessly on both of my machines running Windows 10, so any sweeping general remark that Source games are all universally terrible on Windows 10 cannot be true. There must be something specific about your configuration that causes issues with specifically Black Mesa.</p>

            <p>Kay, thanks.</p>
<p>I just played Episode 2 and the “HL Update”-mod for HL 2 with improved graphics, and Episode 2 seems to run okay, but the mod is nealy as bad as Black Mesa. I will test CS:GO and some other Souce games, but I think it could be Win 10.</p>

            <p>The problem is most likely windows 10 itself. For some unknown reason some games based on the source game engine don’t work very well with windows 10. Do you have any other source based games? If you do do you do you get similar results with them?</p>
<p>I have an earlier version of windows so i have never seen any of this my self.</p>
<p>However if you get good performance on other source based games, those games might have already been updated to fix the issue.</p>
<p>The developers for black mesa are preparing to release their next content update sometime in December, and a fix for this might be included.</p>
<p>However keep in mind that this update will not include xen, yet.</p>
