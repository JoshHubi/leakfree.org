    <title>Issues I&#39;ve found so far</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/issues-ive-found-so-far/14551</link>
    <description>So I recently bought BM and started playing and found a few issues.

1. Dr. Kleiner is flat-shaded(probably forgot to export smoothing groups)
1. Ragdolls glitch out a lot, often times sliding towards one direction of the map. Sometimes just wobbling around on the ground. Especially after reloading from a save, see screenshots below.
1. The crowbar sometimes hits nowhere near where the crosshair is
1. Grenades when thrown also start/hit nowhere near where the crosshair is. This makes precise grenade throws almost impossible because they fly somewhere else as expected and of course don&#39;t bounce of where they should&#39;ve.
1. With the crossbow, if you aim closely above an edge, the dart will hit that edges wall, because for some reason the dart gets fired from a few hundred pixel below the crosshair
1. crouching and standing up multiple times in a row can lead to a half-crouch(intented?)
1. soldiers hold their guns the wrong way, causing the front part and the barrel to stick through their hands
1. A missing monitor screen texture in the lambda labs(sorry, I forgot to get the coordinates, hopefully the screenshot is enough)
1. Music is too loud, drowning out any dialogue that might be active at the same time


And here are some screenshots:

Issue 1:

<p>Right, oops, that was my fault. I simply looked at the image and missed <span class="hashtag">#7</span>, I though you were talking about what I said. Yeah, it has nothing to do with the screen, it’s an animation issue.</p>
<p>As about the crossbow and grenade, HL2 has different mechanics from the ones of BM so they’re bound to differ in some aspects. Pretty much the way they work. They’ll eventually be tweaked anyway, we just need to be patient and report them.</p>

<p>At <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, that’s because the crowbar doesn’t really rely on the crosshair in general, especially in tight places or near walls or anything. It’s kinda ignoring it completely in such situations.</p>
<p>Also no, it’s not like this in HL1 and HL2. The crowbar hits exactly where you point the crosshair at in these 2 games. In L4D yes, it’s the same behavior like in BM. At least it was the last time I played the game.</p>
<p>As about the other issues you reported:</p>
<ol>
<li>Old issue. It was reported quite a while ago but wasn’t fixed to this day apparently.</li>
<li>Another old one.</li>
<li>It seems they ignore the crosshair as well. Since they’re grenades it would be impossible (or very unrealistic) to make them rely on it so much (but not ignore it either).</li>
<li>I think that’s just how the crossbow works, instead of a glitch. They could just try adjusting it and make the crossbow fire slightly above the crosshair. I don’t how how realistic would it be to make it fire EXACTLY through the middle of it. It’s not a fire weapon like the pistol, MP5 and so on, even though they aren’t this accurate anyway. Not even the .357.</li>
<li>Doubt it. I’ve encountered this in CS 1.6 and CSS (not playing CS:GO so I have no idea if it’s there) as well, and even other games. No idea what could be causing it.</li>
<li>Actually both the music and the dialogue don’t seem to have an ideal volume. The dialogue could be a little louder, and the music lower (or much lower in the case of the music). The music sometimes scares me when it suddenly starts playing and I am concentrated on the combat or simply don’t pay attention to the game. The music must never overtake the actual game.<br>
issue <span class="hashtag">#7:</span> From what I remember, the screen fades out after they knock you out (a couple of seconds of lying on the ground), but I could be wrong though.</li>
</ol>

</aside>
<ol start="4">
<li>their trajectory should at least start there though. if you want to throw a grenade below an object which is right in front of you, aiming below it, you’ll likely just blow yourself up, because it just hits the object.</li>
<li>same scenario, you’re right in front of a wall/object and want to shoot above it, it’ll hit the wall instead. The trajectory should start somewhere near the crosshair here as well, so it actually flys somewhere near where you aimed for the first few centimeters.</li>
</ol>
<p>these two issues didn’t happen with HL2 and its crossbow/grenades.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed the same thing with the crowbar. When you stand very close to a wall and look up it will not hit that point on the wall, but rather below it. In vents the crowbar will often hit the upper ceiling instead or swinging through the air in front of you. So far it still worked for enemies without a problem, but it feels very distracting.</p>

            <ol start="3">
<li>That´s normal for melee weapons. The original Half-Life, aswell as Left 4 Dead 2, have the exact same melee behaviour.</li>
<li>They should just make dialogue louder, instead of making the music quieter. One of my biggest gripes about Half-Life 2 was that the wonderful music was to quiet (I maxed it out).</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, I completely agree, even though I don´t see a problem with the crossbow right now.</p>
