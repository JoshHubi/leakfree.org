    <title>PC shuts off while playing games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-shuts-off-while-playing-games/7541</link>
    <description>so I&#39;ve had this problem for over 2 months now, every time I play any intensified 3D game (COD:BO, WOW, Assassin&#39;s creed, etc...) my PC shuts off completely, I&#39;ve ran some tests to see the Heat of my Video card while playing and it only reached about 55-70c, and still I have this problem :S, I&#39;ve checked in every corner around the net and honestly I didn&#39;t find a solution, I&#39;ve updated my drivers and I also checked the ram&#39;s and CPU heats and all turned out to be just fine, so do you guys have any Idea on how to fix this damn problem ?


p.s My Video card is ATI Radeon 5750 Series

            <p>Unstable OC? I cant overclock my gpu at all (radeon 4890). If i do OC it, it crashes within seconds of starting a game.<br>
Try putting your cpu back to its default clock speed and voltages.</p>
<p>Also try running furmark and see if it crashes. If it doesnt, try running a cpu benchmarking app like everest.</p>
<p>Also tell us your temps for everything under full load would be nice.</p>

            <p>The powersupply might not be able to deliver stable voltages. It’s never a good idea to be ‘on the edge’ anyway, you don’t want your powersupply to run at full power all the time.</p>

            <p>Just my two cents, it really does seem like a PSU issue, and i don’t know of any brand name PSUs that have a peak output of 530, but I do know of cheap PSUs that have a max output of 530. It could be that your video card isn’t getting enough amperage on the 12v rails, also probably due to the PSU being a cheap brand.</p>

            <p>Is your CPU temp under load under 70 degrees celcius?</p>
<p>Also try running some test in prime95. We might be able to isolate the GPU out of this.</p>

            <p>He said he checked the temps, so that’s not the problem. Frankly I would really doubt that there’s an issue with your house’s wiring unless the breaker/GFI trips. Does the PSU have some brand name on it?</p>

            <p>Well, depending on where you live and if you can get the brand NOX there, they currently have the NOX Urano 650 and 750w models in discount as they are bringing a new model out next month, now I know this is happening all over Europe, no idea about the rest, have a look for it as it´s a rather good PSU that´s quite cheap, I´d say, as good as it gets in value/quality ration for an under 80+ seal psu.</p>

            <p>so I’ve had this problem for over 2 months now, every time I play any intensified 3D game (COD:BO, WOW, Assassin’s creed, etc…) my PC shuts off completely, I’ve ran some tests to see the Heat of my Video card while playing and it only reached about 55-70c, and still I have this problem :S, I’ve checked in every corner around the net and honestly I didn’t find a solution, I’ve updated my drivers and I also checked the ram’s and CPU heats and all turned out to be just fine, so do you guys have any Idea on how to fix this damn problem ?</p>
<p>p.s My Video card is ATI Radeon 5750 Series</p>
