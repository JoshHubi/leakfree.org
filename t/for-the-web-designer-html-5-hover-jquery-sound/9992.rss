    <title>(For the web designer) - HTML 5 hover/jQuery sound</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/for-the-web-designer-html-5-hover-jquery-sound/9992</link>
    <description>Hey, this is directed to the web designer. Firstly, cool site!  :slight_smile:  

However I did notice something was not done properly in regards to the hover-sounds on the menu. 

I worked with Google groups and Mozilla groups on implementing a plugin and/or methodology to do this hover-sound effect issue. The [i]issue itself[/i] is that when you hover over one of the buttons in the navigation, you&#39;ll notice that the sound file must complete before it will activate on the next hover.

This is fixable by doing the following in javascript and/or jQuery:

[code]$(&quot;#navIdOrClass&quot;).hover(function(){
sound.play();  //where [I]sound[/I] is a variable that relates the audio element in HTML 5
},
function(){
sound.load();  //This is a new HTML 5 implementation to force-reload the audio element. What this will do is instantly reset the sound once the user&#39;s mouse cursor leaves the navigation element. Allowing for instantaneous resetting of the audio element without have to let it finish before it can be played again.
});[/code]

All in all, it isn&#39;t really a bug, just something that as a UI-coder/designer I think is extremely easy now with this new methodology in HTML 5 to implement and it prevents users from being confused when they hover over a navigational element.


An example can be displayed on my experimental animation/sound website here:

^That&#39;s the site im working with Google Groups and Mozilla on to experiment with animations, fullscreen elements, and sound elements in combination. Getting away from Flash. Which, I&#39;m very proud to see that you(the web designer) did.  :smiley: 

This is by no means a form of [i]&quot;advertisement&quot;[/i] or whatever, it&#39;s just the only way I have of demonstrating to you(the web designer) what it is that I&#39;m talking about.

I hope this helps!!!!

Oh, and Black Mesa: Source is SICK!!!!!!! Thumbs up x2 guys, great job.</description>
