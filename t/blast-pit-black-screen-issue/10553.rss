    <title>Blast Pit: Black screen issue.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/blast-pit-black-screen-issue/10553</link>
    <description>Bug:

In the level &quot;Blast pit&quot; when I get to the green toxic goo after the ride with the cart, my screen goes black after passing a certain point (climbing down the ladder), and by black I mean pitch black I can&#39;t see a thing, if I turn on the flashlight the screen turns blue. I can see my HUD and when I shoot with something it turns slightly red like when you&#39;re hurt and you can see again in red darkish color but only for a slight time (doesn&#39;t work with crowbar or a grenade). I actually got further by using that but finally ran out of ammo. The screen doesn&#39;t return to normal even if you advance to the next huge toxic pit.
Any idea how to fix this?

Edit: If I pick up something and start hitting it against walls or something the screen goes red too for a short time, it&#39;s like I&#39;m blind and am coordinated by sounds.</description>
