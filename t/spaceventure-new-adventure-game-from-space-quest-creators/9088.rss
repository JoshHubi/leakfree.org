    <title>SpaceVenture - new adventure game from Space Quest creators</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/spaceventure-new-adventure-game-from-space-quest-creators/9088</link>
    <description>I dont know how many of you were into adventure gaming in the late 80&#39;s early 90&#39;s, but I grew up playing the Space Quest series.  The creators (Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy aka &quot;[url=&#39;https://guysfromandromeda.com/&#39;]Two Guys From Andromeda[/url]&quot;) have reunited to design and create SpaceVenture, their first true collaboration since Space Quest 4.  I&#39;ve played other adventure games, but none had as much charm, humor, and fun as SQ.  I&#39;m interested in seeing how this turns out.

I&#39;m not sure if many of you are interested in adventure gaming, but I thought I&#39;d make a topic just in case.</description>

<p>Wow, I had no idea SQ7 was supposed to be first person.  I just know the project was abandoned a while back.</p>
<p>I’m just glad Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy are working together again.  SQ4 was the last game designed by both of “The Two Guys” (SQ5 and SQ6 definitely had a different feel to them).  SpaceVenture will probably be the closest thing to an official Space Quest 7 we will ever see.</p>

            <p>Ah, yes. I remember Space Quest quite fondly. It was no QUEST OF KINGS, though.</p>
<p>(It was much, much better.)</p>

            <p>My first computer game I ever played on our home machine was Space Quest 1 EGA… and that was when I was 9!</p>
<p>I loved that series, so much fun. Actually I played SQ1 VGA the other night…</p>
<p>Anyway, this should be a blast, the two guys are back together as they should be!</p>
<p>Just so everyone knows, Space Quest 1 -6 was made by Sierra Online between ~1986 and ~1994. There was a planned SQ7, but Sierra was sold around that time and the project abandoned. Rumour has it that SQ7 was supposed to be the series first FPS style adventure game where you solve puzzles and whatnot… strange how HL1 came out only a couple of years later…</p>
