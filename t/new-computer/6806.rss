    <title>New Computer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-computer/6806</link>
    <description>My dad is looking to buy a new office computer with a budget of 500. Does anyone have any brand suggestions or particular computers? He&#39;ll be looking for a fast computer that will last him a long time. He is getting rid of his old computer after about 10 years and will probably want this new computer to last 10 years. He already has a monitor kb and m.

Also, I was wondering if it&#39;d be more cost effective to go with a 700 dollar budget. Since he is expecting to use this computer for a long time I think it would last as long as he wanted and in the long run save him money if he went with a 700 dollar computer. 

Finally, how would I go about transferring all of his files on his old computer to his new computer?

Edit: Just glancing around newegg I found this computer: [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883147509&#39;]Computer[/url]</description>

            <p>While dual channel would give a bump in performance, I don’t think it’s worth the effort of returning a single stick for two smaller ones. If you don’t mind waiting then why not, but if I were you I’d just keep the 4gb stick and then add another one in a few years or so.</p>

<p>Shame I caught this too late.  The number of sticks of RAM you have has nothing at all to do with how your computer stores data (that is, permanent data on your hard drive).  And if you meant volatile, in-the-moment data (i.e. stored in memory) then it actually makes it easier for the PC (from a bottlenecking standpoint) if you have at least dual channel.</p>
<p>You would have been better off getting yourself a dual channel kit to go with the Core processor - even though this doesn’t need to be a gaming monster, dual channel would definitely help the system for general performance.  I’d recommend 2x2GB DDR3 @ 1333 to go with the Core i3 (like they mentioned in that article you posted).</p>
<p>That said, the system should still be okay with 1x4GB, but if you have the option, I’d return it for the 2x2 kit.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yeah, my dad got me one without telling me from ebay (made me pay for all of it too meh ) and you cannot really upgrade anything at all. I see a lot of Dell computers in schools, libraries ect. They dont seem bad for offices at all.</p>

            <p>The Dell computer you chose is already very outdated and very overpriced, but if that doesn’t bother u then go for it. Since you’re so set on pre-built, I’d recommend checking out craigslist for some cheap rigs, or maybe a local store like best buy where they occasionally have some cheap computers on clearance (rarely). I very much recommend building it yourself for many reasons, but if you really can’t be assed, then those are your best options.</p>
<p>Just make sure that your keyboard and mouse are USB, because if they’re also 10 years old then theres a good chance that they use the old PS/2 format (purple and green connectors) and almost all modern machines, especially dells, don’t retain compatibility for such old input devices, unfortunately. But if they’re not USB you can try your luck with a ps/2 to USB converter from eBay, but I’ve never tried those so ymmv.</p>

<p>Don’t get this!. HP’s are crap. They break after 1½ year. And that’s only if you are lucky.</p>

            <p>If you want durable, I’d go with Asus. I got an Asus laptop a few years back, it ran Windows Vista 64 bit, which normally has a ton of glitches and errors, but I never had a single hardware problem or software problem. They’re a tiny bit overpriced, (Not like Alienware or anything) but in my opinion it will be worth it if your getting a prebuilt.</p>

            <p>Well, my dad is insisting on a prebuilt.</p>
<p>I’ve got a Dell I’m looking at and frankly I just want to get this over with. If nobody sees any glaring problems with this computer I think I’m going to go for it.<br>
<a href="https://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-560/pd?oc=dddoaa6&amp;model_id=inspiron-560" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Dell desktop</a> I’ll probably add an extra 2 gigs of RAM for 55 dollars. Maybe that part I’ll do my self if buying the RAM and installing it separately will save much money. Anybody have any recommendations on that?</p>

            <p>Even so, I would still recommend building one yourself. Start with a mobo, either a p55 or h67 ( if you’d like to go inboard graphics) and then just pick a CPU that is the same socket as the mobo ( probably a core i3 or i5, based on how much power you are willing to pay for). The trickiest part is figuring out what RAM is compatible. This can be done by looking at the compatibility charts for your particular mobo AND CPU, it’s not hard if you know what to look for. From there pick a case and a pci-e graphics card if you need one, and a good brand name PSU, likely around 500 watts, and a SATA he’d. There are tons of tutorials on how to assemble the parts on google, just start with the mobo and CPU. The CPU heatsink is really easy to put on if you do go with an Intel Core i3 or i5. Put in your RAM, and then put the mobo in the case, ensuring that you have the right standoff posts in the right place, or you’ll short your mobo on the tray. Throw in the hdd and gpu and hook up the psu and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>I’ve built 3 computers from scratch, and they have all worked flawlessly. You can’t screw up if you’re careful and can follow instructions. In terms of value, going with custom build means you can get more powerful parts for your 500 bones, or you can choose what you want to sacrifice and save more money.</p>

            <p>I’m gonna go at odds with everyone in this thread and say I don’t see the point in building a computer for office work. Main thing you want in a work machine is rock-solid stability. It doesn’t need to handle much</p>
<p>Picked up my mate’s old Dell for my dad, was a dual core with 2.5GB ram. Not the most powerful machine, but more than enough for what it’s used for. Only £50 as well</p>
<p>I use an Acer laptop for my work. Again, just a dual core with 2GB ram and an integrated graphics card. Runs Autocad Architecture, Oasys GSA etc. (and, er, a lot of minecraft  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) with no problems whatsoever. Not every computer has to be a monster custom built gaming rig, especially if you can do without the hassle</p>

            <p>yeah but the barebone kits on newegg all seem to have super-ugly cases, either find a barebone kit on sale on tigerdirect or build it from scratch on newegg</p>
