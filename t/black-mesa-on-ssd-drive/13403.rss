    <title>Black Mesa on SSD drive</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-on-ssd-drive/13403</link>
    <description>From what I know, source mods must be installed in respective Steam subfolder so that Steam can notice and run them. But Black Mesa, consisting of a lot of small files, would probably load and run much faster on a SSD drive. So is it possible to install it to another location and still launch and play it?</description>

            <p>But My SSD drive is not big enough to house all my Steam games, it’s only 100 GB and a large portion of it is already occupied by Win7. So I wanted to know if it’s possible to install a single Steam mod somewhere else.</p>
