    <description>[u][COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Opposing Force 2[/u]

Alright everyone. Opposing Force 2 is at its slowest pace in a distinguished time. The team is not collaborating in such a way that would merit the title that what one might call a &quot;team&quot;. Right now mappers are prominent and timely for OF2. 

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Available positions are:

Audio Engineers:

Duty:
Compose highly realistic sounds.

Qualities: The ability to produce grungy, mechanical, or organic sounds that appropriately describe a mechanism, creature, etc.

Level Designers: Since the focus is urban, as in [COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Urban Chaos, it is fitting that a mapper understands travel between decayed and skeletonized buildings creatively. Environments include sewers, avenues, city scapes, etc.

Voice Actors:
Various voice actors for angry military type characters and scientists in a time of great upheaval.

Environmental artists:
Must be able to design buildings relative to the Arizonian setting of Rookstad. This will include office buildings, apartments, signs, billboards.

Destroyed, american vehicles are also in demand here.

Animators: 
Needed for environmental/cinematic animations such as falling debris from buildings.

Keep in mind that this is volunteer work.

[COLOR=&#39;DarkOrange&#39;][i]If you wish to replace or redo any previous works of existing members, please ask these specific team members. After updating the mod content to the latest version, modified files will take precedent and overwrite old files[/i].

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]To apply, send an application plus work samples/WIPs to [COLOR=&#39;DarkOrange&#39;]sirpownageorav3nger(AT)gmail.com (At for anti-spam)</description>
