    <description>Im just geting word out about this mod, because i played it, and then played it again on hard because it was so much fun. The mod actually takes place during the time of episode 1 and is actually made well enough that you could consider it cannon with the half life story! 

There is a sequel currently being made also and I cant wait for it. 

I hope you can enjoy this mod as much as i did  :slight_smile:

<p>Oddly, my father recently purchased a new computer, and I set him up with a game of HL2 on it, and provided I had it running on direct X 9.0 and HDR on and not 8.1 everything looked pretty decent. I still have the fullbright problems when I’m running it in 8.1 with HDR off.</p>
<p>It just occurred to me that this should probably be merged into the general “Mods” thread that is running around somewhere.</p>

<p>Oddly, I never noticed any major bugs when i played Rock 24. Unless you’re talking about when you play it through Synergy. That was horrible. I felt the voice acting was adequate, if nothing special. I’ve certainly heard worse (awakening anyone?)<br>
I never really considered Rock 24 to be really be intended to be integrated into HL2. It didn’t use any of the scenes, locales, or even reference any event from the official games, so I didn’t mind if it deviated from any particular standard that HL2 set. Despite that, I felt it actually did a great job of the catching the proper feel of HL2 (except possibly for the gman and vort sequence, and the one cutscene that breaks you out of your character)</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I could have gone along with that as well if there was some consistency to it. Have more of those events at the beginning of the game. Like instead of having the skeletons just pop up at you, have them turn into flicker into zombies or even combine soldiers and attack you, but then flicker back to being just skeletons. Get rid of the doofy guy in the black clothes.</p>
<p>I suppose part of my problem might be that I played the original Dangerous World Demo. I really enjoyed the open ended exploration feel that it had. You started out in the middle of the map, and there were about 7 different directions you could go off in, and only about 3 of them were actually required. It set my expectations that the game would/should/could have been like that the whole way through, but then it just fell into an incredibly linear path with the occasional mental breakdown in the middle.</p>

            <p>I find it pretty strange that Dangerous World was released on my birthday. Other than that, I think it was a good mod overall, once you get past the bugs and other strange things - I wasn’t really bothered by its attempts to mimic F.E.A.R.</p>
<p>In the end, it didn’t piss me off even a quarter as much as Rock 24 did. With that mod, I finished it feeling bittersweet, after all the bugs, crappy voiceacting, confusing layout in general, and did I mention more bugs?</p>
<p>To me, Dangerous World ironically felt more integrated into the Half-Life universe than Rock 24 (I’ll simply pass off the horror moments as simple mental instability on Frank Harrison’s part. It’s not that far-fetched, considering what the Combine does to citizens on a daily basis.), and left me with that feeling of wanting to see it continued, much like MINERVA.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I thought they were entertaining too, but Dangerous world specifically went out of its way to reference scenes from HL2 and Episode 1,thereby establishing that it was intended to exist specifically within the HL2 universe. Maybe this is just my opinion, but if a mod wants to exist within a universe, then it should be following basic guidelines established by the games that established the universe.<br>
The guy in the black clothes was unnecessary, he could have easily been replaced with gman, it would have even made sense that if the Vorts were protecting Freeman and Alyx that gman would use his time elsewhere, instead of wasting it fruitlessly. The scene with the skeletons was just blatant shock value, and had a supernatural aspect that was distinctly lacking from the HL2 universe. There were a couple other issues like this, but I can’t even remember what they are right now.<br>
Ultimately, it just comes across a cheap, like the mod was deliberately trying to ride the coattails of the official games, and then it threw in those shock value scenes just to come across spooky and mysterious without any real thought about how those scenes would affect the overall feel of the game. It’s like the creator of the mod had excellent mapping and scripting skills, but no clue what type of story to tell or how to tell it.</p>

<p>What’s really disappointing was that the Demo for this mod, that only covered up to when you get the gravity gun, was all excellently done. Unfortunately production values took a sharp drop, as well as the entire mood of the mod, almost like it was picked up by someone else entirely.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, aside from me hating the story altogether, I had none of the problems mentioned above.</p>

            <p>I recently saw a runthrough of this, and I wasn’t really any more impressed than the person playing.  Like was said, for no good reason the creators kept injecting little stupid horror bits that just didn’t mesh well with anything else in the game, and lots of triggers just randomly don’t work, and things are usually in a stupid non-intuitive place, so it’s pretty easy for you to just waste hours trying to figure out a puzzle, when really you had accidentally gotten it already, but the triggers failed.</p>
<p>The overall message seemed to be that the creators understood visual design well, but had no clue how to design the gameplay, theme, and flow.</p>

            <p>I think it only opens up when you’ve killed all the manhacks, and sometimes one gets stuck above the roof so you can’t kill it.</p>

            <p>I’ve been spamming nades at the window and nothing happens, there is a hole that breaks open while I was spamming nades inside the room with the generator, it seems to open when you damage one of those machines on the back wall, which you can’t do without noclipping.</p>
