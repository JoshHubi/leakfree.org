    <title>CS:GO Avalible For Prepurchase</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cs-go-avalible-for-prepurchase/9134</link>
    <description>For those who are interested:
[url=&#39;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/&#39;]https://store.steampowered.com/app/1800/[/url]

It seems like Valve won&#39;t be letting you preload the the game but instead will let you download the beta version on August 14th.  Which I&#39;m assuming will be updated to the release version on launch date.

Oh, and if you preorder now, you can save 10%.

Anyone excited for this or are you underwhelmed/don&#39;t care?  I personally haven&#39;t been playing CS all that much but I want to get back into it.</description>

<p>Not really. The configuration options are annoying as hell because they seem to be incredibly inconsistent, and either crash the server, remove the server from the steam server list, or refuse to let people join.</p>
<p>That said, I’m pretty sure I’ve gotten it to the point where I have a more or less stable setup now, so that’s cool. Tested it with some friends already, but I haven’t done any huge stress testing on it as of yet.</p>

            <p>I think the reason they took out sprays was because they didn’t want people to get distracted. I’m not sure but it’s possible they bolted down everything because of complaints that physics objects got in the way of gameplay. But most likely it seems like an easy way to save on dynamic shadow rendering, if most of the shadows are light maps (because the object that casts the shadow can’t move) the dynamic shadows of the players is cheap to render.</p>

            <p>The majority was indeed handled by Hidden Path so no worries.  And the whole idea behind the pop-ups in the graphics settings is so non-advanced PC gamers understand what vertical sync, anti aliasing, multicore rendering, etc. are.  But yeah, they really don’t need to tell me every time.  Not that big of a deal though.  I mean, how much do you really plan on changing your graphics config?</p>

            <p>Im disapointed in cs:go…<br>
I actualy bought the game to see whats new in the engine couse i love source engine.<br>
Im not sure if it was a good idea to use portal 2 engine…<br>
its strange that source engine is famous becouse of its phisics and now they downgraded it , why are a lot of objects welded to the ground just like in portal 2 and nothing can move it???<br>
At the begining I almost cried in the lack of the old menu system, the options look like call of duty wich I hate and here is this annoying thing when u have to read what it dose before you set an advanced graphical option…its the same in cod, did they copy the idea from there?<br>
the only positive thing i found was the new dinamic shadows and new playermodels, but i found a very simular player model to cod too, with that skeleton face mask… why cant they add more retextures with bigger resolution to items/props?<br>
Btw there is a bug when you are ingame on a server and try to join to an other “community server” it just drops you back to the main menu…<br>
Its annoying too that you have read that theese community servers can use custom models you have to download blabla…<br>
and why you cant hit esc or cancel if the server is loading ?!<br>
and why i cant use anything in menu if i use -console lunch option?<br>
(If i do not write -console start parameter then i cant open it up with the binded key in the keyboard menu, but if i do write -console at luch options then the main menu bugs to the backbround and I cant click on anything)<br>
source has limitations but in my opinion they could have made it better just see garrysmod,vindictus,extreme dinosaurs or black mesa source  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  you can push theese limits way more up,</p>
<p>why did they forget their animation of the door handle what they already had in hl2?<br>
btw wooden doors are destructable and its a very nice update…<br>
the skybox is the same low quality on new maps<br>
When someone look at this picture:<br>
(and i would call this cheap. ( the price was actually cheap too )</p>

<p>most of the people expect this in the next moments</p>

<p>So I tried the new demolition map with bots to see if something happenes to the house when exploding or after exploding ( also i didnt found options for bots like how many you want to set or give em only kives or something )<br>
I was NOT able to blow up the house !.. I was trying it for half an hour with normal ai , but all the time it was CUTED OUT, becouse the bomb dont have time to explode , couse bots are coming and trying to defuse it and you have to kill em and when all the cts die the round its over and u dont see anything from the explosion, I also tried to kill my team mates so i can play and trick easy bots alone and this was the only methood to catch a split second of that the big black smoke…aroound the house…nothing more</p>

            <p>I hated the way the new crosshair looked, but loved the feedback it gave. Update today came with a traditional crosshair that has the same feedback. Fuckin’ awesome. Definitely liking this game more and more with every update.</p>

            <p>I find that at least in the time I played in the beta, if you played causal mode, there were a lot of people who sucked.  I like this separation of hardcore and causal because it made it a lot easier for me to get into CS and feel the flow.</p>
