    <description>New Max Payne 3 trailer released: 

 [url=&#39;https://www.nowgamer.com/news/1054478/max_payne_3_debut_trailer_live_at_five.html&#39;]https://www.nowgamer.com/news/1054478/max_payne_3_debut_trailer_live_at_five.html[/url]

I thought the first 2 games were fantastic, i just loved the gloomy atmosphere of the game and the story line and i hope this one will live up to that.

However its now set it Brazil instead of New York in the middle of a snow storm, im not sure this is the best location for the type of game its intended to be. What do you all think?</description>

            <p>Its odd, I would have usually really enjoyed these games!</p>
<p>However, I just found the first one really repetitive and the strange dream stuff you had really ruined it! I know it was telling a story, but it just didn’t fit well for me - soz</p>
<p>I gave the second a miss.</p>
<p>After seeing videos of the third, at first I thought it looked awful, but for some strange reason it is growing on me and I may give it a go when it comes down in price. It looks sort of ‘Die Hard’ and not so 'romance-y, tragic and depressing!</p>
<p>No offense intended to anybody, I certainly can see why people love these games, I thought I would be one, but just didn’t grab me…??</p>
<p>I can also see why fans of 1 and 2 are getting a little worried about the third, but as stated, it needs to move to something different, other wise it would be just another re-make??</p>

            <p>I’m a huge fan of the Max Payne games (and one of the main creators for a Max Payne mod). I was/am quite sceptical about a third installment and the new premise (initially it sounded like a joke -and also the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/18761/max-payne-3-coming-march-2012.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">sample(?) box art IS a joke</a>), but I think I am leaning towards a “so far so good” opinion.</p>
<p>I mostly liked what I saw in the new (and short) trailer, and they did intentionally put in a few callbacks to the original series. I would like to see gameplay videos but I know that now I am more interested than I was a few years ago. Also, it appears (to an outsider) that they certainly did not rush the game’s development, so that could be good.</p>

            <p>You selfish fucking idiots. Having the same setting for every game in a series is retarded boring.<br>
I like this. They made him a fat shit</p>

            <p>I heard a while ago it was going to be and brazil and that really put me off, the whole point of max payne was always, a film noir love story, the third just seems like clich´ed generic shoot but since were using max´s name might as well set it in middle of a snow storm ¬¬</p>
