    <description>OK first off i don&#39;t really know were i should of posted this Thread and i am sorry if its in the wrong spot, if it is tell me.
       My first thing i wanted to say was is there a way to shut off the Half-life Black Mesa HUD were you health ammo and other stuff is since i was thinking about making a video of black mesa.
       My second thing is does anyone know how to take off the Messages that come up in the beginning of the each chapter like when you start the game you get Welcome to Black Mesa... its the messages that come in see through gray.

I would like to turn them off to make my video look nice. If anyone has any info on it thank you very much.</description>
