    <title>Fake Factory v9.5 Is it Worth a Download?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fake-factory-v9-5-is-it-worth-a-download/338</link>
    <description>No question that Half-Life 2 is starting to show it&#39;s age (although I think the facial animations have yet to be surpassed by another game, mind you I haven&#39;t played many of the newer games), but as I was browsing Kotaku&#39;s numerous columns on Half-Life 2 I noticed their take on FFv9.5 and after watching the video was suitably impressed (moreso over the upgrades in the environments, not so much by the npc models, some of which are abhorred).

I&#39;m wondering if anyone here is running v9.5 and can tell me whether or not it&#39;s worth a download.  Another question is whether or not you can choose what you want upgraded (eg. The option to only have the environments updated and have the npc models remain the same).

I&#39;ll link to the Kotaku article for anyone who isn&#39;t familiar with the mod (there&#39;s a video montage of the upgrades).

I’ve tried it and it worked flawlessly (at least with the original Valve Models). The thing that still irks me is that some scenes in Half-Life 2 are screwed up in one way or another. (the teleporter’s “thingies” not rotating anymore, or Breen just turning his head when appearing in his office. The trains in “Route Kanal” not coming anymore…). But Half-Life 2 in the Orange Box engine looks great nonetheless  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Is all the music in CM 9.5 very orchestra and slow, or do they have some faster bits for more exciting sequences?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Soundtrack is pretty Epic and “Very Orchestral”, there are some faster ones though. The first thing I did was replace them with the Original anyway  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> , but I think I will give v10 a chance and a playthrough (the author invested much work into making the game a dynamic audio experience)</p>

<p>Which also basically sums up 80% of FPS. Congrats, you just made a general statement.</p>

            <p>Well, here we go, aside from the original Rainbow Six Ghost Recon games, I don’t think many games since have aspired to that level of realism in a game, and even then being jumped to the next surviving squad member took it out of the realism element.</p>
<p>You can only take realism in gameplay so far before it becomes a completely frustrating clusterfuck. (read: Call of Duty series and random recharging health level).</p>
