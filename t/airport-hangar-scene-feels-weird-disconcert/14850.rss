    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/airport-hangar-scene-feels-weird-disconcert/14850</link>
    <description>I like the hangar scene where I can play stealth with the security officer and the whole airport makes Black Mesa more complete as a facility on a desert. The  problem is, the airport is in the middle of a conflict zone. The military starts losing grip in the area (as suggested by the previous scene). Shouldn&#39;t the atmosphere be less relaxed?

To fix it, I suggest:

1.) More damage to the hangar building and the airfield in the background.
2.) Heavier military presence. This shows the army is trying hard to hold the sport, and it makes the stealth more needed.
3.) Have soldiers that feel like they are trying to hold down the spot.</description>

            <p>I think adding in a more HECU presence via decorations/scenic would fit in more appropriate. Maybe they could possibly add in active Ospreys and Harriers on the airfield (which you can see when you are in the room with the security guard). It would be nice to hear more radio transmission while you are attempting to sneak out, to also here what is going on around you.</p>

            <p>Well personally I think it’s a good thing that the guard wants to sneak around instead of fight.<br>
He’s the last guy with Lambda codes, if he bites it nobody can back up the science team. Which is probably why the devs put in a stealth section instead of a regular escort - give you something cool to do without risking getting him killed.<br>
Adding more grunts just increases the chance of a game over if they get alerted.</p>

            <p>think it would be nice to see a few more soldiers.</p>
<p>personally think we should see a soldier with an RPG here as a big threat, alert them and get shot by a rocket, would only fire one round then swap to a pistol or something but that one round would be enough to severely wound the player or if unlucky kill the guard ending the area. Having a heavy enemy would be enough to encurage stealth, while not requiring it. as all you would need to do is take out the RPG soldier first.</p>
<p>also I personally do not know why the soldiers are in the hanger, sure their is a copter in the hanger but no reason for the soldiers to be there. If it is their field command there would be more soldiers, but as it is it seems like a gaurd post that just happens to have a radio.</p>
<p>here is my full suggestion though doubt it would ever happen.</p>
<p>give the player an option of following the gaurds lead, or add taking on a moderate hecu force, for this I would suggest changing the room to look like a field command station, and adding more soldiers and gear in the room.</p>
<p>suggested lay out</p>
<p>near doors: 2 sand bag groups set to flank the room, neither is manned but both have .50 cals meaning if you go loud you are in a kill box</p>
<p>center: in teh center should be a entrenched area with the radio, some ammo boxes(infinite MP5+ grenade containers like in the hazard course mod). this area would have the commander and the dialog</p>
<p>elivator near where player enters: a .50 cal aimed into the room, un manned with some health near it (for the people wanting to go loud.</p>
<p>fuel truck area: several boxes looks like they where stacking supplies there.( little to no change)</p>
<p>copter: center it, and have 2 hecu grunts with out helmets, masks or armor working on it (pilots)</p>
<p>soldier numbers</p>
<p>near doors: 3, 2 on left side 1 on right.</p>
<p>center: 4, 2 commanders, 2 medics, one dead on a makeshift medical station.</p>
<p>copter: 2 pilots, one RPG soldier, said RPG soldier will only fire once before swapping to pistol. (only time a soldier is seen using an rpg before firing it)</p>
<p>room conditions: blow a hole in the celling, and make the door the soldiers leave through more secured, as well as have it actually open if you stealth, that way once you get through if you did not do combat you can loot the area for a good deal of ammo, health, and armor.</p>
<p>ways to take the room: 2</p>
<p>player can go with the coward of a guard and sneak around, leaving the group alive, or the player can get on the .50 cal and mow them down (or use their own guns). This makes it an optional hard fight, where the player can either sneak by or deal with the full force.</p>
<p>right now it just seems out of place, but that is more because of the numbers. Though I am betting it is more to make the guard look like a coward right now.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Maybe add some tanks parked outside or just dozen of HECU on airfield just like it was in HL2 when you saw a lot of combines near from the nexus?That will force you to think that it might be better to choose the stealth way instead of shooting those HECU because others can hear you outside and therefore you will be dead.</p>

            <p>My personal incentive to take the stealth route is hearing the marines’ dialogue, but yeah, I agree with you on that. Having a heavier military presence would also help increase the tension (even if there’s no real way to “fail” the stealth section).</p>

            <p>I realize that, it’s just that I’d like there to be more incentive to sneak around with the guard, as suggested in the OP.</p>

            <p>Sneaking around them was the guard’s idea. Gordon doesn’t have to agree. If you feel like it, you can just kick the marines’ asses. Game isn’t stopping you, this isn’t a CoD stealth scene.</p>

            <p>Yeah I have to agree. There were only like 3 or 4 HECU Marines there with standard weapons. By that time, Gordon has probably killed over two hundred of the bastards. It doesn’t really make sense to sneak around them with those few numbers, just blast right through them all the same.</p>

            <p>The only thing I found weird about the airport in the distance was its really weird looking Black Mesa logo on the buildings.</p>
<p><span class="spoiler"><br>
[attach=4940,none,1885][/attach]</span><br>
Looks really strange. I guess it has a low level of detail because it’s meant to be seen from afar, but I feel like a few more polygons wouldn’t have been too bad on performance…<br>
