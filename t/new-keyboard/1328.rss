    <title>New keyboard</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-keyboard/1328</link>
    <description>I have been looking around for a new keyboard. So far I haven&#39;t found anything that catches my eye, so I thought I&#39;d ask what you guys think. I want a gaming keyboard, but am not willing to spend tons of money to get the world&#39;s best keyboard, so as long as it will function for gaming I am happy. The biggest thing on my priority list is a black keyboard with a blue back lighting and pause/play etc. buttons. I have limited space so preferably not a really wide keyboard. I am hoping to spend around 50 bucks but I can go over that if it is necessary. Any suggestions appreciated.</description>

            <p>I prefer old chunky plastic keyboards with buttons like Stonehenge. But these are equally fabulous if you want class AND comfort:</p>

            <p>If I were you, I’d stick with something that’s comfortable to use, something that feels natural. I personally have a standard keyboard with unusual sensitivity (keys are easier to press than other keyboards’ keys).</p>

<p>I think expensive keyboards are stupid, my friend’s G15 died 3 times so far and we burned it down last time it broke because it was out of warranty, right now I’m using an OEM compaq keyboard (my friend has 20 of them brand new), it’s really awesome, good build quality and extra large keys, and it’s only 1cm thick even with the keys, that thing will probably last for 7 years like my last compaq keyboard, but you wouldn’t be interested in it because it’s not backlit.</p>

<p>Well, I had several expensives keyboards but I never had any problem with them.</p>

<p>Good choice, it’s really the best you can get for your budget.</p>

            <p>Never had any issues with my Gen1 G15, love it to pieces. Best keyboard I’ve ever owned!</p>
<p>With the release of the G19, G15s are rather cheap, so you might be able to find one on special.</p>

<p>I’m using a keyboard my buddy found in the dump. It’s actually really nice but it isn’t backlit and I gotta give it back to him.</p>
<p>Thanks, I’ll check those out.</p>
