    <description>I&#39;m doing some home renovations that require my system to be taken down and put away for a while. So I setup a VM on my work laptop. Get steam and Black Mesa installed fine, runs with no real problems, except...high brightness. When running BM and source sdk 2007. Both start fine then flash really bright for a bit then it&#39;s just too bright. I tried the settings below but no luck.

[url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/17798-In-Game-Brightness-Issues/&#39;]In-Game Brightness Issues[/url]

Laptop is a Lenovo T540p
i7-4700MQ 2.5GHz
16Gb RAM DDR3
Nvidia Geforce GT 730M
Win 7
WMware Player 6

Anyone else experience this? Anyone try to run it from a VM? My other system is old, running XP and runs it with no issues, other then it being a little slow to load.

I did some screen shots while running the SDK:

Normal:
