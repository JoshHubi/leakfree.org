    <title>Ye Olde Waffle Comic Frames</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ye-olde-waffle-comic-frames/1433</link>
    <description>So after returning here, and seeing that Leak-Free no longer exists, I dug through my old comics and deleted some of the old files that didn&#39;t really merit staying there - comics in progress, mostly. However, I saved some of the good ones. They don&#39;t have dialog, and I have no idea what is going on in any of them. However, they&#39;re somewhat entertaining (to me, at least) so I will be posting all of the good ones I can find in this thread. I liked doing these old comics - I was getting very, very good at posing but I couldn&#39;t edit worth a damn, so they weren&#39;t very high quality.

The first is a series featuring Jambo, apparantly doing... something in a prison.

This one, which I managed to pull out of the poses for Arctic Antics 12, was part of Jambo&#39;s acid trip across America.
