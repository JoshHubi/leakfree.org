    <title>Escape from Black Mesa - Single Player Mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/escape-from-black-mesa-single-player-mod/13105</link>
    <description>[b]Note:[/b] Everything below is super WIP and subject to change.

Okay, so I&#39;ve been working on this for a few weeks now, certain other people have already seen some of the progress, and I thought I would just go ahead an post it up here so I can post updates for the public to see on a regular basis.

This mod is a single player mod that gives you, the players, a whole new story to play through and a chance to see areas of the Black Mesa Research Facility that have never been seen before.

[b][u]Story So Far...[/u][/SIZE][/b]
You are Dr. Walter Bennett, a biophysicist in the Advanced Biological Research Lab. You wake to your alarm in your dormitory after having a strange dream about a man in a suit. After exploring the dormitories and greeting your colleagues, you board the tram to the research labs. On your way, however, there is a deep rumble from somewhere in the facility, suddenly strange yet familiar creatures begin appearing out of thin air all around you, the ceiling crumbles taking you inside the tram with it. After miraculously surviving the fall you must now find an HEV suit and escape the Black Mesa Research Facility or die.

[b][u]Major Obstacles to Overcome[/u][/SIZE][/b]
- Voices and Choreography - I&#39;m not anywhere near a stage where this is important yet, but it will be a must in the future.

Screenshots are of a super pre-alpha stage, everything is subject to change.

Now to be realistic, this will probably take me a long time to complete. There&#39;s no guarantees that I will complete this since I&#39;m just doing this in my spare time, and if it is completed I can&#39;t guarantee it will be good. So set sail for disappointment!

As a last note: If anyone has experience prop modelling for Source and you want to help, send me a PM with some examples.</description>

<p>Hi! I don’t want to disturb your plans for your mod but if my memory is right, in black mesa, when you meet Dr Kleiner for the first time (when the scientist explains you about the experience) the time is 9:03. But maybe in the original half life it wasn’t that. Anyway, this mod seems good.

<p>Maybe in Black Mesa that was the case, if so then I may leave it be. The 8:58 came from the original Half-Life manual.</p>

<p>Quick update so nobody thinks “OMG mod iz ded!”</p>
<p>First off, minor change to the story section. I originally specified that the player boards the 9:00 tram, however, this is no longer the case. After some research it seams the RC occurred at 8:58, that means it would have occurred before you even board the tram. Most likely it will be more like 8:55.</p>
<p>I’ve been working hard on a detailed design document, I’ve written several pages worth so far. Its boring and tedious, but its a necessity and it’s already given me a lot of great ideas and a much clearer picture of where I want to go with later areas.</p>
<p>On the mapping front I’ve been working on improving and detailing the first map some more, I don’t have anything new to show, but hopefully I will soon-ish.</p>

<p>What do you mean? BMS uses the same door model and skins as Half-Life 2 as far as I know. (I assume you’re talking about the rotating door model)</p>
<p>Although the one you see is BMS locked door model, it uses the same skins and can’t be used as a prop_door_rotating.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But when compiled in a world, it shows the HL2 door textures, not the BMS textures. I assume it’s different if you run the map in BMS. (Locked doors are also a thing.)</p>

            <p>What do you mean? BMS uses the same door model and skins as Half-Life 2 as far as I know. (I assume you’re talking about the rotating door model)</p>
<p>Although the one you see is BMS locked door model, it uses the same skins and can’t be used as a prop_door_rotating.</p>

            <p>I actually have a question. How did you replace the door skins with the BMS textures? I managed it the first time by sheer luck, but I now use a separate copy of common/Half-Life 2 for BMS mapping and it’s not working. I should probably just put the BMS assets back in the main folder.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Crypt! I definitely planned on fixing it, but didn’t know about making overlays tile.</p>

            <p>Tip: One thing I’m noticing about the last shot is that the white lines near the end of the platform are stretched. If you disable Texture Lock and then resize the overlay, it won’t stretch, and will instead loop seamlessly (assuming the texture is seamless of course, which that particular line is).</p>

<p>I’ll just add, it was pretty easy to miss that station at the beginning of Surface Tension, being an original addition by the Black Mesa devs. I guess they wanted to stick with the transit system map introduced in Blue Shift, which has a station serving the advanced labs/biodome complex atop Sector E. However, Sector E was easily the largest part of the facility with Mat. Trans., so placing a station in a new area within this location won’t be much of a bother. Most of all, just do what you want first. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Either way, I don’t think it will have any bearing on the story or layout. So I’ll just let anyone who plays it decide if they want it to be said station or not.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
