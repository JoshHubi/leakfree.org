    <title>Forget About Freeman Theme: Guitar Solo!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/forget-about-freeman-theme-guitar-solo/14848</link>
    <description>I originally had planned to do this much earlier, but i had no spark. Recently however, i had a eureka moment and something clicked, and i ended up creating this solo for the forget about freeman soundtrack

My middle finger actually has a blister right now from the repeated practicing of this solo. I tried to make it not sound like over-the-top guitar wankery, but still have it capture that &#39;epic&#39; feel that the main orchestral melody has. In a way it is sort of a dedication to the developers of this game. I really enjoy it as much as i enjoy the soundtrack and this particular one captured my attention when the mod was first released and i played the surface battle. You can tell how tired my fingers got because my bends go slightly sharp at the end   :smiley:</description>

<p>I like it, but I do think it’s gets a tad bit too simple for the second half. Just the basic melody at that point. But I suppose it does still sound good. Do you plan on doing any more?</p>

<p>Christ, ease up on the strings. You gotta be using crazy pressure if you’ve been playing long enough to be able to play the quicker parts that well but still get blisters.</p>

<p>I definitely plan on doing more BM soundtrack covers. For this one i decided to keep it a bit simple for the last repeat on the chorus cause i wanted to highlight this track’s motif; a lone soldier in an HEV suit shuffling his way across the base leaving dead soldiers in his wake in order to get to that one destination, the lamdba complex, the key destination to close nihilanths portal.</p>
<p>I originally decided to have that melody harmonized the second time around, but i wanted to keep a single lead to emphasize the melody’s struggle to a resolve and destination. Thanks for the feedback though. It is important to know these things if i want to improve my playing.</p>
<p>I plan to release an alternate version with a slightly different first half and harmonized second half that i originally planned to release, as well as a clean version too. The blister was due to me trying to nail it in one take, which took like 15 failed attempts. Whole tone and semitone bends can get to you sometimes.</p>
<p>To answer the question below, i can release the isoguitar stem, and even a track to put in the workshop too. Apparently black meaa uses .ogg files for soundtrack playback.</p>
<p>And if anyone one wants to do their take of the song, the chord progression is F#m7, D/F#, E/F#, and B/F#. If you want to make it easier, omit the F# from the last 3 chords and it changes to F#m7, Dmaj7, Esus2, and B</p>

            <p>Nice! Any thoughts about releasing the audio from the solo on it’s own, or integrated into the full track and put up on the workshop?</p>
