    <title>Game crashes with engine error every time when climbing a ladder in an elevator shaft</title>

    <description>Hello it&#39;s me again.

My game crashes every time I climb that long ladder in the elevator shaft a bit after i swam in the reactor&#39;s coolant.
[url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/hJw1Z.jpg&#39;]I&#39;m adding a screenshot[/url] to show where exactly my game crashes. I tried going through it quite a few times but the game will always crash and give me [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/g9Jdt.jpg&#39;]an error message[/url]

[code]Engine Error
Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer (38984 &gt; 32768) Tell a programmer to up VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE[/code]

I&#39;m also adding the minidump file for a couple of those crashes.
Hope it helps!
