    <title>Game keeps crashing.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-keeps-crashing/10029</link>
    <description>Im on area bm_c2a2c ive done the part where you drive the bigger train car with the km/h display on the screen which then shorts and you crash through a door and land in the water. Ive managed to get back upto the top but im now stuck where you have to walk down the track. You get to a corner with a blue door on the left just as i go past it shows the &quot;loading&quot; dialog and keeps crashing to desktop saying &quot;a problem has caused hl2.exe to close&quot;. (unable to get screenshot as game crashes before i can press f12).

Anyone else having this or know of a fix?

Thanks</description>

            <p>Hm, I honestly don’t know, perhaps try adding “-dxlevel  90” to the steam launch options.</p>
