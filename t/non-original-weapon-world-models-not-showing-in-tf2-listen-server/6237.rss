    <title>Non-Original Weapon World Models Not Showing in TF2 Listen Server.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/non-original-weapon-world-models-not-showing-in-tf2-listen-server/6237</link>
    <description>When I create a Listen server, I cannot see my friend&#39;s non-original weapons and he could not see mine. 

Another thing is, I cannot load my weapon\hat load out. It shows that I have the items in the equipped boxes but even after I kill myself or use the supplies locker it does not change to that load out. This bug does not apply to my friend.

Sorry if I am asking at the wrong place.</description>
