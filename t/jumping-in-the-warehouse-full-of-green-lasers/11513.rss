    <title>Jumping in the warehouse full of green lasers</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/jumping-in-the-warehouse-full-of-green-lasers/11513</link>
    <description>OK - I&#39;ve had enough..!

I&#39;ve literally attempted one jump over a waste height laser at the beginning 50 times. No matter what key I bind it to, whether I use my left or right hand on the keys, I fail and trigger the explosion.

The entire game has been the most awkward at movement I can recall. As I don&#39;t fall flat on my face in all of the other games I presume there&#39;s something wrong here. Now I know I&#39;ll get helpful advice of how lame it is and how I should just learn to jump, so let&#39;s skip that.

It&#39;s broken and I can&#39;t be bothered to play it any further. It&#39;s far from rewarding or enjoyable - I realised I was playing it so I&#39;d feel better when I stopped. There&#39;s a difference between &#39;difficulty&#39; and &#39;kludgy&#39;. This game is kludgy and awkward which can be mistaken for &#39;difficult&#39;. It&#39;s tough to make one that is all of tactile and responsive and difficult.

But with such an awkward jumping mechanic it&#39;s all the more annoying that there are so MANY minigames based on that. 

I don&#39;t really expect any solutions.. I just needed to type it out..

            <p>I hadn’t realised that I needed to hold the jump/crouch key once you’d used config to bind that more complex command. Once I held it rather than simply pressing it, things certainly improved. Thank you!</p>

<p>Understood! Sorry for that, honestly. I read in various threads from a lot of “headcrabs” that jumping is mentioned in numerous threads. Just didn’t want to blow up yet another thread about jumping.</p>

            <p>bbsiteuser, please don’t take things off the forum into PM or e-mail unless absolutely necessary.  The purpose of having a forum, is so others can read what happened that fixed it.  Nothing is more annoying than finding a forum thread via Google which doesn’t have a solution.</p>
<p>deepskydiver, maybe the game is not loading your config properly?  You could verify that it does by comparing the values of the settings specified in your config versus the one displayed in the in-game console.</p>

            <p>yo deepskydiver, that looks quite ok, even though I haven’t messed with the “bms_…”-vars myself. I think your problem is the position of the script within autoexec.cfg</p>
<h2>Here’s mine …</h2>
<p>exec config.cfg<br>
alias +jumpcrouch “+jump; wait 5; duckON”<br>
alias -jumpcrouch “wait 5; duckOFF; -jump”<br>
alias duckON “+duck”<br>
alias duckOFF “-duck”</p>
<p>//fix jump from crouch state<br>
alias +normalduck “+duck; alias duckON; alias duckOFF”<br>
alias -normalduck “-duck; alias duckON +duck; alias duckOFF -duck”</p>
<p>bind “space” “+jumpcrouch”<br>
bind “ctrl” “+normalduck”</p>
<p>alias “toggleReticle” “incrementvar hud_draw_fixed_reticle 0 1 1”<br>
bind “p” “toggleReticle”</p>
<h2>//exec threading.cfg</h2>
<p>As you can see, I first have BMS execute the regular config.cfg file AND THEN I shove in the jump-scripts.</p>
<p>If you have “exec config.cfg” AFTER your script the command “unbindall” (which is first line in config.cfg) and possible rebindings for the jump-key might push your code in autoexec.cfg beyond Xen.</p>
<p>Maybe you play around a bit or PM me or mail me and I will sure try to help you, coz this mod is da bomb! It rocks so much that I filed a request to the Universe to be reincarnated as cradle  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Thanks for all the constructive help - I’ve been a bit ticked off about it and I’m sure that showed. In my autoexec.cfg file what I now have is this:</p>
<p>bind “kp_ins” “+jumpcrouch”<br>
alias +jumpcrouch “+jump; wait 5; duckON”<br>
alias -jumpcrouch “wait 5; duckOFF; -jump”<br>
alias duckON “+duck”<br>
alias duckOFF “-duck”</p>
<p>bms_normal_jump_vertical_speed			“200”<br>
bms_normal_jump_crouch_vertical_speed		“200”</p>
<p>… but it makes no difference to what I had formerly, which was:</p>
<p>bind “kp_ins” “+jumpcrouch”<br>
alias “+jumpcrouch” “+jump; +duck;”<br>
alias “-jumpcrouch” “-jump; -duck;”</p>
<p>… still the same result.</p>
<p>I’ve gone past it by changing gravity. A cheat I know and jumping is still weird.</p>
<p>I had put it down to my incompetence a few weeks ago, but as it’s even happening with a single key press I feel less of an idiot. If not quite happy! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

from mgr.inz.player.</p>
<p>It has actually improved my jumping a lot. For some reason I also had severe difficulties with jumping - and my middle name is “Half Life 1” - but thx to mgr.inz.player’s script Gordon is now more of an “Antilope®” than an Interloper  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Movement can drive you wild, I know, Gordon sometimes feels like the G.Man has glued two bars of soap on his soles, but that has to do with the source engine. Hope you find  the above tweaks agreeable.</p>
<p>Edit: and keep the Spacebar pressed a bit when you use the script</p>

            <p>Hi deepskydiver,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your bad experience.</p>
<p>You have to crouch-jump.  Basically jumping while lifting your legs.  This is a mechanic not used in many games, but very prominent in the Half-Life series.  For a better explanation about the concept, see:  <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/crouch-jump/92-1492/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.giantbomb.com/crouch-jump/92-1492/</a></p>
<p>All you have to do is press jump and crouch together (but don’t crouch immediately, wait 'till you’re up in the air a little).</p>
<p>We’ve seen quite a few people complain about this.  Fact is that it’s a common thing in source games, especially in Half-Life.  There is lots of things to be said for Black Mesa adopting the crouch jump, there is also things to be said against the decision.  Either way, it may or may not get changed in future updates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the community has developed their own method of eliminating the need to crouch jump.  See this relevant thread:  <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13835" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=13835</a></p>
<p>I hope this’ll be of help to you when you try Black Mesa again. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>No … not that I’ve ever noticed (though I haven’t played HL2 on this PC, it was another). L4D for example is fine as it Portal and Portal 2. I get that it can’t be happening for everyone, but I’m just bewildered.</p>

            <p>Do you have the same problem with all the other source-based HL games? Because the movement mechanics in those are basically identical to Black Mesa. Unless there’s something strange about your game configuration or HID I don’t see why there would be a difference.</p>
