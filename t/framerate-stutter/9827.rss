    <description>First of all, awesome mod so far, the time and effort that&#39;s gone into this is amazing.  :slight_smile: 

But I&#39;m having trouble, whenever an NPC starts talking or music starts, I get quite a bad framerate. My laptop isn&#39;t exactly top of the line, but it runs EP2 on full with no issues. Is anyone else having the same problem or worked out a fix?</description>
