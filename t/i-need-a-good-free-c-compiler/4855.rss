    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/i-need-a-good-free-c-compiler/4855</link>
    <description>i don&#39;t have shit for cash and i need a compiler.

looked on Google found some but they looked complicated (i&#39;m super new to programming, so the less complicated the better)

call me a newfag, call me a moron. but if you know of one help a poor ass black brother out^_^

p.s. I&#39;m also having trouble getting a flowing water effect in the source mod im making so if you know how to do that I&#39;d thank you for it

Edit: i need it to link code lines automatically</description>

            <p>Devcpp is just a pile of junk, debugger needs debugging, autocompletion works like s***, it wasnt updated since 2004 and comes with old, heavily bugged version of mingw (yup, standard hasnt changed yet, but compilers need patching just like any software)<br>
Now on to C::B… Not such a pile of junk, but for some reason wouldnt let me debug anything once id deleted line with break on it, also used it mainly for java, so i guess its worth a shot. Still, I prefer VS 2k8, but its not like Im using 1/10th of capabilities, moar like 9/10th. It might look… crowded with options and stuff if youre new to programming, but most of big gamedev companies use it just for that reason. Oh, and it natively supports DX libs ;]</p>
<p>Sorry for any spelling/grammar errors, english is not my first language.</p>

            <p>lol… this thread quickly went into “my code editor is the best” mode.</p>
<p>If you are just starting out and learning programming it doesn’t really matter what you use as long as it produces working executable. You don’t need THE BEST at all. just something that lets you code and compile. Dev-C++ seems to be doing just that. There are also the Express editions of Visual Studio which work well too.</p>
<p>In the case you want to produce software that others are going to use then you may have to seriously look into what compilers you use but most software today is either compiled with Microsoft’s compilers or GCC (in the case of Cygwin or MinGW32 based software). Some software even use Intel compilers for special optimizations but it doesn’t really matter that much. For games and especially games using DirectX you are better off sticking to Microsoft’s compiler and libraries.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually, Dev-C++ supports that as well.  It can index header files into a class browser, which can help you find certain classes/functions and can also do code completion.  It shows the prototype of a function as a tooltip above the code, just like Visual C++ does. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As I said, I’m not an advocate for the software and I personally don’t use it anymore since Microsoft Visual C++ Express came around, but Dev-C++ isn’t as bad as you guys make it out to be here.</p>

<p>I’m not a Source modder, so I can’t really help you with this, but you should Google a bit on the subject.  There seem to be a lot of tutorials about flowing water in the Source engine.</p>

<p>The age of an IDE and the features that it does or doesn’t have aren’t necessarily related, especially not when it comes to a programming language that hasn’t been updated since 2003.  If I translate your point to the Half-Life universe, you’re basically saying “The first Half-Life is old and therefor it doesn’t have good features”.  I think you and I both know that that isn’t the case. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Saying something is bad just because it is old, is a nonsense argument.  If you’d post a list of features that are missing in Dev-C++ which you think are vital to being a good IDE, that would be good information and I think it would make a nice read. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Either way, the bottom line is that I wasn’t telling you that you <span class="bbcode-i">have</span> to use one IDE or another.  You are, of course, free to pick whatever IDE you prefer.</p>
<p>My personal preference is Microsoft Visual C++ Express, by the way.  I’ve used Dev-C++ as well and I think it’s a very decent IDE.  It was a great alternative to Microsoft Visual C++ back in the day when there was no free C++ IDE from Microsoft.  Since there are Express versions of the Visual C++ software, I haven’t felt the need to venture outside of that for my programming needs.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You make a good point, but consider that many people TODAY would not like Half-Life, because compared to newer games there are far fewer people telling you where to go, the storyline is, while new and refreshing in that day, completely nonsensical today, the graphics are difficult to contend with for some, etc. For people just starting out, it’s not quite as impressive a tutorial to FPS gaming.</p>
<p>This parallels to IDE’s. If I had started with a more manual text-editing thing like Notepad++ or Dev-C++, I’m pretty sure I would have given up; call the newer ones “Assisted tools for newbies”, but that’s perfectly fitting for me. When I’m worming through an API I’ve never used before, I don’t want to get the object types and method call names (do they use underscores or camel case? two parameters or one?) from documentation online somewhere. That’s why such intuitive IntelliSense like in the Visual Studio programs is such a godsend for me. Plus, I actually have a lot of CPU and RAM I can use, so if it’s bloated that’s fine by me.</p>
<p>PS. Visual Studio provides a lot of Windows-specialized startup projects. Most of the time, you’ll want to look for the one that gives you native code and no pre-made classes.</p>

<p>There’s a version which comes with MinGW, but the last time I checked I had to update most of the stuff myself to get it work (some dependancies were somehow lost and it refused to compile some perfectly fine c++ code). So until this day I set up the the compiler suite myself.</p>
<p>But maybe this has changed and by all means you can try that  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>i don’t have shit for cash and i need a compiler.</p>
<p>looked on Google found some but they looked complicated (i’m super new to programming, so the less complicated the better)</p>
<p>call me a newfag, call me a moron. but if you know of one help a poor ass black brother out^_^</p>
<p>p.s. I’m also having trouble getting a flowing water effect in the source mod im making so if you know how to do that I’d thank you for it</p>
<p>Edit: i need it to link code lines automatically</p>
