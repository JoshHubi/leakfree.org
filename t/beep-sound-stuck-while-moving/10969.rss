    <title>&quot;beep&quot; sound &amp; stuck while moving</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/beep-sound-stuck-while-moving/10969</link>
    <description>I tried to browse all the FAQ but none has addressed the issue I have encountered.

Problem:
After sometime of smooth gameplay, I will encounter weird respond from the game. When I tried to move &quot;a w s d&quot;, I wont be able to move and at the same time there is a &quot;beep&quot; sound continue as long as I hold the &quot;awsd&quot; button without lifting. 

The only way I can solve this is to reload the game.. but after a while the same problem happened again.. Any idea ? Thanks!


The first problem I have is annoying lagspikes with my quad i7 (8 threads) + quadro card. Tried all kind of ways but I finally fixed the problem by just update to the latest driver as suggested by one of the member.</description>

<p>No solution know so far. Reported to also affect other Source-base games and mods (Garry’s Mod being one example). Please post your hardware/software specs as per bug reporting guidelines. Include all possible info about input hardware you have (i.e. keyboard, mouse, joysticks and so on) and software that could posisbly interact with input processing (Radmin, VNC, RDP, Synergy, TeamViewer, e.t.c.).</p>

<p>Thanks… I Just found one of these after I posted. I have posted my hardware specs in the above thread but have not been posted yet. Wish there is a solution soon.</p>
