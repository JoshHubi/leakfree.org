    <title>PC Building help needed</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pc-building-help-needed/7720</link>
    <description>After my second laptop started blowing out from rendering a model I decided it was time to get an actual desktop. Thing is, I have no idea how to build one. I could ask my techie friend to help me do the building, but as for the components...I need your help.

My budget is around $600-$700 (with a ceiling of 1k, but let&#39;s not go there); needs are:
-CAD and 3D modeling programs, ie. 3ds, Autocad, Unity
-rendering complex 3D models (fast rendering times a must)
-word processing, note taking
-gaming (preferably things like GTA4 or BF3 with no lag at reasonably high detail)

            <p>I can’t think of any reasons why they wouldn’t both run in the same case.  The software/drivers may or may not have some conflicts, but I doubt the hardware will.</p>
<p>The real question is, how will Windows take it?  I have no idea.</p>

            <p>You’re going to pair an nvidia gpu… with an AMD gpu?  And for ten bucks more, you want the 560.  It draws less power and runs cooler and quieter.</p>

            <p>Alright - I’ve decided I’ll go with a 460 or 560, but don’t know which one. Here are the candidates:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125333" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814125333</a><br>

<p>Would either of these run well paired with an HD 6850?  Any problems you might see, in terms of heat generation or power demands?  Thanks, this really helps.</p>

<p>Everything looks pretty good. I would however at least match (in price) or pay just a tad more for Corsair or Kingston memory. You could never go wrong there  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, you can <span class="bbcode-u">definitely</span> go wrong there.</p>
<p>There are a confusing number of options for memory. The vast majority are quite diverse in what they package and sell as being “their memory”. In reality, there is only ONE supplier in the U.S. that actually manufacturers their own memory and that is Micron. Everyone else is simply a re-distributor or assembler and that includes Corsair and Kingston. I’ve seen crap chips from BOTH of them. Unless you’ve been in the memory distribution and assembly industry you never really know what it is you’re getting.</p>
<p>The SAFEST bet for typical end users is to turn to Crucial Memory. Crucial is a division of Micron and has the highest percentage of quality chips used in their retail distribution. That doesn’t mean you’re always going to get Micron chips, but it does mean that their testing process is superior to the vast majority of other makes.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure if it’d work on not, but surely a GTX460 would be better value than a 260?</p>
<p>I’ve got a 460 myself and it’s a brilliant card, however you’d probably need to check the current pricing (looking at here in the UK, the 460 is about £120 whereas the 260 is between £100 to £155 somehow haha).</p>
<p>Also, depending on the benchmark test and the rest of your system, the 460 may beat the 6850 for gameplay. Then again, I’ve always preferred nVidia so I’m slightly biased  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I hate to revive the rotting dead (well it hasn’t really been that long, 8 months?), but it seems that you, Siggs, is right. A render program, Octane Render, would really speed things up with my projects but requires a CUDA card. Right now I’m hoping that I can install a new GTX 260 card with my existing HD6850, and have the program run on that. Would this work? Refer to my last list of components (last post on first page); if anyone has experience with Octane, feel free to interject. It seems like a really good program, photorealistic, gorgeous, and really fast.</p>

            <p>A late call, but I also second the motion to go with an nVidia card. I have a ATI, but I freely admit the nVidia’s are better at rendering. I dunno what programs you use, but I use  Bunkspeed Shot and Autodesk Showcase, and both have advantages when using a CUDA gpu</p>

            <p>Batz, when using 3D software like Maya or 3DS Max, the GPU doesn’t render, it is only needed for displaying what is in the 3D program as you are using it. When you render a scene or a model, it only utilizes the RAM and CPU. Some software however, does utilize GPU rendering, but I doubt he’d be using it since he’s asking for help on hardware.</p>
<p>And I had mentioned not to worry about video THAT much unless he’s going to be gaming a lot.</p>

            <p>Rendering = CPU + RAM + GPU.  As I said above, I’d recommend an nVidia GPU over an ATI in this situation for the CUDA cores (for gaming, I’d say ATI has the slightest edge depending on your price point).  And I give a +1 to G.SKill, have used them for several builds and can’t complain at all.  I had to send a kit back once due to a faulty module - their support actually sent me a replacement, free shipping, without even verifying that I had a faulty kit, AND included a pre-paid return package.</p>

<p>Vengeance is pretty ace. I went from OZ to that package (16G) when it was on sale too. Better responses during testing.</p>

            <p>Looking pretty good.  Just be aware that that motherboard has a Micro ATX form factor, so you’ll need to buy a case that’s able to fit it.</p>

            <p>After a bit of searching around I came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371044" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817371044</a><br>

<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115072" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115072</a><br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131712" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131712</a><br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231422" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231422</a><br>
<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136939" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136939</a></p>
<p>How does that sound?  Opinions, concerns, suggestions welcome.  And if there’s anything missing (besides the case) let me know.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you guys know of any cheaper alternatives to the components listed above (especially the damned expensive HD6950) please share.</p>
