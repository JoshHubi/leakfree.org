    <title>Fable 1 on XBOX 360</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fable-1-on-xbox-360/6905</link>
    <description>I&#39;m considering of buying Fable 1 on XBOX Live so my little brother can play it on the XBOX 360. I know that these games use software emulation and so aren&#39;t 100% compatible, and I&#39;ve heard different people say different things about how playable this game is on the XBOX 360.

But does anyone here actually have the original Fable 1 on XBOX 360 (not The Lost Chapters because this is reportedly even more glitchy), could you tell me if this game is still playable and what kind of glitches I should expect?

Please also mention if you have the disc version or XBLA version, and whether you have the PAL version or not.</description>

<p>Xbox Arcade version is like the original version but it was designed to work specifically with the xbox 360. Shouldn’t have any major problems with any XBLA title.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, with all of the XBLA versions of Xbox 1 games, they run pretty much the same since they just ripped the disc and packaged it to run on the 360.  San Andreas occasionally has problems rendering the world (go into the gym near CJ’s house and marvel at the world falling off into nothingness) but is fairly solid other than that, from what I’ve seen. (this is the DL version, not the disc version, I have NFC how the disc version runs on a 360)</p>
<p>I haven’t played the original Fable on my 360, but TLC seems to run fine from what I’ve played.  It has a bit of slowdown here and there, but everything worked when I was playing it.  US version.</p>

            <p>No an old friend of mine purchased it and shortly thereafter lost his computer to a series of bsods, so he told me to avoid it. I didn’t think much back then and didn’t even think about what i was asking. I did torrent it as I have it on the Xbox and it worked wonderfully.</p>

</aside>
<p>How could a commercially released game from a reputable company be full of viruses?</p>

            <p>I probably should have mentioned that it will freeze every once in a while, but it did that on original hardware anyway. It only happens when you play for like, 5 hours straight anyway.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the ending for Fable 1 basically breaks the game. I won’t reveal much, but major locations are inaccessible. Fable TLC doesn’t work too badly on the 360 anyway.</p>

            <p>I have the XBLA version, played through a couple of times and no serious glitching for me, at least nothing that stopped me playing the game altogether.
