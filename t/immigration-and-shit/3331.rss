            <p>It’s quite simple, because of cheap labor and lack of worker protections, Mexican workers produce goods more cheaply than US workers. Because of NAFTA, American companies can outsource production to cheap Mexican labor. This has the effect of A) screwing up the Mexican economy because they are all production and no consumption. B) making Mexican workers want to work in the US for higher wages, C) screwing up the US economy because we don’t produce anything, so immigrants have nowhere to work when they get here.</p>
<p>Obvious solution - penalties on companies for outsourcing labor, making it economical to produce domestically, which is what NAFTA eliminated.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Germany is the only Nation in Europe that lets in large numbers of immigrants, and that only because WE HAVE TO.</p>
<p>We are the evil children of Nazis, remember? So we have to do whatever those that were once allied against us ask of us. It’s part of our unconditional capitulation from back in 1945.</p>
<p>All other countries - France, Great Britain, Austria, Italy… restrict immigration much more heavily than Germany. As do the USA. Don’t even start to talk about Switzerland.</p>
<p>And German politicians would LOVE to do that as well. They simply cannot. They MUST let them in. Otherwise we are “ze evil dshermans” again.</p>
<p>Face it: Every “democratic” government with values of freedom and equality on this planet IS (!) hypocritical.</p>

            <p>Apparently no one read the quote in the OP. Only nutsack said something along those lines.</p>
<p>And I agree with him. The concept of illegal immigrants is backwards and elitist to the extreme, in my opinion. Any “democratic” government with values of freedom and equality would be completely hypocritical to refuse to allow people in.<br>
People have migrated for as long as the human race has existed, and only in the past few hundred years we have started refusing people entrance.</p>
<p>There’s only a tiny percentage of migrants actually coming to the west, anyway.</p>

            <p>I like how a couple of people’s racist undertones actually manage to pop up a bit.</p>
<p>But yeah illegal immigration is, well illegal. I haven’t met any but I’m sure they are people too and not stereotypical “fencejumpers”. I don’t have much to say on the topic since I don’t know much about it but that’s my 0.002 cents.</p>

            <p>Rather than fine businesses even, why don’t we improve the whole immigration process?</p>
<p>lets make it so that the people who deserve to be legal immigrants actually manage to get into the US  legally without having to wait 5 years for a friggin court procedure that may or may not even allow them to get in… the immigration process atm is ridiculous.</p>

            <p>I’m reminded of something that happened to John McCain on the campaign trail.  He claimed that immigrants do jobs that Americans don’t want to do.  He said something along the lines of, “I couldn’t get an American to pick apples, even at $50/hour.”   Right after he said that, his office was bombarded with calls from Americans that wanted to pick apples for John McCain for $50/hour.</p>
<p>I never laughed so hard in my life.</p>
<p>My view on illegal immigration is that it is a symptom of a problem.  Treating the symptom does not solve the problem.  My plan to solve the problem of illegal immigration would be dismissed with either laughter or anger by those that claim to hate illegal immigration:  Heavily prosecute businesses and people that hire illegal immigrants.  And I do mean heavily.  If a business is found to be employing illegal labor, they’re automatically fined $5,000 a day…per person.  If they don’t stop the practice of illegal labor, their business license is revoked.</p>
