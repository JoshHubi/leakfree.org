Being the Half Life 1 veteran that I am on map &quot;On_A_Rail,&quot; I knew if I drove the train up to the lift platform I would be pulverized.  So my cunning plan was to stop the train just before the platform, take the ladder to the top taking out the turrets with grenades, climb back down and jump on the train while permitting my evil laugh, muahahaha or so I thought.  Went to jump on the train and all that remains of it is the lights, see screen shot.  To my surprise, i&#39;ve found a bug in the game.  It is worth mentioning I heard the lift mechanism engage as I worked my way down the ladder.</description>

            <p>I think in the original, you had the choice to either let the tram go up without you or to ride it yourself just as we had here. But with the original you had grunts following the lift up trying to tag you. This version may be hard right now, but I think I was hoping for moving targets to be honest.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should suggest this to the team for the next update?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  What says the peanut gallery?</p>

<p>I think you are going to need to do that whole thing over and be sure to bring the tram with you. Before it goes up tho, jump off and let it go up by itself.</p>
