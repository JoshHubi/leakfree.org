    <title>Stripped screw on my laptop</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stripped-screw-on-my-laptop/4875</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having some overheating problems lately, especially in games and other 3D applications. Usually I can quell this momentarily by putting a freezable lunch cooler under my computer, but it&#39;s been getting so bad that even that&#39;s not helping. So I figure I&#39;d unscrew the part of under my laptop that unscrews, and as I went to do so, I realized that one of my screws has a stripped head. So my question would be, do any of you know how to remove a stripped screw that small? I don&#39;t have an extractor that would fit that tiny screw.</description>

            <p>Yeah, after making several attempts at removing the screw, I got scared and figured it was probably best to just leave it alone for now so I don’t screw anything up too bad.</p>

<p>Be careful with drilling out screws, you don’t want to ruin your laptop by using too big of a drill bit. If you don’t have a Dremel tool, get a screw extractor kit; you can get a set of extractor bits and a t-handle screwdriver (yes the t-handle is important) at home depot for around $15 and do the removal by hand. Not quite free, but much better than paying for a new computer!</p>

<p>I will definitely look into this! Thanks  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I hooked up the only USB fan I have and it’s working wonders. This will tide me over as I put off fixing the screw… :\ It’s freaking frustrating that they don’t use high-quality screws on these laptops. Maybe it’s just a problem with Gateway, but I’ve had plastic toys with better quality screws than this computer that was significantly more expensive :hmph:</p>

<p>You don’t know what it’s like where I live, man.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the suggestions. I’ll try drilling it out. I wonder if I have a bit that small…</p>

<p>But yea, try drilling it out, and replace it and/or tape it closed from now on and/or be very gentle with it from now on.</p>
