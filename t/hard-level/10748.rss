    <title>Hard level</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hard-level/10748</link>
    <description>Hi,
I have no problem to pass Black Mesa in normal level (w/o any balancing mod) and I in most time got 100hp and some armor,
So I tried to pass BMS in hard level, sometimes its very hard (specially assassin).
So if U finally update BMS (Zen map etc, could u make enemies weaker or strongest weapons on hard mode)??</description>

            <p>I have to say…hard is frickin’ hard. If you try to take out Marines at long range, you run out of ammo. If you take on Marines at close range, they can kill you in one clip, even with 100/100. I may start over on normal, just so I don’t have to be almost perfect the whole damn time. Still an amazing game, though.</p>

            <ul>
<li>In fact I feel that assassins are few and weak even on hard mode. Though no doubt they’re sexy  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  and each kick from them feels like a privilage. Headcrabs and zombies are perfect, maybe the vortigaunts should be a little stronger too, as for the Itchyosaur (or what) think that beast should’ve 3-4 times more hp at least, to become a challange. A clip from a pistol is enough to kill him.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marines on the other hand are sharpshooters even with shotgun, and they shoot at us even while side running.</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes the fight hard against them is that the MP5 is basicly useless in close encounters, and the shotgun, well… it takes too long for the shotgun to fire, if we hit the button, while reloading… and marines love to attack while we are reloading.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think hard mode is fine tbh, hard mode has been my first playthrough (just finished) as I can play slow and calculating and reloading areas (my next runs I play on a weaker difficulty, so I can feel like a bad ass). and the assassins are meant to be amazingly hard… put those satchels/trip mines/rockets to use, use choke points for normal weapons, you are the mouse, not the cat… just they way I see it</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s a really good idea. Don’t know why I never used those mines against assassins. That would make encounters with them a lot easier  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I usually play games on Hard and expect it to be challenging but in BM it requires learning the area and enemy placement to progress through each section which means repeated quicksave &amp; loading (Especially once the soldiers arrive). Enemy fire kills you incredibly quickly even with 100 / 100 health.</p>
<p>but Ive been playing BM from the start on Hard and so far managed to make it to the Apprehension chapter.</p>

            <p>yeah, but hard mose should be hard in all game, not hard in only some levels , and easy in other…<br>
Killing assasisn in hard mode w/o armor is rly hard. Killing zombies / headcrab in beginning is too easy.</p>

<p>I know right. Hard mode is fine.  There are other things to worry about. Complaining about hard mode is ridiculous.</p>

            <p>He want hard mode to be better balanced… like few more ppl do. I’ve made topic about it today <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14131" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14131</a> They should really balance few weapons, enemies and sequences in game. But you can do some magic with skill.cfg file. Made few changes and game is now a lot more enjoyable.</p>
