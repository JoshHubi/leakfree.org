<p>Just find a way to reduce that nuclear glow over the tables, get rid of the checkerboard floor tiles under the tables in place of the regular concrete tiles being used and maybe reskin the chairs for the models to be all grey or black if you can. That way you wouldn’t have to change much, but it would blend in better with the environment.</p>
<p>And on the offices issue:<br>
I might be wrong on this, but I don’t think you had to go through them in Half-Life and could just bypass them entirely.</p>
<p>Normally i’d give an outright no to forcing the player to go through those areas, but seeing so much work put into it I might have to agree with it. It would suck to do all of that work and have it go unnoticed.</p>

          <p>random notes an suggestions after watching video</p>
<ol>
<li>the MP5 grenade is used by the hecu once in black mesa, they use it to blast the engine of your tram. you could use that code only have the soldier miss.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.you could probibly use a scientist to guide the player to the security station (a female scientist would be best as they don’t have much of a role in the game).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>in the security station put a cammera aimed at the 2 block aids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you could explain the blockades by making it a security check point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>on your design delima area, you should be able to go by foot as msot players would hate to back track, suggestion is to put a tram on a side area(path collapsed), that can be accesed by the player only once the check point is open and the door for it is open(the security station before that).</p>
<p>minor suggestion, add some alive scientists and guards in the later maps, to show that they are holding out some against the hecu(part of the story is that the guards and scientists started giving the hecu grunts some problems that’s why they where allowed tanks and bombers in later levels)</p>
<p>area suggestion based on that, a security room that the player must pass through that has 3 guards and 2 scientists in it,(guards armed 2 revolver 1 mp5(yes they can use them)), the player must activate a way forward but doing so also allows in a large force of hecu which the player can hold off with the survivors or just run from.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>you could make the electric part clear by replacing the electric with radioactive goop and having a sign saying encase or radiation leak, use tram. the radioactive material would need to lower and there would need to be a pipe and a side path that is unusable do to the leak.</p>

          <p>The other tram at the end of the map is a good idea but also what you can do (and someone has mentioned it already) is to connet the the 2 floors with a staircase, near the security station. Looking at your video, if the door at frame  16:00 and the doors at 19:47 can be connected with a staircase it allows players to go directly back to the tram. Ofcourse have them locked when you first enter the office complex, only after travel through the complex and you flick the switch to unlock the toll gates do a couple of grunts come through those doors giving players a choice of allowing you to go directly back down to the tram, preventing back tracking problems but with your later tram allowing players to continue at will.</p>

<p>Thats used on the last level of OaR and the grunt uses an RPG, not an mp5 gernade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HECU have already done their sweep through the offices, killing everyone, hence all the dead bodies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a camra screen it was just really hard to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sorta is a checkpoint did you see the 50cal at the begining.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also im not sure where you got the idea the the BM personel are giving the military a run for their money, im pretty sure that its the aliens that do that. Did you see Text’s Surface Tension Uncut?</p>

<p>To refer to your comment earlier, the crates in the crane room are because the HECU have hidden a turret behind them. The Houndeyes’ sonic booms absolutely wreck the entire setup, though, I need to find a way to prevent that. It’s broken about 80% of the time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Can’t you use a trick similar to what they did in Portal? Assuming it’s possible on BM’s version of Source, anyway. Basically the crane room would be in a different part of the level, all the windows and the door would be portals that take you to and from the room. If done right, the transition would be flawless, and I don’t think the shockwave will affect anything in that room, but I’m not 100% sure. It’s not a solid idea because I don’t know if it’ll work, but it’s something you could look into.</p>

<p>Regarding the HECU vs Vort fight you can watch from under the grate, and that they can’t shoot you through it, leading to them seeming a bit stupid when you pop out… how about making the surviving HECUs regroup in an adjoining room or corridor immediately after the fight? You could add a line of speech to that effect, so it’s clear they’re following orders rather than being idiots.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it’s placement in this level is kind of arbitrary, it looks like it’d be easy to miss and it’s only there for the sake of being there. I would say remove it from this level and add it to one of the other 2 levels as a sort of ‘vent passage’ that the player must go through. As for the battle, you could have the Marines win against the vorts, then retreat from the area. That way they don’t end up running right up to the vents one by one to be killed.</p>

<p>One more thing… any chance we could have HECUs fighting zombies and headcrabs at some point? In Black Mesa you never see them in the same room at once (or not memorably, at least), it’s like they’re Clark Kent and Superman. Might be good to make this one of the first fights you come across, as they’re also the first enemies Gordon encounters, and including STU there are now quite a lot of HECU/Vort battles in the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh yes, I would really like to see this at some point. It hadn’t occured to me that the HECU never actually fight Zombies anywhere. I loved the Hospital scene in Episode 1 where the Combine were bogged down fighting hordes of Zombies, and think it would be really amazing if you could create a similar scene somewhere in this mod. I’m not sure if there’s any room for it in the offices seeing as you’ve already put a lot of work into the Vort / Houndeye fights, though. Part of me thinks those generic battles could be moved to another area (where else would a zombie battle go other than an office?), but the other part says that would be changing way too many things around.

I enjoyed seeing the HECU body get dragged into the room but noticed when you entered, his body was gibbed and in the back corner. what you should do is when rounding the corner into the room, you should have a zombie munching on him or even better have him munching on his head like when you see them doing to a scientist in UC.</p>

<p>I agree, it was weird seeing the body apparently vanished when he got around the corner. It should definitely be in there somewhere near the middle, with the zombies eating it.</p>

<p>Regarding the backtracking problem - I’ve pretty much solved it. I’ll have a tram stashed away in a side area near the end. also covered over by a boom gate or whatever they’re supposed to be called. It works perfectly. The player has to get to the security office to open everything up, but can also walk to the end of the level without having to backtrack.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I support this idea, but be careful with having more than one tram. I’m not sure how it works at all, but I know at the end of Power Up there’s a severe bug where trying to use both trams at once 'causes them both to deactivate. In this instance, such a bug would be game-breaking!</p>
<p>I’ll likely rewatch the video and do a more complete step by step review I’m alone later.</p>

          <p>Brilliant rendition Text - even in your brief video the level felt both brutal and eerie, something that the original Half-Life level could be summarised as being. The fight felt epic enough and very well implemented in that the player never feels as though all the enemies are after him but rather that he’s moving through a war zone.</p>
<p>I’m one of these people that actually really liked Half-Life’s OAR for its eerie desolate nature, and it’s something that BM never quite realised. The lighting for instance felt quite warm whereas in the original it felt markedly colder, adding to that unsettling abandoned and claustraphobic feeling. It also helped to distinguish it from Power Up and other chapters since it’s further underground, at least in my mind.</p>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<p>To be honest I felt the map was almost flawless in terms of design and difficulty. The flaws are mainly in BM’s department in terms of their design approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lighting feels too warm and frequent. Half-Life’s OAR is, at least in the first segment, eerie and cold. As the player descends it is dark, the place is flooded and the absolutely brilliant track ‘Sirens in the Distance’ can be heard. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SJaetdnoA" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_SJaetdnoA</a><br>
Other sounds are soon revealed, called something like thehorror01 - the player really believes he is descending into something utterly terrifying.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was lost in BM, and the lighting and mood are largely the same as Power Up. It feels too light. It is not a fault of yours to continue BM’s theme, but at least in the early stages I would love for the area to be dark, dingey and sinister. Don’t be afraid of pitch black areas or flashing/red lights - the player has an infinite flashlight, he can use it. You can reasonably suggest to the player that power has been lost in one area and fill it with headcrabs/zombies, or else nothing at all. An example of this in your work is the tunnel the player uses to observe the HECU fight; it would be more atmospheric to make it smaller and more cramped, filled with pipes. You could also get rid of the lights entirely.</p>
<p>Even later in your video the lighting feels like Office Complex or Power Up, whereas to my mind OAR was almost abandoned and never used except by security and maintenance to get from one end of the complex to the other with just a scattering of security stations. If you can perhaps soften the light, make it less intense and cool its colour it would be a big improvement in my eyes. In my head OAR could be similar to Questionable Ethics in mood, being eerie, abandoned and cold, except rough-cut, decrepit and industrial instead of clinical.</p>
<p>One of my favourite parts in your video was actually the room filled with zombies. This feel echoed Episode 1’s underground area, which could in turn provide inspiration for at least part of your rendition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I was also strongly reminded of a scene in Blue Shift which stuck in my head as a particularly powerful one, wherein the player walks into a pitch black room and turns on a light switch, revealing a massacred group of scientists. Perhaps in lieu of having your group of dead scientists in plain sight you could opt for this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would take away the cafeteria entirely, and reduce it to a small room with a few vending machines. I realise this is a departure from what you have already done, but to me the railway system is simply used to get from A to B by maintenance/security, since you already have the modern tram system for all the scientists. These security guards would not spend a sufficient amount of time there to warrant a whole cafeteria beyond just a few vending machines since they would be largely self-sufficient. And was there an office complex in Half-Life? I recall an area with bookcases but that was all - everywhere else seemed just storage. If I’m mistaken I apologise, but to my mind no one would want to hold a meeting half a mile underground. The whole place seems in service to all the industry above, nothing more. If you’re unwilling to redesign the office though, I understand, though I would say the cafe needs a rethink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems like you’ve already come up with a solution for the tram area at the end of the level. My first reaction was to make an optional puzzle for the player. If they get to that point and would rather not backtrack you could simply make them climb over the water in a manner similar to the bridge you cross in HL2 - over beams and catwalks above certain death. At the other end would be another tram. I’d love it if you worked that in somehow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I haven’t understated just how brilliant I think your work is. If I’m vocal about improvements it is only out of a desire to see OAR’s potential realised.</p>

I love some of your design decisions, too; they really do improve on the Half-Life original instead of just throwing it away.  I’m okay with forcing the player to backtrack a reasonably short distance to the tram, but I’m glad that you have an alternate tram available - because some players will likely have gone through the previous maps without a tram, and their tram will be several maps back.</p>

          <p>Just watched the video and figured I’d chime in.  Firstly, thanks again for doing this.  Every step that’s taken to fill out Black Mesa is another step towards making it even better, IMO.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding whether or not to require backtracking for that tram; I’d say definitely don’t do it for the larger version; as that’s not how it was in the original anyway and it’s going to be long enough without requiring backtracking.</p>
<p>For the shorter version, part of me figures you might as well require it, but part of me thinks that would take away from the point of the shorter version, so I dunno on that front.</p>
<p>Finally, and this is just my own interpretation on things, but should the office area look so…  freshly used?  The railway is supposed to be decommissioned, so I wonder how much they would actually use the surrounding office space at the point.  Though I could see that area having served another purpose at one point and just gotten repurposed to be an office space and cafeteria.</p>
<p>Anywho, the level looks great so far; looking forward to the next update!  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also, given that scenes.image needs to be recompiled every time you toss in another mod like this, have you given any thought on how you’re going to integrate them with your uncut version of Surface Tension?</p>

          <p>Looking fantastic! I sort of have to agree with Floyd here, for a decommissioned rail system, it’s looking very… used? What would all those scientists be doing down there, It doesn’t really seem like a research part of the facility, more a logistics and maintenance section. It felt kind of overpopulated in the video. Overall, the aesthetics are looking great, but don’t be afraid to diverge from BM’s lighting and go with that colder, dimmer lighting scheme that Floyd is talking about.</p>

          <p><span class="bbcode-b">Thoughts</span><br>
A1-A2 does grossly fit the general aesthetics of BMS OaR but needs some more work to bring it in line aesthetically w/dev work.</p>
<p>Why I think OaR Uncut vs Lite is stupid:<br>
-caters to stupid thinking.  Length is a non-issue…it’s all about content.  These people just don’t have the imagination to realize the possibilities of what can be done in the later sections.  I’ve got some pretty wicked ideas lined up for E-F too and some of the “filler” areas as you call it can be used to house some great storytelling scripts.<br>
-A lot of people don’t like OaR just because of the opening loop.  It’s poor design and counterintuitive rail switching element negatively skews their opinions of the entire chapter.  People just fail to realize their bias.<br>
-During testing, you will add ammo layouts for A1-A2 and B1-B2.  This ALREADY gives players the possibility to start at 2 places other than the beginning of the chapter.  If they want even more OaR light, just use the dev console and impulse 101.  Problem solved w/minimal work.<br>
-Do you honestly think that people will only play ½ of your work when there’s another ½ out there?  Fuck no.  More BMS=better BMS.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">General</span><br>
-Too many light fixtures throughout your maps…A1 tunnels would benefit from ~15% decrease in lights.  A2 lighting (office complex and toward BMS B ) needs to be decreased by ~33% and the cafeteria lighting is just bombastic.  Making these adjustments will let you play more w/light and shadows which will enhance the moodiness of your chapter.</p>
<p>-Some areas are too grungy while others are not.  This can be fixed over several iterations.</p>
<p>-Be very careful with enemy placements.  You’re pretty much using every enemy type in the office complex which can introduce canonicity issues.  The main groupings to avoid are as follows: vorts + hounds, vorts + squids.  It’s unclear what their relationships are and you shouldn’t be the one to make the ultimate judgement.  The interactions of every other combination can be deduced by referring to HL and using simple logic.</p>
<p>-The vort side of the office complex needs to be further developed.  Some of the HECU side can be ported here to not make the complex excessively massive.  This is important because you’re just mixing up the enemy types now.  W/2 sides, you can compartmentalize better (e.g. HECU side has vort+hound, vort side has vort+squid).</p>
<p>-Some questionable aesthetic choices in the office complex.  The main issues are the cafeteria and the seating area by the locker which are FAR too luxurious.  The OaR office complex is old, shitty and a depressing place to work in.  This ain’t the Office Complex chapter or QE where everything is cozy.  The aesthetics here need to be more in line w/BMS’s B.  Simply put, keep it simple, keep it Spartan.</p>
<p>-You can implement a fire sprinkler system throughout the office complex to make the squid placements make sense, as they are amphibious and are usually found near a water source.  Some of the sprinklers could be going off in certain rooms and the squids would preferentially be placed there.  This looks cool, especially w/their glistening skin plus it would obliquely (not realistically) explain some of the flooding in earlier parts of OaR.</p>
<p>-There MUST be a scene, whether here or in the D-G section, where a squid spits on some HECU.  It looks fucking glorious.</p>
<p>-You played through A1-A2 in a linear fashion.  New enemy spawns will need to be placed for a more backtracking play style but this issue can be dealt w/during alpha testing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A1</span><br>
There’s a time and a place for water and it’s on this map (NOT at the end of A2).  The water area preventing passage to BMS B can be ported here to replace the red door.  This area would be great as a partially flooded zone w/electrified water, which would explain the presence of bullsquids and why hounds can’t get on the tracks.  See my post on page 7 for how it could be done.</p>
<p>You should introduce the satchel charge here as this area is an amalgam of HL’s A/B2.  The “ammo theme” section of the pitch bible shows how to do it.  To add to that idea, you could cut the number of hounds by the crane so that you can pack more of them into the trap.  Also note the architecture at the end of HL B2 (by the bullsquid and elevator).  The arched layout here is almost IDEAL for the player to set a satchel/tripmine trap as it’s very forgiving if he fucks up.  He just needs a visual cue that the hounds are coming (e.g. video monitor).</p>
<p>The boxes attached to the crane are way too small for it…it will look better if the crane is picking something up that’s MASSIVE (i.e. greater than the surface area of the magnetic part).</p>
<p>You can also add the “Auto-Lux” lux logo above the “rail switch control” logo to keep in line w/the branding (I guess they are the manufacturers of the rail switch system).</p>
<p>If there’s more than one crane control lever, put them together w/the “crane controls” logo centered between the 2.  Otherwise rename logo to “crane control”</p>
<p>If possible, make the pair of bullsquids in the rocket room (and all other scripted melee squids) move 100% faster and then increase the distance between the soldiers to improve the visual effect.  They remind me of ambush predators that can move very quickly but only in short bursts.  In HL they were relatively fast (just a touch slower than hounds) and agile.  Here, they are slow and stupid.</p>
<p>The aesthetic focus of the rocket room should be the ROCKET…however instead it’s really the massive pipes in your map because the rocket is so small.  You can also hang the large rocket base from Blast Pit from the roof as well as another small rocket (like the one you already have).  This area could be themed as a rocket assembly room or some BS.  You can also make the large pipes a little smaller.</p>
<p>It makes no sense for there to be a power switch SOLELY for the crane…flipping the switch (maybe relabeled as “backup power” or “backup generator”)should also turn on ~2/3 of the lights in this area.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> A2</span><br>
At the marine ambush you can STILL keep the tram lift with just a little redesign.  See 7:54 on your video while reading this.  The square area where the marines and tram are located could function as a lift (perhaps you can reuse the design later in your B1-B2 to reinforce this element). When the player gets near it, have him see the marines moving UPWARD on the tram but BELOW the player.  Ultimately the lift will take the marines up so they can access the second floor secure access door (otherwise this door makes no sense).  If the player gets to the ambush quickly, he’ll have a strategic advantage because the marines are BELOW him.  If he gets there too slowly, he’ll be at a disadvantage because the marines are ABOVE him.  Aesthetically, you can also add some undeployed sentry turrets here.</p>
<p>Unless you are planning to edit Power Up, you should use the toll gate model from the end of this map to keep consistency (even though yours are nicer).</p>
<p>Use this for the ideal/most consistent office complex color scheme: floor 1 (yellow, like BMS B ), floor 2 (blue, like HL floor 2), floor 3 (red).</p>
<p>The door by the three batteries should be replaced w/an HECU power charger which dispenses 50 (since all BMS dispensers give 75).  Delete the 3 batteries.  Also delete the white markings along the walkway as it’s completely inconsistent w/the rest of the complex.</p>
<p>Re toll gate sign:  I don’t know if the gates are actually called “toll gates.”  I call them that because I don’t know what their actual name is.</p>
<p>I’m kinda of disappointed that you didn’t expand the vort side of the office complex.  It’s actually more underdeveloped here than it was in HL.  You can add just a couple of more rooms on that side or simply port some of the rooms on the HECU side there, which will make room for a better placement of the cafeteria (see discussion below).</p>
<p>“The Year of Death” is being used sub-optimally.  What would make this track more appropriate are the following: 1) ABSOLUTELY DARK LIGHTING (I’m thinking the vort room in the opening of C2A5G) w/only flickers illuminating scientist corpses.  Do this at least in the area where the track is going off…your complex is much too well lit it to work well.  MAKE the player use the flashlight here. 2) dead scientists…you need MORE just after the stairwell.  The execution scene can be ported a little further into the complex.  You could also make the scene more grizzly by inscribing on the wall in blood something like “you did this Freeman.”</p>
<p>Swap all floor 2-3 marines w/NVG marines once the lighting is dealt with.  It enhances the effect of “The Year of Death.”  Do a google image search of “Zero Dark Thirty” and you’ll see what I mean…the soldiers look like some otherworldy demons.</p>
<p>The signs in the complex are awful as you mentioned…don’t use the QE signs as a reference (they are utter shit).  Something a little grungier would be more appropriate here.</p>
<p>In the locker room, you could have your locker open and give a battery or something to signify that you’re the creator.  This is much more subtle than painting some vent w/graffiti like some poster suggested.  This is just unprofessional.</p>
<p>The seating area by the lockers is WAY too luxurious.</p>
<p>There is one more room type that you can add…something akin to a school nurse’s office.  This makes placement of a health charger w/in the complex make sense and the area could serve as the makeshift HECU hospital.</p>
<p>Have the squid in the women’s bathroom face you so it’s not stupid and easy to kill.  It’s cool for its spit to stain the walls.</p>
<p>Make sure the zombie dragging the scientist is correctly facing the player.</p>
<p>The room w/a pair of dead barneys (behind the tables) could have some armored vests lying around as a nod to Blue Shift (if the model exists).  The tables should be littered w/bullet holes.</p>
<p>The “rail security override panel” room needs to either provide a view of the toll gates or show them lifting on video.   Choice 1 is BY FAR the best option because it gives players a visual cue IMMEDIATELY on arrival to the office complex.  Remember, cause and effect.</p>
<p>Delete the gaps on floor 3 which allow you to see floor 2 in the area seen in 16 : 36 of your video.  There’s too many of them here which is unrealistic.  You’re basically introducing architectural pseudocomplexity.  Real architectural complexity, in my mind, is having the upper floors CROSSING THE TRACK and thereby linking the vort and HECU side from HL.  You should do more of that.  Some of the remaining gaps which you keep could be used to let the players see reinforcements coming in from the lower floors.</p>
<p>I really hate the cafeteria for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Location is completely illogical (see Arctic, Dadster arguments).  I agree 100%.  The best place for it would be nestled deep in the office complex AWAY from all the trams and dirt.  If you do this, you can displace several of the rooms of the office complex, which you can use to develop the vort side.  In HL, this area was a promenade that connected the vort side and HECU side across the tracks.  You should do that here to add architectural complexity.  This area is also prime for some cool physics.  For instance, you can have a pair of vorts clawing or shooting a marine off the ledge.</li>
<li>The lighting here is utterly bombastic…the office complex itself already has too many light fixtures relative to BMS but it really comes to a head here.</li>
<li>Size.  Way the hell too big for this office complex…the cafeteria can seat everyone and their grandmothers.  Realistically people working in office complexes take breaks at different times so the cafeteria should NOT seat everyone.  It should only seat ~1/2 the people.  The kitchen area in most office jobs is bare bones…just a sink, microwave and maybe an oven or dishwasher.  Keep your cafeteria simple, keep it Spartan.</li>
<li>Aesthetics…too cheerful.  OaR’s office complex is not a happy place to work…see the BMS B complex.  Pleasant is for the Office Complex chapter and QE.  OaR is fucking depressing and the aesthetics should reflect that…i.e. simple floor (no checkerboard), few if any plants, limited menu options, crappy chairs etc.  You should want to kill yourself after working here a few months.  As a side note, if you want to use more plants like some people are suggesting, keep it few…remember this isn’t exactly an ideal workplace.</li>
</ol>
<p>A thinner grill will look much better for the hidden area.  See the end of Inbound (Barney intro) or parts of LC for good references.  The HECU not reacting to you here is not a big deal.  Just rebalance it such that there’s only 1-2 survivors or tip it to the aliens favor.</p>
<p>Bare HL C area…some suggestions (as it does look pretty bad now):</p>
<ol>
<li>More office rooms…porting the cafeteria could displace some office rooms to the vort side, allowing you to develop it.  The large pipes from HL could be kept in spirit as tiny pipes running across the rooftop.</li>
<li>The ugly part of the office complex…i.e. storage areas, places where pipes converge, a furnace to heat up water, etc.</li>
<li>A security room (perhaps ported from the office complex or simply a new one) w/maps of OaR (nothing from F-G), like an info booth.  Pushing a button here unlocks the red door…there is a sign here (or possibly earlier in the map) that says something like “door only opens in proximity to tram.”  Aesthetically, I tend to favor this option….functionally, we’ll see.</li>
</ol>
<p>Set some of the tripmines a little lower.  They should cause damage to the player if they detonate on the tram, which is what you should be going for.</p>
<p>Again water should be in A1.  You can keep the barnacles if you want.  In the future, barnacle+electrified water=no no.</p>

<p>Looking fantastic! I sort of have to agree with Floyd here, for a decommissioned rail system, it’s looking very… used? What would all those scientists be doing down there, It doesn’t really seem like a research part of the facility, more a logistics and maintenance section. It felt kind of overpopulated in the video. Overall, the aesthetics are looking great, but don’t be afraid to diverge from BM’s lighting and go with that colder, dimmer lighting scheme that Floyd is talking about.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well you have to imagine that after We’ve Got Hostiles that the BM personel figured out that the military wasent there to save anybody, so everyone scattered to get away from them and now what we see in text’s maps are those that the tried to get away from the HECU. So yes the rail system is decommissioned but the bodies we see are from everyone forced down from the surface to escape the military’s cleansing operation.</p>
<p>On a sided note I vote THUMBS UP on having the cafeteria, I like it.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Just want to say one more thing to those who don’t like the cafeteria, just try to think that its a much older part of the facility. Its supposed to have strange design decisions. Maybe those that built it didn’t really think having a cafeteria next to the tracks was a problem. Maybe the rails were built after the cafeteria was there or vise versa. Its just a strange unique thing.</p>

<p>I knew were were hostile to people with opposing opinions, but wow. Calling people dumb because they have differing opinions is childish.

<p>Ignoring the fact that there is such a thing as a dumb reason for having an opinion is just politically correct nonsense.

          <p>After looking at the offices again, I think the lighting scheme for that area needs to be changed.<br>
Despite where they are, that entire area was obviously designed to look like it was still being actively used by people (despite it not really making any sense), yet it’s just as dark and… orange… as the train tunnels.</p>
<p>You might consider changing the lighting in the ‘office complex’ area to a cool blue or just a fluorescent white or something. Make it a brighter area than the tunnels so it doesn’t all look the same.</p>
<p>(But that’s just an opinion. Don’t know if anyone else agrees)</p>
<p>And I know you were constantly complaining about those areas being really bare and empty and hoping to change it in your video, but that may not be such a bad thing.<br>
That entire office complex really shouldn’t be filled to look like it has a lot of stuff going on (look where the complex is located in the middle of).</p>
<p>There is a way to have empty, bare areas and still have them visually interesting.<br>
Have a look at these images for ideas:<br>
(Not the best examples but hopefully they get the point across)</p>

+1. Very eloquently put.  I would have just said something cruel and inappropriate and then get warned again by the mods.  I’ll hold my tongue…this time.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Skully</span><br>
Re lighting: the main thing w/the lighting scheme is to compare it w/BMS B.  It’s been a while since I wrote the pitch bible so my recollection here is a little iffy.  Basically the TYPE of lighting (fluorescent vs incandescent) should match w/e’s here.</p>
<p>The concept images you provided are good and gave me an idea.  One OTHER way to dirty up the complex, which is a little too clean is to destroy a room w/a grenade.  TEXT can have a player see a section of the complex w/chunks of aliens, a chair and broken table obstructing the hallway, glass fragments etc.  Exploring the room will reveal that it has numerous cracks and is blackened.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand what I mean. I mean if you look at it from the perspective pre-disaster, the office complex looks like it was being used quite heavily. You might say some of them fled down there to escape the military, but that doesn’t change the fact that the whole office complex looks like it was being used by a lot of people, which doesn’t make much sense for a disused part of the facility.</p>
