    <description>[b][u]Mod Current Status:[/u][/b][/SIZE] Beta 2 has been released and is available for everyone to download! With the release of Beta 2, and my joining the Black Mesa Dev Team, as well as getting a new job, I no longer have the time to work on this mod, sadly. Sorry guys. I still consider On a Rail Uncut Beta 2 to be the finest piece of work I&#39;ve ever created, and despite some of its problems, I&#39;m still really damn proud of it, and more than happy to call it a &quot;finished product&quot;. I may come back to it one day, depending on how things turn out - but probably not. Thanks guys, it&#39;s been a helluva ride!

[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b][/SIZE]

Hi there everyone,

I created the Surface Tension Uncut chapters, which can be found [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=15065&#39;]here on the Black Mesa Forums[/url], and [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-surface-tension-uncut&#39;]here, on ModDB[/url]. If you haven&#39;t checked them out already, please, take them for a spin! They re-add the cut areas of Surface Tension with great detail and love.
Though it was a long and difficult project, it did not fully satisfy my mapping/creative appetite, nor did it satisfy my desire to have Black Mesa as the most complete re-creation of the Half-Life experience as possible. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve moved on to this contentious, divisive chapter from the Half-Life universe.

You can find OaR Uncut [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa-on-a-rail-uncut&#39;]here on ModDB[/url].

OaR was about the journey to the rocket (it&#39;s supposed to be a fairly &quot;epic&quot; one - hence why Gordon had to use a tram, instead of just walking!), and Black Mesa&#39;s OaR kinda missed the point of that - the actual straight line distance between the first map of Black Mesa&#39;s OaR and the actual rocket launch center was approximately 300m (and that&#39;s a VERY generous estimate, based off of a measurement done with Hammer, under the premise that 1 unit = 1 inch).

[b][u]Implementation[/u][/b][/SIZE]

I am quite deep into development of OaR Uncut at this point - the first 2 maps (of 4) are almost ready for alpha testing, and the first media release has been done. My redesign principles mirror that of Black Mesa&#39;s - I am attempting to streamline and refine the layouts of the missing maps from HL1 to avoid player confusion and make it overall a more fun experience for everyone involved.

Oar Uncut, once completed, will be released in 2 flavours: Lite and Full. The Lite package adds 2 maps to On a Rail: A1 and A2. Black Mesa&#39;s OaR had 3 maps by default: A, B and C. A1 and A2 come after A but before B. The Full package will include A1, A2, B1, and B2, restoring On a Rail to its original HL1 length, hopefully without any of the tediousness or frustration. This way, there&#39;s something for everyone. Loved BM&#39;s OaR and how short it was? That&#39;s cool, this project isn&#39;t for you. Thought BM&#39;s OaR was too short but don&#39;t want it to be as long as it was in HL1? Lite package. Want it to be as long as HL1? Full package. Everybody wins!

[b][u]Deciphering Map Jargon[/u][/b][/SIZE]

Okay, so there&#39;s a fair amount of map jargon involved in this project which people unfamiliar with Half-Life mapping may find confusing. I&#39;ve written a quick and simple guide here explaining precisely what each map is, and how they correspond to one another.

All the filenames for On a Rail maps are prefixed with C2A2. &quot;C2A2&quot; means that the map is part of the &quot;On a Rail&quot; chapter. I&#39;ve left this prefix out to make things less confusing, but bear that in mind.

Maps are named with letters corresponding to their position in the chapter. The first map of &quot;On a Rail&quot; would be called C2A2A, and the second is called C2A2B, and so on. For the purposes of simplicity, I will just refer to them as A and B. Black Mesa has 3 maps for On a Rail - A, B and C. My maps slot in around their maps. Half Life had 10 maps for On a Rail - C2A2, A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F, G, H. In the key below, I will show which Black Mesa maps will correspond with which Half-Life maps.

BM_ = Black Mesa
HL_ = Half-Life

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]Red = Default Black Mesa maps. Untouched by me. Will not be decompiled, or edited.
[COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]Orange = Black Mesa default map, which will edited by me, for a good reason.
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]Green = New, made by me.

[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]BM_A = Mostly uses content from HL_A (roughly the 1st half), plus a few new, original sections created by the BM devs.
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]BM_A1 = Assimilates the leftover content the BM Devs left out of A, with a little original content of my own. Also contains a side room from HL_B2.
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]BM_A2 = Corresponds almost identically HL_B1 and HL_C. HL_C&#39;s Office Complex has been DRAMATICALLY expanded, so overall this map is a lot bigger.
[COLOR=&#39;Orange&#39;]BM_B  = Corresponds to roughly 1st half of HL_D, with an expanded Rocket Silo (plus new puzzle).
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]BM_B1 = Will correspond roughly to the tiny missing portion of HL_D, and all of HL_E.
[COLOR=&#39;Lime&#39;]BM_B2 = Will correspond roughly to HL_F and HL_G. Parts of HL_F and HL_G will be set outdoors, to add diversity to locales and to make things more interesting.
[COLOR=&#39;Red&#39;]BM_C = Corresponds to HL_H, but with a new, original 1st half.

<p>It’s 9 months later … this error continues to occur.  Did you ever get it resolved?  This bug has been on-going for many PC gamers for nearly 2 years.</p>
<p>One of the moderators on the Steam BM Bugs discussion board, stated that the bug has nothing to do with your system.  It is a programming flaw.  He/she stated it might be fixed in version 1.5.  When asked when will that version be released, the official reply was “When it is released.”</p>
<p>Hmmmm… sound’s promising.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was looking at a MOD called Shaft and I saw they added Stuka-bats to on a rail.</p>
<p>I thought it actually made perfect sense alien bats chasing you down the tunnels whilst on a train. As you drive near them they unpin themselves from the ceiling and come after you.</p>
<p>It’s basically a major part of the game play of that chapter which is missing… An enemy that can actually make chase while you are on the train. Shoots at you hangs from the ceiling and hard to shoot possible whilst up there.</p>
<p>I looked over your level and I think what you have done is very good. If I would critique the design there would be 3 things I would change.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would keep the Rocket at the end of the chapter entirely and Remove the  outside train Yard entirely. The Rocky Tunnel was quite nice though and the Puzzle after the massive Yard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would Remove the whole Cafeteria Store Room Fight and Replace with A section Similar to how Route Canal Works. Jumping onto a moving train with Carridges to Get to another Area which is otherwise inaccessible. Then have to fight across the Tracks the other side. Distance Fight with enemy in Cover. Like they are now Chasing you down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would Remove the whole Lights Off Fight and keep very simple and use this point to join to the Last Default On a rail map with the Rocket. The Bit I like is where you can Shoot the Other cart with soldiers and then Jump off yours and then on to the Other Cart. That is Cool Gameplay… Perhaps a disaster needs to loom at the end of the track the player is on here such as a deadly drop where the track is broken meaning you have to pull off the Jump to the other Cart as a means to progress and avoid death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Parts Where you are on the train Are Good you did and the Lift Sections and so on what I am saying is keep the rocket at the end but extend the Journey add Stukabats as perfect enemy for on a rail. Use of more Barnacles also. rather than having to keep stop start stop start.</p>
<p>More Tunnels you Have to Smash Through i.e. Boarded up.  Shooting the Odd Switch to change the Tracks.</p>
<p>A Hecu operated Tram following Behind you also would be beneficial to adding to the Chase.</p>
<p>I defo mean Stukabats and not the Flocking Floaters… Flocking Floaters look bad.</p>
<p>Perhaps a 180 degree turn Crouch Button is needed for the Train Vehicle to make game play swift when in control of speed… At a single push of a button you can crouch and look behind you say shift. would work for that.</p>
<p>I would go with HECU Sentry Drones over Flocking Floaters… I see somone added Flying Turrets to a MOD and this would also serve a similar Purpose. Drone Turret basically. Manhack sort of thing. They just Float and shoot but can pivot the Gun they activate on the Red Laser Triggers.</p>

<p>If I were to go back and redo On a Rail Uncut again (which I will DEFINITELY NEVER DO, just to be clear), that would be one section that I would completely reimagine from scratch, instead of just improving on what I’d thought up already. It could be outrageously better than how it turned out. Just thought you’d find that interesting. Not disparaging the fact that you like that scene, though! Different strokes for different folks.</p>

            <p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/36331-TextFAMGUY1/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@TextFAMGUY1</a> You’ve mentioned before that you’re not really happy with how parts of On A Rail Uncut turned out. Could you mind elaborating? I know you have no intention to revisit the mod, but as a hypothetical, if you could start over again, knowing what you know now, what would you change?</p>

<p>Bug that has existed since it came out on workshop: in the roundabout area you go to after launching the rocket, there are no enemies, but in the base game there are.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, and the cause of this “bug” is because in the Free version of Black Mesa (the version that this mod was made), there wasn’t any enemies (you can check this by watching a gameplay in youtube).</p>
<p>So i hope he add those enemies back just like in the Retail version.</p>

            <p>I’m working on this again, in a limited capacity. That limited capacity is basically bugfixes and resolving major issues with the workshop version for retail. No more, no less.</p>
<p>So, please, any outstanding serious issues with the <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">workshop version for retail ONLY</span></span>, please post them here. I will work to resolve them and update when I can.</p>
<p>Note: with the big update for OaRU I will also likely ship the mapsrc files with the mod, so the community can do what they like with the maps. All in the modding spirit!</p>

<p>It’s to do with a bug in the Vort’s AI routines. This has been present in the mod release but seems amplified in retail at the moment. If the Vort can’t path to you, he’ll freeze. We’re overhauling AGrunt and Vort AI for CU3, so hopefully I won’t even need to make any adjustments for it to be fixed in the future.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks for the clarifications!</p>
<p>There is also those two headcrabs falling down a vent at the beginning of the second map which seem to be bugged. They stay inside the vent, like stuck, even though the vent’s grating falls down. Hopefully the next update to Black Mesa will fix that too. Other than that, OaR Uncut runs like a charm.</p>
