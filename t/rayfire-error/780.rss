    <title>Rayfire error</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/rayfire-error/780</link>
    <description>OK, I&#39;ve resolved the map compiling problem for ep1 (for those who know), but now I have a problem with rayfire for 3ds max 2010. Whenever I put many fragments ( iterations,) or fragment multiple objects and explode them, then some of the fragments freeze, or the animation is only baked for the first two frames. I use rayfire 1.44, mabe someone could help me? ( my modelling computer is going through an OS reinstall, so no pics.) I also own Maya, mabe blastcode is something I should think about.
