    <title>Need more download links (in split rar files)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/need-more-download-links-in-split-rar-files/10578</link>
    <description>Other than the download links that download the whole thing, is there someone here in the gaming community that was able to release Black Mesa at least several 500 MB split files in RAR format (from a 3.1 GB 7zip file) into GameFront? The last time a big mod was released (i.e. Renegade-X Black Dawn at 3.9 GB), someone managed to release several split files and they satisfy most users with slow-internet connections. I have a 768kpbs DSL connection and I cannot download a 3.1GB file in one session. If I download over 2 GB download in one session, my ISP will disconnect and lose data. I do not really want to afford using Internet Download Manager or Download Accelerator Plus to do this, because most game sites do not allow pause and resume downloads especially on big files, and currently as of now the servers are still crowded. Also I do not use Torrent and never will.

If anyone would post those download links, I would be appreciated and especially to those people who have yet to download this mod.

As for Steam, that will take months before this mod is officially released there.</description>

            <p>I don’t understand why would you not use torrent? It’s the most convenient way to download big files.</p>
