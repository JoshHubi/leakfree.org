The only differences I’ve noticed are changes to health stations, which heal over time, and the addition of a sprint button, making those speed-runs even speedier. While the levels have changed slightly, everything from the feel of the weapons (sadly, no Gravity Gun) to the little scripted moments will be instantly recognisable to those who have played Half-life to (half) death.

Unfortunately, BM remains incomplete at this stage. The mod team argues that the final few hours of the Half-life campaign have been left out so that fans may enjoy a satisfying experience now. BM has been in development for a long time, so it would have been a tough decision to release a denim vest now (metaphorically speaking), and then add in the sleeves later for that complete stone-washed look. While development has already begun on the last few levels, newcomers may feel like BM ends on a pseudo-cliff-hanger.

Good:

 - Much easier on the eyes and ears
 - Greater sense of scope
 - Remains faithful to the original…
 - …which means Black Mesa is still an incredible shooter
 - More Black Mesa is due “soon”, including a deathmatch mode
 - Crowbar’s swinging animation actually inspired by Minecraft (but not really)

Bad:

 - Incomplete singleplayer campaign
 - A lot of crouch-jumping
 - No Gravity Gun
 - Strangely long load times

            <p>What? “Strangely long load times” WTF? Did they look at some of these textures? Do they think those just live in the RAM?<br>
Also, “no gravity gun” is a bit of a joke.<br>
On the other hand, they seem to treat it like an actual game which I think is good because that is exactly what it feels like and it shows some respect to the effort. Hope we’ll see lot’s of reviews in the next couple of days.</p>
