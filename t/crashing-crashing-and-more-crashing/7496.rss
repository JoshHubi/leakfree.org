    <title>crashing, crashing, and more crashing</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crashing-crashing-and-more-crashing/7496</link>
    <description>I installed updates for my OS (Windows 7) and now whenever I use firefox it crashes within minutes of my using it. Not only that, but if I manage to get to sites like youtube without crashing I&#39;m not able to view videos mostly because adobe will crash or if it does not I am simply not able to play the video.  Basically, what should have been beneficial for my system is now fucking me over. What to do?</description>
