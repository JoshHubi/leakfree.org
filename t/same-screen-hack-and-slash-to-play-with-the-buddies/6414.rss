    <title>Same screen hack and slash to play with the buddies??</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/same-screen-hack-and-slash-to-play-with-the-buddies/6414</link>
    <description>I am hoping someone on here knows something I, or google, does not know.  I am looking for a same screen at least 3 player hack and slash game preferably with some RPG elements that i can play with my room mates.  We have an xbox 360 and an xbox so either of those consoles are prefered.  We have already dominated Castle crashers, we play the SHIT out of geo wars 2, we are just looking for something we can all 3 play ( like castle crashers ) and have some fun with it.  Any suggestions are much appreciated!

            <p>If you want to get a PS2, 4 controllers, and an adapter so you can hook up the two extra controllers, the Champions of Norrath games are pretty good.  They’re made by the team that made the first Dark Alliance, so they use the same engine, and the only real differences are up to 4 players, and they removed the ability to jump, and replaced it with a second hotkeyed skill.</p>
<p>Plus, like Diablo, there are semi random map layouts.</p>

<p>oh hell yeah i heard diablo was crazy.  Just looked up DD heroes and it fits the requirements so were gonna give it a try</p>

</aside>
<p>If you play hack n’ slashes and haven’t played Diablo 1 or Diablo 2, you need to get them, NOW, spend the next 6 months playing and replaying them, and then report back.  GO!</p>
<p>Side note - Diablo II (specifically its expansion, Lord of Destruction) is probably my favorite PC game of all time (and I’ve played many).  The game came out in what, 1998?  And I’m still playing it (or rather, a fantastic mod for it called <a href="https://blue.arimyth.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Hell Unleashed</a>).</p>
<p>So yeah, get yourself some D2, Hamachi, and Vent (maybe Hamachi and Vent aren’t necessary if you’re roommates) and spend some quality time.</p>

            <p>I also suggest that you and your friends immediately buy Diablo II and it’s expansions and play online on your computers, one of my favorite games of all time, and D3 will be out in some time!</p>
<p>OH! I always loved this game and its 4p IIRC, Dungeons and Dragons Heroes on the Xbox, it’s better than the 2 Baldur’s Gate games, and pretty long. Really fun and Hack n’ Slash.</p>
