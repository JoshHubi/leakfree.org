    <title>What Are You Playing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-are-you-playing/725</link>
    <description>Because variety is the spice of overused clichés, I&#39;m sure you lot have played all sorts of games whilst we&#39;re waiting for The Exalted Overlords&#39; magnum opus - and not just Source powered games. Post what you&#39;re playing at the moment, and then we can make some light hearted jabs at each other for poor taste

I&#39;ve been playing -

[b]Tropico[/b] - I had a massive attack of nostalgia a few weeks ago, so I decided to purchase a copy of the original Tropico - it made me realise that its gameplay mechanics were little different from other similar management games from the same time frame, but it&#39;s managed to hold its own by being quite an amusing satire of Cold War politics. So that was nice

[b]The Sims 3[/b] - My main family in the Riverview town is ridiculously large, so much so that my laptop is ah, beginning to chug a bit. I&#39;m still finding it massive fun, there&#39;s a greater incentive for the family to do stuff in town, whereas the other two games had a discouragingly long load time between locations. The moodlet mechanic is also a good idea, my favourite being the &#39;Duck Time&#39; moodlet, for having a rubber duck in the bathtub
[b]
Team Fortress 2[/b] - I have donator privileges and the server I frequent, and by god, I&#39;m going to use them. I usually main as Demoman or spy since the former is the most flexible, and the latter is simply a lot of fun to play, although the recent update means that there&#39;s a lot of spies who simply run around with the Ambassador instead of actually doing something useful. Wankers

[b]Open TTD[/b] - I did a &#39;Let&#39;s Play&#39; article for the forum I frequent (the bottom one, not the top) as I enjoyed the original, and was delighted that an open-source version was available. The open-source version actually improves on the original too instead of simply being an open source clone, although the isometric 8bpp graphics are a bit sore on the eyes. Good portable game too, I just load it from my USB drive and play it on my netbook whenever I&#39;m on the train

[b]Mass Effect[/b] - My First RPG (yay! *sucks thumb* etc). I have to admit it was something of a revelation for me - the first RPG I tried to play was Diablo, and I found it so obtuse that I wouldn&#39;t touch an RPG for another 12 years. The reason why I decided to try Mass Effect was because my last genre shift (transitioning between RTSs to FPSs in 2001) was largely a success. Admittedly Mass Effect isn&#39;t really an RPG in the classical sense - it&#39;s more RPG by way of Deus Ex rather then by Icewind Dale, and I still find the traditional RPGs utterly infuriating. Still, I&#39;m playing ME again because I&#39;m getting quite excited about ME2, so I&#39;m going through the story again to get something perfect for ME2s [url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus]Save Game Plus[/url]
[b]
Quake 4[/b] - It&#39;s shit

            <p>I’m mainly playing Assassins Creed right now. I only just recently actually played this for the first time, and tbh its nothing like I expected. My idea of it was just a badly done version of Splinter Cell, but actually I think this is more like Prince of Persia, but done properly. it’s awesome, specially the freeclimbing.</p>
<p>In short I love Assassin’s Creed.</p>

            <p>I’ve been primarily scooting about Liberty City these days when I can find a minute between my three jobs (shush, children, I like money), but I’ve also been playing around with Baldur’s Gate II again. It needs a bit of work to actually run correctly on Vista, but once I get the settings worked out right it’s just as fantastic as my nostalgia goggles remember it.</p>

            <p>Because variety is the spice of overused clichés, I’m sure you lot have played all sorts of games whilst we’re waiting for The Exalted Overlords’ magnum opus - and not just Source powered games. Post what you’re playing at the moment, and then we can make some light hearted jabs at each other for poor taste</p>
<p>I’ve been playing -</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tropico</span> - I had a massive attack of nostalgia a few weeks ago, so I decided to purchase a copy of the original Tropico - it made me realise that its gameplay mechanics were little different from other similar management games from the same time frame, but it’s managed to hold its own by being quite an amusing satire of Cold War politics. So that was nice</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Sims 3</span> - My main family in the Riverview town is ridiculously large, so much so that my laptop is ah, beginning to chug a bit. I’m still finding it massive fun, there’s a greater incentive for the family to do stuff in town, whereas the other two games had a discouragingly long load time between locations. The moodlet mechanic is also a good idea, my favourite being the ‘Duck Time’ moodlet, for having a rubber duck in the bathtub<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Team Fortress 2</span> - I have donator privileges and the server I frequent, and by god, I’m going to use them. I usually main as Demoman or spy since the former is the most flexible, and the latter is simply a lot of fun to play, although the recent update means that there’s a lot of spies who simply run around with the Ambassador instead of actually doing something useful. Wankers</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Open TTD</span> - I did a ‘Let’s Play’ article for the forum I frequent (the bottom one, not the top) as I enjoyed the original, and was delighted that an open-source version was available. The open-source version actually improves on the original too instead of simply being an open source clone, although the isometric 8bpp graphics are a bit sore on the eyes. Good portable game too, I just load it from my USB drive and play it on my netbook whenever I’m on the train</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mass Effect</span> - My First RPG (yay! <em>sucks thumb</em> etc). I have to admit it was something of a revelation for me - the first RPG I tried to play was Diablo, and I found it so obtuse that I wouldn’t touch an RPG for another 12 years. The reason why I decided to try Mass Effect was because my last genre shift (transitioning between RTSs to FPSs in 2001) was largely a success. Admittedly Mass Effect isn’t really an RPG in the classical sense - it’s more RPG by way of Deus Ex rather then by Icewind Dale, and I still find the traditional RPGs utterly infuriating. Still, I’m playing ME again because I’m getting quite excited about ME2, so I’m going through the story again to get something perfect for ME2s <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Save Game Plus</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Quake 4</span> - It’s shit</p>
<p>Carry on</p>
