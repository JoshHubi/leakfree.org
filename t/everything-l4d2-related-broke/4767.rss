    <title>Everything L4D2 related broke.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/everything-l4d2-related-broke/4767</link>
    <description>I was testing my custom Left 4 Dead 2 map and I closed Left 4 Dead 2 normally
but when I tried to start it back up it said &quot;completing installation&quot; and when it finished the window closed and Left 4 Dead never started up. I rebooted my computer and Left 4 dead still wont&#39; start up and neither will Left 4 Dead 2 authoring tools. 

Is there anyway to fix this other than reinstalling Left 4 Dead 2?</description>
