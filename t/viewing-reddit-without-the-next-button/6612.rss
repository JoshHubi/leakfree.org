    <title>Viewing reddit without the &quot;next&quot; button?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/viewing-reddit-without-the-next-button/6612</link>
    <description>Being one of those addictive personalities, I tend to stay on forums/news sites for far too long. The problem with this, is that the information never ends. 

So I had an idea, where I limit the things I read on reddit by either blocking or disabling the &quot;next&quot; button. 

Problem is, I&#39;m a total noob at designing anything. So the question is,
Is javascript the thing to use to do something like this?(editing how you view websites?) 
If not, what can I do to make this happen?

I know at least a few people will respond with, &quot;lol, learn self control then&quot; or &quot;just use adblock and avoid the thing altogether&quot;, but I want to try to do this partly to see if it can be done, and to learn javascript, if I can do it in there.

nevermind, did some digging, found this:

javascript:$(&#39;p[class=&#39;nextprev&#39;]&#39;).hide()

works for me just fine.</description>
