            <p>I’ve got a rather fun bug where the RPG doesn’t spawn so I’m unable to trigger the helicopter boss. Thus unable to continue, anyone else had this bug? (Or any work around available? )</p>
<p>/edit. Using noclip I discovered it had spawned under the floor underneath the table. Leaving this here in case anyone else gets this bug!</p>

            <p>It’s a known bug (thought it was fixed already). You can’t approach that door from the outside before entering the building.<br>
You have to go straight for the jump pads.</p>

            <p>SmartAss won’t come with me after opening the door, in Surface Tension, where Gordon and the security guard stealth walk past the guards. He just stays there. Doesn’t respond to “E”. I walk away from him. still not moving. No aliens appear on the streets, because he just stays there, and doesn’t “trigger” the next event. I killed him once, on purpose. You would’ve killed him too. Trust me. Any ideas?   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I think I have found a bug, unfortunately. I’m on top of the tower, trying to shoot the gargantua but the shots from the air strikes aren’t killing him, neither are they exploding when they hit anywhere else. So basically, I can not continue.</p>

<p>I find the Tau Cannon is a bit iffy to use sometimes, it behaves in a strange way, I can’t even tell if it’s hitscan or not. Just keep trying, it’ll work once you figure it out.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the Marines, they take cover behind a barricade and never advance. If you stay by the warehouse and parking lot, they rarely give you any trouble unless you stand in the middle of the street (which is bad anyway). Take cover behind one of the vehicles and charge a shot while you wait for it to fly overhead, then shoot it. You can either do this twice, or hit it with a charged shot, then follow up with a barrage of uncharged shots. When it takes too much damage, it’ll burst into flames and retreat.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I was unclear there. I’m charging the shots. They bounce as if I’m firing at terrain. I’ve tried hitting the main rotor, tail rotor, engine, cockpit, sides, underside, tail boom. No effect. I’ve emptied every gun I have at it. No effect. It’s like firing at a piece of terrain or stationary prop with the difference being this one kills me from full health and fully charged suit in somewhere between one to two seconds.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I was unclear there. I’m charging the shots. They bounce as if I’m firing at terrain. I’ve tried hitting the main rotor, tail rotor, engine, cockpit, sides, underside, tail boom. No effect. I’ve emptied every gun I have at it. No effect. It’s like firing at a piece of terrain or stationary prop with the difference being this one kills me from full health and fully charged suit in somewhere between one to two seconds.</p>

            <p>Well the tactical map WILL NOT FIRE. I’ve tried reloading, restarting the map and I’m using the correct button to fire. It moves the targetting, I click and it goes red, but nothing happens. Is there any fix available? Because this is annoying me to an unbelievable degree.</p>

            <p>You need to crouch-jump over the lasers very carefully.  IIRC, this is the beginning of the room with the mess of laser-tripmines near the bomb.  Breaking the laser causes the tripmine to blow up and sets off the bomb.</p>
<p>Try to not break the laser.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>It’s cuz this area is poorly scripted.  I believe the intention here was to have the 2 vorts and Agrunts attack the marines to serve as a distraction while you run up and snipe the Osprey.  However, they always attack you so after you kill them, you are locked in the tunnel because of the marines and their rediculous accuracy.</p>
<p>A good solution would be to readjust the alien script so that they attack the HECU from the outset.  Then have the Osprey drop 8-10 marines…if the player doesnt figure out to kill it, it simply flies away.  It’s much more forgiving not to mention realistic.</p>

            <p>Yes, that was my reaction too.  So far though, I am immensely impressed by the game.  I would say it’s more fun to play than the original, as well as being so much better to look at.</p>
