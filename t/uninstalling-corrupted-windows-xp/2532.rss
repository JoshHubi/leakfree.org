    <title>Uninstalling corrupted Windows XP</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/uninstalling-corrupted-windows-xp/2532</link>
    <description>Alright I need some help, I have two HDD&#39;s each with Windows XP 64-bit installed. Recently there was a power blackout in our house and one of the Windows now has a corrupted registry, every time I try to boot into it I get a blue-screen that quickly vanishes and then the PC restarts.
I can still access the other Windows, from this version I can also access the files on the &#39;corrupted&#39; Windows install.

My question is, how do I uninstall the corrupted Windows version? I tried booting through my install disk but I get the same blue-screen, so basically I need to know how to remove everything from my hard disk so that I can reinstall a clean Windows.</description>

            <p>Finally got Vista to install on the proper HDD, it was a fucking nightmare but it works. Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Also I would never use a magnet to erase my HDD files but thanks for the tip anyway… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>Alright pretty simple solution…<br>
Download <a href="https://gparted.sourceforge.net/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Gparted</a>, and burn it to a disk and format the drive that way.<br>
Then just reinstall XP, or better quit being cheap and install windows 7.</p>

            <p>If you said your other partition of windows boots fine, just boot into there and do what Angdraug said. Go to “My computer” right click on the drive thats all fucked up, and hit format. Use the NTFS file system and you’re good to go.</p>

            <p>Yeah, wiping a magnet over a disk will erase it, but using a software method is a way better idea in my opinion. I don’t know the risks of it, but I have a feeling it can do much more damage to your drive then just erasing it. You can actually pull the registry out of a restore point, and use that. I did it once to fix a computer, and it worked fine, but it took a while, and formatting would have been much easier.</p>
<p>Also, you can’t uninstall an operating system. If you want to remove it, you pretty much have to wipe the entire drive.</p>
<p>If you want to wipe the entire drive, download Ubuntu burn it to a CD and boot from that, and you can format the drive that way.</p>

<p>Because CHKDSK is easier and lets you keep your files. If CHKDSK doesn’t work, he can use your suggestion. And if that doesn’t work too i would consider to check the harddisk for corrupt blocks on a different pc and buy a new harddisk eventually.</p>
<p>The official Black Mesa Forum solution for your Problem is:</p>

<p>Use a powerful magnet. I don’t know if it actually works, but its worth a try. Just swipe the hard disk with the magnet a few times.</p>

<p>It will work in this Universe.</p>

<p>Huh? He just said he can’t get into windows or the CD…<br>
Yeah, I would try another computer. The magnet thing, I’ve never heard of, but since I have heard that magnets mess up hard drives it might work. Another thing you might try is getting a different boot CD i.e. a linux installation and see if that works to format your HDD.</p>

            <p>Although I don’t understand why anyone would want to keep 2 separate installations of same OS, it seems it saved you this time. And you say you don’t need any files from that other HDD?</p>
<p>So boot up the working windows, go to My Computer, right click on the other HDD. Then select format. Voilà, you’re all set.</p>

            <p>I already tried booting through the disk, but I get no option to delete Windows or anything it simply tries to start and goes blue-screen on me, that’s why I was wondering if it’s possible to just nuke all the files on the disk.</p>

            <p>So… you can’t boot from a windows disk? If possible just hookup the HD to another computer and delete the partition that way. That’s the best thing I can think of unless someone has an simpler solution…</p>
<p>If you do decide to do that, it’s rather simple after you find the extra computer. (i tend to have enough extra parts from old computers so I’m able to troubleshoot my own PC easier). Just boot up on the OS disk, and choose the option that says something like “delete partition by using the NTFS(FAT) file system”</p>
<p>Although I’ve never  seen a corrupted OS BSODing when booting via disk… I’ve BSOD while install OS’s though… Anyway it’s like 2am so I could be totally wrong.</p>
<p>I’d wait until one of the other nerds check out this topic before doing anything rash.</p>
