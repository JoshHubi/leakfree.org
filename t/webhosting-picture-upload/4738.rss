    <title>Webhosting / picture upload</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/webhosting-picture-upload/4738</link>
    <description>A friend of my father&#39;s has offered to pay me if I can get a website running for him where people can register an account, upload a hi-res picture, and have an e-mail sent to him informing him of the upload so he can print it. 
His business is printing photographs. he wants to run the website, or at least the file hosting part of it, off a windows 2003 server that he already has up and running, and as far as I know, it would be the only thing running on it. 
I have come to you to ask for help and guidance, and particularly seek the opinion of Hubi, who I know is experienced in this matter, but if anyone else has any suggestions as regards software and that kind of stuff, or even better, specific experience in the matter, please, go ahead. 
Thanks in advance, wheybags.</description>

            <p>Depending on which programming environment you feel safer in (C#/PHP) you could look at this.<br>

However, I admit PHP could end up simpler.</p>

Feel free to PM me if you need halp.</p>

            <p>So are you able to program it, you just cant figure out how to do the uploading? Or do you have no idea where to start?</p>
<p>Also, I’m not impressed with my discovery in your signature.</p>

            <p>I think he’s OK with that, what he needs is the actual uploading part.</p>

            <p>In order to host anything on the windows box you need to get some sort of web interface running; <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">WAMP</a> will provide the necessary services for webhosting (Apache, MySQL, PHP).</p>
<p>I couldn’t well advise you on setting up the actual website; you’d need to write some sort of web application to store uploads in the database and notify your client when a picture gets ‘posted’…you’d be doing this with PHP/MySQL but I couldn’t tell you where to start.</p>
