    <title>Source SDK 2007 Crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/source-sdk-2007-crash/10898</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am really happy that you guys manged to develop this black mesa project ! I downloaded it right away and... well, cant play till today  :slight_smile: 

The problem is - as i guess - within my Source SDK base 2007.
It is what gets crashed while i try to run Black Mesa.
I re-downloaded the tool, verified integrity (of all three Source SDK products avaible on steam), disabled the antivirus software, and still nothing. Other HL2 based games run fine (i checked HL2: the lost coast), as well as the Source SDK base 2006 does.

I&#39;d love to play balck mesa, but I&#39;m stuck with this problem. Any help would appreciated. My hw config:


i5 2500k@4.8 --- Goodram 1333 8 GB --- GB gtx560ti OC
SSD 128 GB --- 2xSamsung t166@raid1 +2xSamsung hdd403 HJ@raid0
Antec 550 W --- Asrock p67 extreme6 --- XFi music
Antec Solo --- Fander2x,Zalman CNPS11X, Noctua
MS Natural 4000, --- CAL! --- Logitech G400

<p>According to this statement, anyone who is posting ‘unofficial’ help tips or possible solutions for a problem (which have not been previously ‘validated’), are not allowed to do so?</p>
<p>Because a moderator or official member of the team has not confirmed that a solution works, it does not mean that said tips are unqualified.</p>
<p>Other than that, if they fixed the issue, why would you bother posting a thread for your problem?</p>
<p>Every computer and every environment is different, which makes the assumption that it “crashes all computers” invalid.</p>
<p>On one machine the suggested solution works like a charm, on another however, it does not.</p>
<p>Sometimes the exact same configuration can create different results, when it comes to solving problems.</p>

<p>My only guess would be that somehow Black Mesa’s installation has been corrupted (by whatever means).</p>
<p>I can’t think of a valid cause, but try deleting the “<span class="bbcode-b">…\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS</span>” folder, then re-installing it (into the sourcemods folder).</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A similiar problem appeared to happen to my installation yesterday:</span></p>
<p>I had found ‘older’ savegames of mine, where I had progressed further through the game, but they got corrupted (previously), forcing me to re-install the game.</p>
<p>That may sound weird, but what’s even weirder is the fact that I put the (corrupt) <span class="bbcode-b">SAVE</span> folder back into the BMS directory (once I re-installed it), then started the game and <span class="bbcode-i">Poof!</span> - “<span class="bbcode-b">hl2.exe has stopped working!</span>”.</p>
<p>This would mean that starting the game with corrupt savegames somehow corrupts the rest of the game (or certain parts), as well.</p>
<p>I’ve tried defragmenting and verifying the integrity of all SDK tools, too - but, still - it didn’t help.</p>
<p>Deleting said <span class="bbcode-b">SAVE</span> folder didn’t help the problem, either - only re-installing did.</p>

<p>No story telling intended, it’s just something I wanted to mention - maybe it helps…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
