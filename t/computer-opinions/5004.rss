    <description>Hey all,

First post, so please be nice!


I am considering purchasing the below system before the new year; with the expected VAT and component cost increases looming I think that I should invest in a new rig fairly soon. I am by no means a computer G, so I would greatly appreciate any input/advice.


This is the system;

[url]https://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=FS-101-OE[/url]



I am just looking for opinions or concerns which you would raise if you were purchasing the system yourself. I am looking for rig which will leave me open to longevity and upgrades further down the line. For example, worth getting a system with USB 3 features etc.

I&#39;m at work atm so I&#39;ve not really written my first post very well and I&#39;m sure that I more questions will come to me over time!


Thanks for your time  :slight_smile:

<p>I just bought the Fermi GTX 480, don’t worry about the heat, besides, its designed to run at those temp’s otherwise it wouldn’t be on the market, as for 'better on Crysis its been shown that Ati is now taking the lead, saying this, 480 takes the 5870 out of the competition, but the 5970 has an advantage in power, but Nvidia seem to be the superior for utilizing other area’s including tessellation of a such, but comparing the GTX 480 to the 5970 is pretty unfair, look at how much THEY cost.</p>
<p>But to be fair, all the prices are different, at the moment, id reccomend the GTX 480 (I own the Asus edition)</p>

            <p>Well it depends. I definitely wouldn’t get any of the GTX 4xx series unless you’re SLIng them (2 460s in SLI are a really great value). The new GeForces are powerhungry and run extremely hot. In general Radeons give you better bang for the buck, but you’ll be fine either way.</p>

            <p>You can’t really quantify the extra performance for a price increase, especially when you get closer to the top, where slight increases in performance can nearly double a price tag.  I’d also avoid the BLU-RAAAAAAAAYYYY  drive for now, since they’re still mad expensive and not really the norm, yet.</p>
<p>Everybody around here shouts for ATI, but I haven’t had any trouble with my NVidia cards, and honestly the performance difference is probably negligible to anybody who isn’t a gigantic graphics whore, and those people are shallow anyway.</p>

<p>I know what you mean; I was considering going down a slightly cheap AMD route. I’ve been using a system from early 2005 which wasn’t designed for gaming. It currently has an Atl 4760 and 1GB of DDR (which is comprised of two different 512 sticks). I feel like Dr Mengele, sticking the odd upgrade in there to keep it ticking over.</p>
<p>I’ve been quite restricted in the games I’ve been able to buy and play properly due to my system limitations. The company I linked above has an option to pay within 12 months with no interest added at all; this makes the cost factor slightly less of an issue; not having to pay it all at once is good for me tbh.</p>
<p>I’ve had my eye on it for about a month now; just wondering what other people think of the spec and what could/should be altered. I’d like to stick a Blu-Ray drive in there too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my biggest decision would be the ATI / NVIDIA option; can’t make head nor tale of the comparisson charts all over the internet. While the latest Fermi cards seem to come out top, I’m finding it hard to quantify/justify the extra cost in the board itself and the extra power usage and heat expenditure.</p>

<p>Vat is ‘value added tax’; I’ve been reading that, in the UK at least, there will be a bit of hike in Vat in the coming year. I’ve also been reading that component prices in general are set to rise, such as RAM currently being more expensive than it was say, at the start of this year. I’m not an economist so I don’t know how much merit there is in what I’ve been reading; I just think that I’d rather shell out now as opposed to paying more for the same/similar product in the new year.</p>
<p>Alot of people have suggested that I shouldn’t purchase a pre-made machine, mainly for the cost reasons. If I’m honest, I’d love to make one myself but as I’ve never done it before I don’t have too much confidence. From looking around on the internet at similar spec systems, the price seems okay considering they put the system together, ready overclocked. I have friends who swear by their pre and post customer service support as well.</p>
<p>In regards to the actual machine, do you think it’s a viable option for someone who wishes to have a fairly decent gaming rig for the next 2-3 years? I’m aware of the rate which technology progresses; which has put me off buying a new system for quite a while now. The way I see it is that I could keep thinking this and putting it off for longer and longer and being in this position another year down the line.</p>

            <p>You won’t get a system that will comfortably last you a long time/be easily upgradable.  Every time I’ve designed a computer for such, it turned out to not work out that way.  However, you still shouldn’t buy a pre-made computer.</p>
<p>What’s VAT?  What component cost increases?</p>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>First post, so please be nice!</p>
<p>I am considering purchasing the below system before the new year; with the expected VAT and component cost increases looming I think that I should invest in a new rig fairly soon. I am by no means a computer G, so I would greatly appreciate any input/advice.</p>
<p>This is the system;</p>

<p>I am just looking for opinions or concerns which you would raise if you were purchasing the system yourself. I am looking for rig which will leave me open to longevity and upgrades further down the line. For example, worth getting a system with USB 3 features etc.</p>
<p>I’m at work atm so I’ve not really written my first post very well and I’m sure that I more questions will come to me over time!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
