    <description>Hi, guys! I have a problem on Windows 7 x64.
Each time on start Black Mesa i see blinking screen after &quot;loading screen&quot;. 5-6 blinkings and  message box with &quot;hl2.exe was crashed&quot;. I tried to set compatibility mode with Windows XP, restarts Steam and etc.
Game was launched good 2 times. Another 99% starts was crashed  :frowning:

            <p>Hi, I don’t know if this will help with your specific crash problem, and I know this is kinda late, but I’m just going to post my fix anyways.  The problem with mine was a corrupted config file.  For some reason, once in a blue moon or because of something you did to the configuration of your system/game the configuration file becomes corrupt.  The game doesn’t know how to handle that, and just quits.</p>
<p>The fix: delete the configuration file.  Once you do that, the game will recreate it, and you just need to re-input your preferred settings.</p>

            <p>Same with me… Strangely, it worked perfectly fine the first day I installed it… next day… always the same crash, different time. Sometimes the main menu comes, sometimes it already crashes, when its still blurred.</p>
<p>Didn’t change anything from the first day!</p>

            <p>try this out, go to Black Mesa in the library, right click it, click on properties then click on ‘Set Launch Options’ in the text field put in this EXACTLY:</p>
<p>-dxlevel 9.0</p>
<p>It might work now…</p>
