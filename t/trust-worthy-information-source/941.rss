<p>Jesus was a person, and if he existed, he was a great guy. Jesus != god, and so you can believe in one and not the other.</p>
<p>He basically believed that everyone should be good, and happy, and nice (simplified). So that’s what they try to do.</p>

<p>They’re only embarrassing themselves. Next time someone says that, tell them they’re wrong because google is wrong. It’s ignorant but a hell of a lot more justified than attacking wikipedia. Wikipedia is essentially a search engine built from scratch by humanity as opposed to generated arbitrarily by bots. Plenty of references are cited for every major article. Of course it’s not perfect, but it’s as good as anything else because in the end you always have to rely on humans, which are untrustworthy.</p>

            <p>Well hopefully the wiki pages that you visit have been properly cited so you can go to the bottom of the page and see where the information actually comes from.  My experience is that wikipedia is a great general source of information, but you wouldn’t want to use it for anything official i.e. school or work related.</p>

<p>I dont want to get anything. I just want to educate myself so the next time when im in a chatroom or reading a thread, ill know what people are talking about by learning the accurate and up to date facts.</p>
<p>There’s nothing more embarrassing than being put in ur place when giving a reply and some asshole (trying to make himself look smart) replies with: <span class="bbcode-i">“hahha. u probably got that off Wiki. Wiki is incorrect, its actually blah blah blah”</span></p>

            <p>Interesting enough, I’ve been told by teachers and professors the Christian Science Monitor is one of the most unbiased news outlets around.  I’ve never checked, though, so I’m not sure whether to believe it.</p>

            <p>It depends on what you’re searching : wikipedia is good most of the time if articles are cross-checked and with plenty of reference. News on the other hand are biased by the media who brought it (works for all media : TV, radio, press, internet, etc. because they give you their point of view or the goverment’s one). Only raw material from news agencies (AP/Reuters/AFP) are more accurate because they don’t give a developpement so it’s up to you to make your mind. Other option is to check an info from multiples sources from different countries : it’s fun to see how an event is seen from the outside and maybe sometimes totaly transformed (especialy with events like riots or wars).</p>
<p>Today, if you control medias, you will control minds…</p>

            <p>Not true.</p>
<p>He might very well have asked us knowing that we would never give unbiased information because it is quite impossible to be unbiased. However, from all our views it is possible to create a general overview that might be less biased than all our views. So it’s a good question, if you ask me  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>As for the question itself: read and crossreference the references wikipedia gives you at the end of an article. If an article doesn’t have references: it’s not trustworthy. Also: google and your local university/college/library will have trustworthy info, it’s just quite tedious to look for it.</p>
