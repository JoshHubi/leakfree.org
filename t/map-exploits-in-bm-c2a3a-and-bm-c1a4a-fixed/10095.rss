    <title>Map exploits in bm_c2a3a and bm_c1a4a [Fixed]</title>

    <description>Hello everyone.

In the maps listed in the thread title i have found some exploits.

Map bm_c1a4a : At the end of the railway where the pool of acid is, there is a rock you can sort of surf/climb up and get from there to the other side of the pit.

Screenshot(s) of it:

Map bm_c2a3a : Here where you first encounter the Ichthyosaur there is a map exploit, and what may be considered an unintended outcome. 
1. On tho other side of the catwalk from the entrance door, you can jump onto the railing, and there is a barnacle, hanging right next to the end of the broken exit catwalk, which you can jump to, kill and from there completely bypass that part of the level, and not even get the crossbow.

Approximate getpos of the barnacle/glitch area:
setpos 3006.054199 718.765747 -543.968750;setang 5.050199 -161.004059 0.000000


2. Due to the clearer water then original GoldSrc engine, you can slightly see where the Ichthyosaur from above water, kill him &quot;i used a shotgun&quot;. And once again completely bypass the crossbow/cage section. Although not a glitch, i think it seems a little pointless for the crossbow section to be there, if you can easily kill the Ichthyosaur with conventional weapons up to that point.
