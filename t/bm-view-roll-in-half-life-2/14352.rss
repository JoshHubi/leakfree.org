    <title>BM View Roll in Half Life 2?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bm-view-roll-in-half-life-2/14352</link>
    <description>Hello,

While some dislike the View Roll effect in Black Mesa, I love it. So what I&#39;m wondering, after both searching this forum and the interwebs, is if there is a mod, or way of ripping the effect out of BM, for attaining the same view roll effect in Half-Life 2 and it&#39;s associated episodes? I have seen the cl_viewroll command but it doesn&#39;t appear to work in source, or at least no longer works as of some update. Any information would be appreciated!

            <p>I know sv_rollangle works in some Source builds, but I’m not sure exactly which.</p>
