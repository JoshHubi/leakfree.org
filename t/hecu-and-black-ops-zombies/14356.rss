    <description>I have seen security zombies and scientists as well but Why aren&#39;t there any HECU and Black Operators zombies in the game?</description>

            <p>Let’s think about it …how much time does it take for the marine (and generally for other human host)  to become a zombie?<br>
Next … keep in mind that marines arrived only a few hours (or maybe more) after the resonance cascade, so there needs to be some more time for the marines to be “headhumped” and completely turned by the headcrabs…  the OF campaign starts cca 24 hours after the resonance cascade, so there was plenty of time for the marines to become infested … but that’s around the second half of the “Surface Tension” chapter … so basically there is almost no place left to put a marine zombie in the HL campaign … putting a marine zombie in f.e. On a Rail chapter is from the time period view point irrational …</p>
<p>“But why are there scientist and security zombies right after the resonance cascade?” - because there is unknown time that has passed between the very end of “Anomalus Materials” and  the beginning of “Unforseen Consequences” chapters…</p>
<p>please correct me if I have said something wrong</p>

<p>The concept of a HECU zombie doesn’t make sense to me. If a marine was infected the rest of the squad would put him down, unless he’s alone; which they rarely are.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well in Opposing Force there are quite many HECU Zombies the player encounters, so I don’t think it’d be such a rare incident to see them zombified, let alone feel out of place.</p>

            <p>There has been some talk on the forums at a point regarding the HECU Zombie. I’d like to see that in a future content update if possible, but judging after the fact that they haven’t been added and the game was released twice, it’s probably not going to happen. We’ll most likely see them only through mods.</p>
<p>As about the Black Ops assassins, they don’t exist in any of the original HLs. Also, it’s highly unlikely that they would fall victim to headcrabs due to their skill, and if someone is ever going to do such a thing, I think it will only give the game a strange feeling and feel out of place. We just don’t need them, the game is just fine how it is right now (without black ops assassins).</p>

            <p>Also, what makes you think the assassins would in any way fall victim to headcrabs? Have you seen how they move (and on higher difficulty levels, cloak)<br>
Grunts, I can see maybe becoming zombies. (though I don’t know where in the game there would be a decent place to replace existing zombies with them, most of the areas zombies exist are places they haven’t gotten down to)</p>

            <p>I guess because the devs are too busy to add them. Several people have talked about adding them via mod, though.</p>
<p>Although I don’t see why there would be Black Ops zombies, seeing as the only “Black Ops” encountered in-game are those weird assassins, and those are very rare.</p>
