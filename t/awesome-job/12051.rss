            <p>I almost wanted to hold off from playing it until Xen was released, but that was a battle I’d have had no chance in winning.</p>
<p>Enjoyed it very much as well. I get that unexplainable feeling that games from many years ago used to give me. The kind of feeling that most games nowadays are incapable of delivering.</p>
<p>I, personally, call it incomplete until Xen is here. I have faith that it will turn out even better than what we’ve played so far.</p>
