    <title>Because of the SFM:BM content release - are other dev teams allowed to use BM content</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/because-of-the-sfm-bm-content-release-are-other-dev-teams-allowed-to-use-bm-content/13459</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been curious of this for a long time now, but I never asked so I thought I would. Is the BM team sharing their content with (for instance) the Op:BM or Guard Duty team? Are the devs allowing this content to be used in other mods/remakes?

If not, does the SFM: Black Mesa DLC now give them permission to use that content in their games? Or is that CCL only for SFM use?</description>
