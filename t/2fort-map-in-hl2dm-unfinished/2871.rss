</aside>
<p>Right now the lighting is very monotonous, try having different colours; perhaps opening up the ramp room to let in the setting sun which would be orangey-red, which would contrast to the cold blue of combine lighting.</p>
<p>Also use combine props for the combine lighting; you didn’t see the combine colour being emitted from a civilian floodlight in HL2 did you?</p>
<p>Perhaps alter the architecture slightly so that it looks more like it came from the combine; I know it’s not an easy thing to do… really, I do, but since the map is quite basic at the moment, you should be able to make these changes a little easier.</p>

            <p>I’m working on the lighting and adding point_spotlights in. For the stairs, it’s kind of based on the TFC’s courtyard in 2fort, iirc, the ramps in there were ramps, not stairs. For the detail, I have no idea what to add in there.</p>

            <p>Sure looks ok… lol</p>
<p>Its way to dark IMO (lighting itself needs to be improve)</p>
<p>Needs more Detail add decals and some overlays</p>
<p>The Stairs could actually be Stairs not just a slope</p>
<p>I would like to see what u got right now</p>

            <p>HUGE BUMP: Hey guys, sorry for not updating this thread, but I was finishing up the bases, and now I’m pretty sure it’s done and I just need the sextures. I added some stuff under the bridge: <span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span> Also I added sextures to the rebel’s base, opinions?</p>

            <p>Straight to Gabe? Well, I wish you luck…!<br>
Not sure if he’s the best man for the question, so if that doesn’t work, a better bet would be anybody on <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/people.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this page</a> who says Level Designer by their name, <span class="bbcode-b">BUT EVEN BETTER would be Robin Walker and John Cook</span> (listed as Software Developers), who led TFC’s development. Of those two, I’d first try Robin Walker, since he’s listed as <span class="bbcode-i">“<span class="bbcode-u">design</span>, code, and management”</span>.</p>
<p>Actually, I’ve been doing some sleuthing… apparently some of the original TF’s more popular user-generated maps were assimilated into TFC. For example, I saw the map “The Rock, v2” available. It’s theoretically possible they don’t have it. But I’m assuming they do, considering how cleanly it was adapted into the final game and how it’s the most common <span class="bbcode-i">official</span> level.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m pretty sure that in racing games <em>mario kart</em> mirror mode is done simply by flipping the video output, sound, controls &amp; maybe textures, or at least the ones with writing on them. It’s simple, doesn’t take up any real space, and doesn’t require all of the effort that would go into remaking everything backwards.</p>

<p>but desire a bit of a challenge</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s not much of a challenge for a lot of people. In a report covering gender-HCI (genderbased human-computer-interaction), I came across some studies revealing how female computer users had a harder time at smaller computer resolutions than the male test counterparts. Both genders had degraded performance when navigating the virtual environment at smaller resolutions, but women moreso. The female subjects caught up to equal levels at a higher visible resolution &amp; field-of-view.</p>
<p>Female subjects operated with a more landmark-oriented method of navigating, relying on the placement of objects in relation to oneanother. The male subjects are believed to have performed better in small resolutions by choosing a more grid-based understanding, navigating by absolute bearing in the virtual environment.</p>
<p>It’s possible your approach would only baffle the several female players, since swapping a grid is arguably easier than reversing one’s understanding of relative locations.</p>
<p>No doubt both genders would have decreased performance compared to the original 2fort, but I feel one gender may be more thrown off by the concept. <span class="bbcode-b">YOU</span>, if you were to play an engineer, would be one of the few to have some improvement in this situation - - since a sentry’s performance remains identical. But you would hurt the rest of your gender.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, neither landmark- nor bearing-focused approach is superior. A combination is ideal, that is, a male bias and female bias navigating in tandem. Take the typical example of a couple bickering in the car…<br>
The female knows they are lost, since nothing is familiar. The male thinks he knows where he is, since he’s been driving on the same road (assumed rather straight). Unfortunately, he could have been completely disoriented since the road may have bent. Still, he thinks he knows where he is, so he refuses to ask for directions.</p>
<p>To prove a combination is ideal, well, if some landmark like a cell tower or the sun’s position were visible, the female landmark-bias would be able to correct a mistaken bearing.</p>

<p>Yeah, decompiling is ugly shit. Maybe when I’ve got my current map done with, I’ll look at rebuilding 2fort from those proportions, all objects from scratch. I always wanted to modify that bitch.</p>
<p>You <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> ask the old folks at Valve if they have the original RMF lying anywhere around… you have some historical rapport at Steampowered and continued influence as a BM dev, so they might recognize your request as being less than irrelevant… and they have nothing to lose by releasing it. If you got your hands on something like that, it’d save a lot of effort, and then your mirrored map would be a reality at the snap of a finger. Don’t make the RMF too public though or else you’ll get a bunch of unnecessary pseudo-authentic 2fort knockoffs…</p>

<p>Everyone bickered that it was just a simple swap to do, yet others insisted the map would have to be recreated from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Catzygirl, as someone who continues to touch TFC in the context of mapping, I’d like to share my thoughts on it…<br>
Decompiling the map is always a fugly process, there are some tools that can bring you close but you have to go through and delete rogue brushes while remaking walls that were deformed during the process.</p>
<p>Basically, there is some effort… but once that’s done, the swap is really really easy. The question is, why would that be time usefully spent? Everything that gets done in the game is pretty much symmetrical… I’ve debated this with my father before. In a game like Chess, it doesn’t matter whether the queen is on the left or right side of the king… the only demand is that the queens be in the same column. Since every piece can move left and right equally, then the possible moves are identical to a mirrored version.</p>
<p>It’s just not a fruitful mod, kinda like how I find the “mirrored mode” a waste in racing games. Running the track backwards is more interesting. That is to say, a better and more hilarious investment would be putting the bases ass-to-ass. Such that you enter the enemy basement through your basement, and your flag is at the end of a half-long bridge overlooked by the battlements.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I call it <span class="bbcode-b">2trof</span>…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span></span> I have a decompiled 2fort in front of me right now… 53 solids were invalid, not sure where they are, but those aren’t the worst part. What’s worse is how some objects came out. There are fuckups with the tedious things… mostly the lights and basement-girders… that would need to be resolved.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">EditEdit:</span></span> Actually, the map is only superficially okay. <span class="bbcode-i">Every</span> corner is a disastrous intersect of 1-unit-thick walls. There are more invalid solid structures than spawn points, and more perpendicular texture axes than textures multiplied by entities. The decompile is only really useful as a guide if you’re going to rebuild all of 2fort with exact dimensions and pre-existing texture alignments.</p>
