    <title>Another first elevator bug.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/another-first-elevator-bug/9627</link>
    <description>When entering the very first elevator in Unforseen Consequences, I wasn&#39;t all the way in the elevator, apparently, when I hit the button.  The elevator started, but then I received damage, presumably from getting smashed.  I didn&#39;t die, though.  But, the elevator stopped and then wouldn&#39;t move again.

I had to load the autosave right after the resonance cascade.</description>
