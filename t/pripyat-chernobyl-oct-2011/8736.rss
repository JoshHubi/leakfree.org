    <title>Pripyat, Chernobyl - Oct 2011</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pripyat-chernobyl-oct-2011/8736</link>
    <description>I visited Pripyat in October with a group of others, had a tour of the zone and free roam around Pripyat over two days. Pripyat is the workers village for those who worked at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

These are my photos.

On April 26th 1986 one of the four reactors at the Chernobyl power plant exploded. This then resulted in other explosions and the spread of nuclear contamination all over the surrounding area and even in other countries. There were many effects on people from all over. Many people who were at the plant trying to get the situation under control died from radiation poisoning within a few weeks of the accident. People hired to clean up the Chernobyl accident also had similar problems as they did not have proper protection. Now this plant and surrounding towns are abandoned and no-one can enter without permission from the government.

The town of Pripyat is a true ghost town. People left in a rush leaving personal items behind, believing they would be returning for their belongings soon. It has been as they left it for 20 years, save for some vandalism by the government in an attempt to stop looters. Windows were broken across the town to prevent radiation building up within the buildings.

There is a bridge between the Chernobyl plant and Pripyat which overlooks the reactors. When the disaster happened, many citizens of the town gathered on the bridge to watch, unaware of the danger. They all died within weeks of the accident.

<p>Great pictures, very nicely done. I read an article recently saying that Chernobyl and the area around it has essentially become an enormous wildlife sanctuary, since all creatures are affected by radiation but have a significantly shorter lifespan that humans so that it doesn’t affect them. Apparently it’s home to a particularly rare species of frog, though I’m sure other rare animals thrive there too.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I’d love to go, just because it’s strangely haunting and comforting, both to see the remnants of an entire city frozen in time, but also to know that as soon as we go, nature reclaims everything.</p>

<p>It depends what you want from an image host. I use Flickr because it’s a good mix of image hosting and social media for photographers, and I have yet to see anything done particularly badly. If I wanted pure hosting I have a website for that.</p>

<p>It’s also a one of a kind location, so scientists are learning all the time about how it will effect animals, nature and so on. We are constantly discovering new insect species around the world so it stands to reason that we would find new species of insect in the zone where they are actively being sought out on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Thanks for the comments everyone, given the opportunity it’s absolutely worth a visit.</p>

<p>To get there from Australia would probably be double that amount. Sounds like you fit in quite a lot of activities in a few days. Was it very cold when you went there?</p>

<p>Not really, no. They have cold winters but it was fine in October. Comfortable in a light weight jacket.</p>

I always get teased a bit more with every well made picture I get to see. I definitely want to go there.</p>
<p>But I thought Pripyat was opened to tourists last year? I thought radioactivity was small enough today that you could easily walk through the buildings without touching everything because most of it has been washed away by rain and air. I wouldn’t have imagined that there are still buildings in town with that high radioactivity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pripyat has been open to tourists in the past, but currently because of the work with the new sarcophagus they’ve closed the area for tourists officially. Hasn’t stopped anyone visiting though, or so it seems to me.</p>
<p>The govt. always seem to be looking for excuses to close the zone though. The buildings in Pripyat are becoming pretty structurally unsound now, and it’s a fairly common belief that when some of the larger or more well known buildings start to fall apart they’ll use that as an excuse to restrict visits even further.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, there were a few around. The most radioactive parts are the moss and cracks in the concrete more or less everywhere - moss absorbs everything. The hospital is fairly high because it acted as a shield for the radiation from the plant (at least up to a point) since it’s a long building on that edge of the town. There are also artifacts such as the claws from one of the cranes that was used to pull material from the reactor which are just sitting in the town for you to hug if you want to. I didn’t get a reading myself but you can probably find out the levels without too much difficulty if you’re interested.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was a kid in school and studied what happened at Chernobyl in modern history, Ive always been fascinated by the place… It’s one of the few places I absolutely must see with my own eyes before I die… Thanks for sharing these pics</p>

            <p>We went as a group of 36, and all in it probably cost £600. That’s flights, accommodation, spending money, food, everything.</p>
<p>2 days in the zone, staying in Slavutich - the modern workers village - then getting a train into the zone and a coach around it. We had around 8 hours free roaming in Pripyat itself. We also visited a missile silo come museum and stayed in a random hotel between that and Slavutich, and spent the final night in Kiev.</p>
<p>We had to go as a “scientific trip” though because they closed the zone to tourists. Basically the only difference was a trip to the labs in the zone for a talk about soil and animal analysis which was pretty interesting.</p>

            <p>Amazing photography, you’re very lucky to have had the chance to visit there. I’d like to go there some day and experience it for myself. Just out of curiosity, how much did it set you back go on the tour and stay in Kiev, if that’s where you stayed.</p>
