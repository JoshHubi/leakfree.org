    <title>Nepal Monastery HL1 song hunt</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/nepal-monastery-hl1-song-hunt/6649</link>
    <description>You know the one, that topside tentacle tune: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38P4rmxQiSQ[/url]

Well guess what, I heard that flute thing somewhere else.

Now, I&#39;ve heard a lot of bits of Half-Life&#39;s music recycled elsewhere. I&#39;m guessing Kelly Bailey had a number of generic sound samples to use. One of the most prevalent of these is the beginning of [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TojfumGWTX4&#39;]Adrenaline Horror[/url], used on countless episodes of Fear Factor and whatnot.

But I want another instance of the flute thing from [b]Nepal Monastery[/b].

I heard it as part of a [i]real[/i] song. I heard this song being played at an IMAX-dome showing, prior to the show/dimming-of-the-lights. It sounded like they had a whole CD playing, and that it was just one of the tracks with an eastern sort of vibe. I impressed my sister by whistling it predictively after the first few notes played. Oh yes, it was most definitely Nepal Monastery. Although it had the backdrop of a beat this time.


Any idea on how I can find that?</description>

            <p>Hahaaaaa!!! THAT’S IT!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  sounds a bit different on my laptop’s speakers compared to an IMAX dome, THAT’s for sure…!</p>
<p>THANK YOU GUYS! Orpheon, and especially Lukagerm!! I knew I couldn’t have been the only one to hear that kind of thing, recycled sounds used throughout Half-Life’s soundtrack.</p>
<p>Fascinating… “<span class="bbcode-i">Ali Baba and the 40 Ravers</span>”, eh… … … funny how these bits of music get dispersed.</p>

<p>There you go Tiki, the flute begins at about 2:04. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EastWest-Ravers-Audio-Sample-CD-ROM/dp/B0002GLHOU" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s a link</a> to that Ali Baba and the 40 Ravers thing…it’s an old CD full of Middle Eastern instrument samples. Both Kelly Bailey and Safri Duo must have used it.</p>
<p>I’ve always wondered about things like that, like the beginning city noise of Daft Punk’s “Da Funk” can be heard in the background of Gorillaz’s “Dare” near the end. They probably just used the same stock sound resource.</p>

            <p>Heyhey I found it!</p>
<p>I had no luck on youtube either so I dug out the old CD. The track with the flute is called Snakefood.</p>
<p>Here’s what it says in the insert regarding Snakefood:<br>
“Ney flute sample is taken from ‘Ali Baba and the 40 Ravers’ from Best Service (Soundwave Company).”</p>

<p>That flute’s been used in a Safri Duo song.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Do you happen to know which one? I went on youtube and listened to some songs but I couldn’t find that flute tune.</p>
<p>If what you’re saying is true though, it could be they had a Safri Duo CD playing at the theater Tiki was at. It’s more of an island type of music, but he could have remembered it as Middle Eastern. Somewhat similar.</p>
