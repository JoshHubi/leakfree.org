<p>It’s not the problem he doesn’t know how to build a server, it’s not a problem he doesn’t know how to config Apache (or IIS) and it certainly is not the problem that he’s asking how to do it.</p>
<p>The real problem, for me, lies in the fact that he doesn’t show any initiative. Nothing like: "o hey i googled some but there’s contradicting info, could you guys help me out?"or “hey, i try to start hosting, i got these stuffs, am i missing something?” It’s more like: “how does i webhosting l0lol”</p>

            <p>You’ll definitely need a hella fast internet connection if you plan on doing web hosting.</p>
<p>Also, ISP’s generally frown upon hosting a server on their network, I’ve heard cases where the cut of people’s internet because they chew up so much bandwidth. Talk to your ISP about setting up a server, and if they allow it.</p>

            <p>protip: if you need guides to set it up, you shouldn’t be trying in the first place.</p>
<p>but besides that, your audience is probably not too big. expect your hardware to cost some €2000 for a pretty decent server with remote management functions and a decent backup-device (i.e. tape with a good backup strategy, anything else IS NOT a backup, just a failsafe).</p>
<p>it is explicitely up to you to figure out what kind of hardware you should buy and what kind of backup plan you should be having. if you cannot figure that out, stay the fuck away from the hosting market.</p>
