    <title>&quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; for Win95 under Win7 - an issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/earthworm-jim-for-win95-under-win7-an-issue/13366</link>
    <description>Hey, all. On one of the levels the game does not work properly, making for an impossibility of continuation of progress in it: On the Second level (as the game menu indicates), which looks like Hell, there is a need to run on top of a spinning precious stone (I looked how to pass it on-line, on YouTube, in a walkthrough), and the gaming character does keep sliding off the stone, despite my numberless attempts. Is there a way to, perhaps, get a compatibility layer program (I guess that would cost some money), and forget the compatibility issues?</description>

            <p>Yes VirtualBox is extremely easy to set up if you’ve ever installed windows before. (just mount the CD drive, insert windows install CD/DVD, install in virtual machine)</p>
<p>By the way, I was able to complete Half life under windows 98 on dosbox, but it took months of tweaking and is generally still considered impossible to boot up Win98SE on dosbox with hardware graphics and sound acceleration without the windows HAL layer crashing. Although some people claim to have booted up Windows NT 4.0 on dosbox, I think it’s a myth.</p>

<p>Well yeah, DOSBox would be easier but you can’t use DOSBox with the Windows 95 version. He’d have to get the Steam or GoG version, which already uses DOSbox and would defeat the purpose of him having the CDs.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah I know, I was just pointing it out because sometimes it’s worth paying a little money to avoid a lot of work. But if VirtualBox is free, isn’t too big a hassle to set up, and will work properly, then that might be worth it.</p>

            <p>Just get VirtualBox, it’s a free VM solution that can run Win95 without too much hassle.</p>

<p>You could try emulating Windows 95 and running the game inside that emulation. I think that’s possible.</p>
<p>Also it looks like this game was released for DOS as well as Windows and the digital versions (GoG and Steam) are both the DOS versions running with DOSBox. Considering the game uses a password system instead of save games, you could find a download for the GoG version and continue playing in there.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>DOSBox would definitely be easier. Unless there’s another way I’m not aware of, you’d have to acquire a VM software (which you might have to pay for), create a virtual machine, and install Windows 95 on it. But even then I’m not certain if you’d be able to get all the functionality you need out of it, like if you can access the physical CD from the virtual machine. I’ve never tried to run a virtual machine of anything older than XP/Server 2003. If you really wanted to try running Windows 95, it’d probably be more of a safe bet to find an ancient computer from Goodwill or something and install it on that.</p>

<p>In regards to 2, I think he was asking, are you sure that you’ve done everything you need to in the game to advance past this point? Like, was there maybe something you needed to do <span class="bbcode-i">before</span> attempting to cross this obstacle?</p>
