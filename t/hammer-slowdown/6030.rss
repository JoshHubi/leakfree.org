    <title>Hammer slowdown</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hammer-slowdown/6030</link>
    <description>I have recently been noticing some severe slowdown while trying to map with Hammer. I have done all the options in &#39;Properties&#39; and have reinstalled hammer. It starts a few seconds after the editor is opened, it is basically severe slow down, making it nearly impossible to work with. It&#39;s a recent problem, I was having no trouble until a couple of weeks ago, and it seems to affect all the versions of the engine. (EP2, EP1, etc)

I am running Windows 7 64 bit. 

Any help would be appreciated. 

Thank you.</description>

            <p>so does it lag ingame? Im just trying to figure out whats causing it, and i doubt its hammer unless youve changed something.<br>
So check all your temps, check everything, cpu speed, ram speed etc…</p>
<p>unless cameron has some sort of clue, im leaning towards a hardware or driver issue.</p>

<p>Completely new levels, just drawing a box causes severe slow down.</p>
<p>I closed all other programs, and cancelled all unnessesary programs running in the background.</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Duo <span class="mention">@2.93</span> GHz<br>
4GB of Ram<br>
132 GB free of 456(HDD)</p>
<p>I can’t imagine it being anything wrong with the specs though, as Hammer has been working perfectly for over a year on the same system. I have ran I virus scan, as well as done the obvious stuff like Disk Defragmentation and Disk Cleanup.</p>

            <p>Just so you know, youve currently said, “hammer lags, it started happening 2 weeks ago, i have win7 x64, i reinstalled hammer and it didnt fix it.”</p>
<p>we need your systems specs, you also need to check if your cpu and ram is free. So close everything you dont need running.<br>
now try openning your map. Still slow? hide a huge section of your map. does that help? if not, try doing a virus scan.</p>
<p>post cpu, ram and hdd size (is hdd full?)</p>
