            <p>Have you already contacted steam support? It would have taken you the same time to ask them this question, as it did to make this thread.<br>
But hey, maybe someone here can help.</p>

            <p>Not 100% sure I got it right, but if you mean that you can see the game in your library but it does not say that you already have the game in a green box on the store page that is normal for pre-purchase. It says the same for my copy of homefront.</p>
