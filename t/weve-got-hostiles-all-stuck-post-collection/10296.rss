    <description>At the beginning of this chapter across from the Silo D blast door there is a security office with a shotgun which I do not have yet (website said it becomes available in office complex but it is the magnum..not the shotgun). I want it and upon further observation in storage room 1 just past the Silo D area I can see that the light is green on the back door to this office and there is a vent above I believe I can crawl out of...go down the catwalk like area and down the stairs and gain access through the back secutiry door. If anyone is familiar and can tell me how to find the enterance to this vent that would be great. I have already tried breaking door windows and crawling through...I know it has to do with that vent...Thanks</description>

            <p>Thanks, but I did that on the many doors leading to here and tried it here as well. Door will not open. Pressed use, shot it,  used the crowbar on it. The turret is jammed in there but I doubt that matters?</p>

            <p>I know the answer will be easy but I am stumped. Stuck between storage room 2 and 3. Assumed the elevator was it but can’t grab the ladder, no pipes to climb on, etc. Thanks in advance.</p>
