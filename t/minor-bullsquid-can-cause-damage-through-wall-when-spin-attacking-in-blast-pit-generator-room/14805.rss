    <title>[MINOR] Bullsquid can cause damage through wall when spin-attacking in Blast Pit generator room</title>

    <description>Apologies if this has been reported numerous times but I did do a search but couldn&#39;t find any related threads. You most likely currently want STU bugs reported.

I&#39;ve just experienced a minor glitch when playing the Blast Pit chapter. In the generator room there is a single Bullsquid. If you open the door and quickly leave the doorway to take cover, the Bullsquid can still damage you through the wall during a spin attack. At first I thought it was a prop that it had smashed through the door but if you stand to the left of the door switch it can still hit you through the wall.

Also within the same map there is a very minor graphical glitch with two monitors where the scientist is hiding. They don&#39;t appear as if they are behind the glass as the cross-hatched texture is not displayed in front of them. Sorry, its nothing game-breaking but just stood out.   :slight_smile:
