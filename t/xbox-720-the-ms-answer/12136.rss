    <title>XBOX 720: The MS answer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xbox-720-the-ms-answer/12136</link>
    <description>I wonder what to expect of the new Xbox....

They gonna use the GDDR5 aswell, instead of GDDR3, now they know the PS4 has it?

Rumors tell us April is the month MS gonna reveal their new console aswell.

I wonder if they gonna show their console, where Sony did not...

I&#39;m really looking forward to the new console, as to their new Kinect!

I think both consoles are up to eachother, almost the same specs used!

Well, what do u think about it?</description>

<p>The problem is, the more and more advanced the graphics and get, the harder it gets to add depth because you can only have so many art assets.</p>
<p>As an example, in an old game like Doom or Unreal, there were secret passage everywhere because a secret passage was nothing more complicated than a few moving brushes. These days, you pretty much need a whole new asset for a secret passage like that, and then you can only use it once or twice, because otherwise players will learn to look for that one bookshelf model that’s always the entrance to a secret room.</p>
<p>As for scripted sequences, those are used because it’s the only really practical way to add highly detailed scenes with lots of movement and animation and action is to make them fully scripted. It’s very hard to have that same amount of depth in normal gameplay. The necromorph grapples in Dead Space or Alyx’s zombie moves in EP1 onwards are good examples of this; they’re detailed, scripted scenes that can be activated dynamically, but even they get tired after a while because there are only so many of them.</p>

            <p>I guess the first games appearing on the scene will have the graphics of the Xbox360, as the PS4 has those of the PS3</p>
<p>It’s all about rumors, they said PS4 would have 4GB of RAM, it has 8GB…</p>
<p>So I wonder how true the specs of the XBOX720 are, except the Kinect ones (maybe leaked by MS itself to get the eyes of the PS4 announcement)</p>

            <p>All I want from this generation of games are good, smooth controls, clean and pleasing visuals, straightforward but deep gameplay, engaging stories and characters and, most of all, tons of new innovative I.P.s that don’t suck dick and comply to my above requirements.</p>
<p>Gimmicks like motion control or virtual reality should be used in a smart and well planned way.</p>

<p>The more freedom the player is allowed, the bigger the chance to introduce unpredictable bugs. Testing and bugfixing take time and money, and there are few developers that have any kind of freedom where those are concerned.<br>
Trust me, coding complex game mechanic systems is a lot more interesting than copy pasting shit all over the place, doesn’t mean anyone’s willing to pay for that.<br>
The people who call the shots are thinking in different terms entirely when they make the choices and somehow I suspect that level of abstraction only deals with the revenue numbers.</p>

            <p>It’s time to stop giving a fuck about specs and start messing with gameplay and new ways to get the game into your head.</p>
<p>I know it feels like the corporations are swinging at the wind with there peripheral wars and all that bullshit, but there truly is more to gaming than a screen and an interface that involves buttons. There has to be something better, and finding that is more important than a brick made of copper and silicon.</p>

            <p>The specs of the PS4 are fine.</p>
<p>Perceptible graphics increases are going to continue to slow down. We are the point where games look good enough that large leaps in visuals like we got in the 90’s are going to take 10-100X the processing power we currently have. We’ll see that happen in our lifetime, but not over the next 7 or so years of the console life cycle. It’s going to be a very slow, steady crawl upward.</p>
<p>The last thing people should be worrying about are the graphics specs on these things. There are way bigger concerns, like how the online systems (store, friends, etc.) work, or what kind of controllers they’ll use.</p>

            <p>i think these consoles are tremendously underpowered</p>
<p>i think video game graphics are gonna improve so much that sony and M$ will be forced to render the games on their side with expensive PC farms and stream it to the consoles just like “onlive”</p>

            <p>I have this weird feeling that Microsoft is going to blow it. I think the objective success of the Kinect has put them in the wrong headspace, and I don’t think they’ve noticed that it’s already suffering from Wii syndrome, where it sold like hotcakes and then turned into a dust collector.</p>
<p>The upcoming generation of consoles are going to live and die on making developers happy. Sony seems to get this (though the reality remains to be seen). I don’t think Microsoft does. I think Microsoft is going to try to reinvent the wheel so they can sell more gadgets and totally fuck up their platform. I hope my spidey sense is wrong.</p>
