A [url=&#39;https://ukranews.com/ru/news/ukraine/2011/12/09/59663&#39;]Ukranian news site[/url]  is reporting that the developers of Stalker and Stalker 2, GSC have  shut down their studio. An “informed source” told them that founder and  CEO, Sergei Grigorovich made the announcement at a staff meeting, saying  that the company was closing because of unspecified “personal reasons.”  [url=&#39;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/12/09/wuh-oh-gsc-stalker-2-dead/&#39;]RPS[/url] spotted a [url=&#39;https://twitter.com/#%21/gscstalker/status/145156370390454272&#39;]tweet[/url]  from the company denying that GSC has been closed, but that has since  been deleted. If true, it would be a sudden and very sad turn of events.  We’ll know what’s happening for certain when GSC make official comment

            <p>I don’t know how you feel about it, but without Stalker Complete, Shadow of Chernobyl felt rather broken IMO. It had tons of potential and great atmosphere, but it was a pretty obvious beta. Once the AI was tweaked, bugs fixed, localization improved, features added, and graphics improved, then it was stunning. Of course, it wasn’t a port like Skyrim, but it had its fair share of problems nonetheless.</p>
<p>Also, Skyrim and Stalker may have some overlapping traits, but I don’t think the core appeal is the same. Stalker is about fighting for your life on your own in a bleak, hostile environment that lives and breathes on its own and cares little what happens to you. Skyrim is about working your way to the pinnacle of whatever path you choose and having some adventures along your way to be the Big Damn Hero. I think that would be the real problem here - not that Bethesda would make another Stalker game left riddled with bugs and lackluster graphics, but that the core appeal of the game might be changed.</p>

            <p>Skyrim was not a good PC port. The UI is terrible, the shadows physically hurt my eyes to look at, the default and even HD textures aren’t very good, the draw distance is like 10 feet in front of you, and the world is pretty empty.</p>
<p>I don’t care if you can fix some of that stuff with mods. I found the game itself pretty boring to play and I’m not going to praise a mediocre game just because it has mod tools. Stalker is a good game. I have only ever used visual enhancement mods with it. I don’t want Bethesda pouring their mediocrity onto my favorite game series and people saying “It’s okay if the game sucks because you can mod it!” like they do with Bethesda’s games.</p>
<p>I actually think the contrast between the communities is kind of funny. Stalker’s community thrives on the random things that the AI does in the game. It’s easy to have something happen in the game and then get together to tell stories. There are quite a few total conversion mods for the games but again, most of the discussion is about cool things that happen while you’re playing and about the atmosphere of the game. Now if you take Skyrim’s community right now, I mostly see people trying to say that their game looks beautiful because of how much they modded it or just bragging about how many mods they have active at a time. Glitches are another point of conversation. And so many of the pictures people post are of overly post-production effected posed naked women. I just find the image amusing.</p>

<p>Oh don’t worry, I’m sure Bethesda can do great things for the STALKER series!<br>
For example:</p>
<p>It’ll be a PC game turned Console based. Will undoubtedly have a bad port that looks shittier than the original trilogy.<br>
It’ll be the exact same game as every other Bethesda Embryo/Creation engine title, with some weapons and (arguably) textures swapped.<br>
It will play like a slug on acid wading through marmite.<br>
It’ll have movement mechanics and animations that would belong in Monty Python’s Ministry of Silly Walks.<br>
It’ll be More heavily infested with bugs than your grandmother’s crotch.<br>
There’ll be Five+ sets of DLC that will all be timed exclusive to Xbox. Expect PC version of DLC to be worsely ported than the original game.<br>
You can expect a horrifyingly droll leveling system where non should be present at all.<br>
Not to mention that more effort spent on cleverly-hidden easter eggs and cultural references than on actual game development.<br>
You can rest easy knowing that it’ll be marketed as having amazing new graphical features that were present in the original STALKER game (see original bullet point).<br>
Also, It will include some new gameplay feature that is supposed to make the game intuitive but instead makes the player feel like a ponce.<br>
Redditors will be overjoyed to know it’s guaranteed to have annoying catchphrases that will become an overused meme on day one of release.<br>
You can feel comfortable with the same missions and dungeons (Or in STALKER universe, Laboratories) 200 times.<br>
Don’t worry about the AI either! you’ll never have to take cover-based shooting when fighting any of these enemies. They’ll all justsidestep back n forth until you kill them all.<br>
And of course, for the sake of individuality, you’ll get a customizable Character that will be permanently covered in an Bodysuit and gasmask within the first five minutes.</p>
<p>I’m confident that STALKER 2 will be fanfuckingtastic.</p>

            <p>Besides some low res textures Call of Pripyat looks phenomenal still, though it came out two/three years later. And Crysis came out in 2007 as well.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but I think we’d all be a bit pissed off if Half Life 3 comes out on the same HL2 engine.  Sure, it runs smooth on old systems, but when do you stop and say “Hey, we need to keep up or else we’ll get left behind?”</p>
<p>I’m not big on graphics.  I still think the original Crysis looks amazing.<br>
Crysis came out back in 2008 and I think it still holds up.  STALKER came out in 2007.  I’d say it didn’t hold up too well visually a couple of years after its release and yet 5 years later they still seem to be raping the same system.<br>
Plus the fact that the Xray Engine is buggy as shit…STILL!</p>

<p>Of course, graphics are not the most important thing in a game, but it really does look like an old engine.</p>

            <p>The problem is that it’s now a F2P MMO. It might have been the only way they could have gotten funding though, so I suppose Survarium is better than nothing.</p>
