<p>Yeah, there’s another vent like it in <span class="bbcode-i">Blast Pit</span>. I guess from what you can see inside those vents, you don’t want to be climbing in. Vent-monster?</p>
<p>And I’m glad I’m not the only person here who uses the word “inept.”</p>

            <p>It depends what door. However if I’m not mistaken, nearly all Tripmines in WGH (and most of the game for that matter) are avoidable by jumping (crouch jumping, a regular jump will not be enough to clear the mine’s beam) or crouching. Same goes for Sentry trip lasers.</p>

            <p>I’m long, LONG past this section by now, but for future reference…<br>
Is there any way to get around the proximity mines by the fire doors without setting them off?<br>
I’ve tried jumping, but the HEV suit seems to be much heavier in this version  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . I’ve also tried to jam them open with barrels, but the doors must be magnetic, for they fly away on contact. In one part I could use the conveyor belts to bypass the door, but that’s it.</p>

            <p>Did you try to clean your browser cache? The problem with the special characters in the wiki links has been solved a long time ago… maybe some old cookie or cache data is affecting your access.</p>
<p>You can try this also:</p>

<p>It’s impossible to go through there. Believe me, due to my memories of HL1 and coming out of that vent from the original, I thought there’d be something cool back there, and I’ve tried to get in there. Looks like there’s just an invisible wall there.</p>

<p>I’ve tried running and jumping (both crouching and not), every single time I get to the ladder, my character doesn’t latch onto it. I’ve also tried running + jumping/crouch-jumping to the little ledge next to the ladder and haven’t had success with that. I’ve looked around the room and it doesn’t seem there’s any other way out.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Yep. I am pretty much completely stuck here as well. Scientist runs under crate and stops, but soldier never comes out and elevator never appears. No way around this. Broken.</p>

            <p>At least the player is in a position to empty the current pistol clip into that soldier’s brain before he can react.<br>
It would have been cool and hilarious to be able to squish the guy.</p>

<p>I remember one of the Devs (Ram, I think) saying that they tried to make player interaction very intuitive, e.g. buttons you CAN’T push have RED lights and buttons you CAN push have GREEN lights, etc.  That said…are you supposed to be able to push this button?  To me, this looks like a game of “squish the soldier” but try as I might, no amount of “using” this button will drop the crane on his head.  Also tried shooting the supporting cable - no dice.</p>
<p>Wishful thinking?</p>

<p>Yup, I tried that too. It’s remarkably counter-intuitive.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I thought the same thing, but after multiple tries assumed that it didn’t work. Seemed like the perfect set-up  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Take a screenshot, I have problems remembering exactly what place you are in.<br>
But my main question would be, have you really checked the whole area?</p>
