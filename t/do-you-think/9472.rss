            <p>No, no, and more no.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   I’m a dev for Tripminestudios, and we’re not affiliated in any way, other than a shared interest in modding and HL, with the Black Mesa team.  We’ve tried to stress this on our moddb page, and even here on these forums as much as possible.</p>
<p>But yes, we are all just as excited about this releases as everybody else, and the inspiration will certainly be a big push for all of us to get Guard Duty and OBM out the door as fast as possible.  (and yet, in as vague of a timeframe as possible, true to Valve and BMS form)</p>

            <p>No. I give it zero chance to happen.<br>
But it’s bound to receive more attention after BM releases. And probably that’ll help refresh their enthusiasm to work on their project.</p>

            <p>They’re separate projects, and releasing both at the same time wouldn’t be smart as the audience would be divided. Even if for some reason they were to be released near each other, one would have to be at least a week or so away from the other.</p>
