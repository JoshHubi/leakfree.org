            <p>It’s not gonna die. It’s just another universe of adaptations. Just like with novels. The adaptations aren’t gonna stop as long as there’s material to adapt.</p>

<p>Lol you noticed too?</p>
<p>I… didn’t mind the film. Decent, as in same awfully dry, but watchable shit as Dark Knight.<br>
But tbh, this whole superhero movie craze should’ve died after Iron Man 2.</p>

</aside>
<p>That doesn’t sound right. I’ve seen a fair number of older comics, and they’re almost invariably much lighter in tone then modern comics. Darker and edgier and all that.</p>

            <p>It’s one of those movies where I love everything but the script so I can only rely on its face value for entertainment. All I can do is hope the crew stays the same the next time around and they have a better writer.</p>

<p>It wasn’t what I expected either, I expected a sophisticated film that would deal with the issues of being a complete outsider, being accepted into society, etc, but none of that was really focused on as much as it should’ve been.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t like the overt religious theme that it had. It’s okay to use whatever themes you want to in art, but with Superman posing as if he was on a cross, with one of the villains ranting about how morality is Superman’s weakness and how “evolution always wins”, implying that evolution = moral decline, and some other things, it all just felt out of place, silly, and excessive.</p>
<p>That said, it was not a bad film, but it was just a popcorn flick. Not the thrilling epic I expected.</p>

            <p>Saw it yesterday and I found it to be quite a shitty movie.</p>
<p>Truth be told: I have never really liked Superman, but I was still expecting a properly structured and entertaining movie. It was neither.</p>
<p>Also, the CGI in some parts was laughably bad. At some point you get a shot of him flying over the Serengeti planes and it actually looks like some 60s blue-screen nonsense.</p>
<p>On that note, what the fuck was that? He takes off on the Arctic, next shot he’s in Africa, next shot he’s at the cliffs of Dover, then he’s on some icy planes again, then he’s flying over the Rocky Mountains (I think?). Was he lost or something?</p>

            <p>It wasn’t what I expected either, I expected a sophisticated film that would deal with the issues of being a complete outsider, being accepted into society, etc, but none of that was really focused on as much as it should’ve been.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t like the overt religious theme that it had. It’s okay to use whatever themes you want to in art, but with Superman posing as if he was on a cross, with one of the villains ranting about how morality is Superman’s weakness and how “evolution always wins”, implying that evolution = moral decline, and some other things, it all just felt out of place, silly, and excessive.</p>
<p>That said, it was not a bad film, but it was just a popcorn flick. Not the thrilling epic I expected.</p>

            <p>Entertaining, but it was scarcely a Superman movie. And yeah, apparently superheroes have to stop villains at any cost now, meaning they’ll rack up as much cost as they can. I guess this is the ‘gritty realism’ everyone loves so much. If I wanted grit and reality I’d watch the news.</p>

            <p>He didn’t save as many people as he should have, and caused a lot of the destruction himself. He told everyone to get off the streets, and then threw the bad guys into the surrounding buildings…</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, but what the fuck really?</p>

            <p>Wasn’t as good as I thought it would be, it felt like a less structured version of Thor, thoughts?</p>
