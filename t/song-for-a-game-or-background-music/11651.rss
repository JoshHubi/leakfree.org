    <description>Hey guys, 

  I am a musician/singersongwriter. I&#39;m looking to get into video games by hopefully having something to offer with music. 

  Let me know what you guys think of this quip. Would you mind hearing it in a video game?

            <p>Thank you for the compliment. A puzzle game is a good idea too. I will probably write and record more quips and then see about posting on Moddb to work with some developing teams.</p>
<pre><code>  If anyone is looking for a musician to write for their game no matter the scale of the project let me know. I have musical theory training and 12+ years of writing experience.</code></pre>

            <p>That’s some pretty good music, but I’m honestly not sure that it’s that appropriate for a video game specifically.</p>
<p>It might be good for a slow-paced, exploration/puzzle game, like the guy above said, but I can’t really think of a theme that it would fit into.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response. Yup, there are two acoustic guitars, each track is layered to give it more depth.</p>
<p>You bring up a good point. I guess I could see a Chrono Trigger esq type of game. RPG.</p>

            <p>Are those live instruments?</p>
<p>As to you question, it’s hard to see exactly what kind of game it might fit into, so it’s hard to say if I’d like to hear it in a video game. It’s not very Black Mesa-ish, for example (IMO), but maybe some kind of tranquility thing where you spend lots of time wandering the countryside and solving puzzles or what have you.</p>
<p>Keep at it - the only way you’ll get your answer is to keep trying.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
