    <title>Black Mesa + GTX 680</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-gtx-680/11190</link>
    <description>Hi so I just purchased an EVGA nvidia 680 GTX SC Signature edition (2gb version). Basically, the card is completely underwhelming. So much so that I actually think it&#39;s faulty. 

My setup is as follows 
win 7 64 bit 
I7 980 3.33 ghz 
12gb Gskill Ram (let me know if you need more details) 
850W Corsair PSU 
Asus P6T mobo 

And, then, obviously, the video card in question. 

So, concerning the BMS in particular, if any of you with a setup similar to mine could do a quick test it would be greatly appreciated. 

Basically, quick save in the middle of the Lambda Core Teleportor fight. Specifically at some time when the machine is towards its final stages (e.g. lots of fancy effects) you are getting shot at etc. Then I would like you to load it. When you load, see if the framerate has dropped astronomically, particularly when you look at the core, taking at least 60 seconds to recover. 

I know this might be stupid, but I need to make sure this is a hardware issue, not a compatibility one.</description>

            <p>The same issue happens at the end of apprehension where you’re fighting the female assassins. Probably caused by the same thing.</p>

            <p>I don’t get noticeable frame drops anywhere in the game (even after dying in the last room) except after the levelchange in the elevator leading to the “pump A and B” puzzle in Lambda Complex, and when going back to that map after flooding each reactor. Running Sapphire 6870.</p>

            <p>It only happens in the final battle before the Xen teleporter room.<br>
If you die and load an auto save the game becomes choppy. Have to restart the game to fix it.<br>
Known issue…as people have been saying.</p>

            <p>Huh. I have a GTX 560 and the game runs fucking flawlessly. I haven’t noticed any stuttering or framerate drops at all in the past month.</p>

            <p>560Ti here, same issue. Terrible frame rate looking at the centre of that giant room. I don’t think that 2009 and MP are available for mods yet. Just 2006 and 2007.</p>
