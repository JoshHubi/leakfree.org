    <title>The Uplink Demo: Who loves it?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-uplink-demo-who-loves-it/3693</link>
    <description>It was my first experience with Half-Life: The Uplink demo

And I have to say, I loved it (even more than the final game itself) and was very disappointed, that it was cut.

In my opinion, it had a great design (especially the communications hall in the beginning), a good atmosphere, nice events (the bombing run at the beginning or as Hgrunts welded through a door) and a good story with a elaborated mission.

To have a more mission-based storyline with two other side kicks you want to escape with, than only have to make your own way to escape from BM, was great.

Only Blue Shift picked this idea up again, but it wasn&#39;t nearly as good implemented from my point of view.

What do you think? Are you an Uplink lover too?

And does anyone knows about a mod, that extends the Uplink mission?
I only know Uplink Extended, but this one was short, too.</description>

            <p>I was quite amazed how much detail was put into Uplink. The brutal scientist executions, the burning of alien corpses, the unique scripted sequences and of course the daring escape from the uplink station.</p>

            <p>I wasn’t going to post it, just mention it, but yeah. I tried the REAL Half-Life demo a while ago and it was HORRIBLE.</p>
<p>max screen resolution was like 800x600, no widescreen support, I can’t remember if it even supported opengl, and it had no gamepad support to speak of, nor could it even handle mouse4 and mouse5 buttons. It was Sooooooo much nicer playing through the Mod recreation of the demo.</p>

            <p>I played Uplink for the first time only a few months ago. I never knew about it until it was a discussion on here. I liked it for its camera tilt, which I’m sad that it wasn’t included in HL1, but at least it’s going to be in Black Mesa.</p>
<p>I never finished it. I got to… killing the security guard.</p>
