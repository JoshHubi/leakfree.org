    <title>is there a way to install the retail version without re-downloading the whole thing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-there-a-way-to-install-the-retail-version-without-re-downloading-the-whole-thing/14999</link>
    <description>as the title implies - i&#39;ve had the mod version for a while, bought the retail version and haven&#39;t actually installed it yet since i didn&#39;t want to re-download the whole thing.
i&#39;ve gone through a similar procedure before with other games that weren&#39;t sourcemods, but trying with BMS today i haven&#39;t been able to get steam to recognize the files i already have. (mind you, what i did so far is put the BMS folder in steamapps/common, renamed it to Black Mesa, tricked steam into generating an appmanifest with the game&#39;s id, restarted steam, then attempted the installation)

i do realize there are some files that i&#39;m going to have to download either way, but i&#39;m currently on 300 gigs per month on a network with 3 other people (not my choice of internet plan) and so the full 13 gigs is something i&#39;d like to avoid downloading unless i really have to. i feel like this was probably a common inquiry when the retail version first came out, but i haven&#39;t been able to find any information here, on the wiki or on the steam community</description>

            <p>The Mod version and the Retail Version are two completely separate entities at this point. They use different Engines, have different Maps and Models, and Retail even has Multiplayer now.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, but if you want to play the Retail Version, you will have to download and install it from Steam.</p>
<p>To understand the comparison:</p>
