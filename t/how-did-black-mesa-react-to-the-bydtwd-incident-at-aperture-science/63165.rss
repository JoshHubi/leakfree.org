    <title>How did Black Mesa react to the BYDTWD incident at Aperture Science?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-did-black-mesa-react-to-the-bydtwd-incident-at-aperture-science/63165</link>
    <description>As far as i am aware the Black Mesa incident happened after the BYDTWD. I&#39;ve been wondering for quite some time now how Black Mesa reacted to that incident. Obviously they were competitors so it wouldn&#39;t have been that off for Kleiner to make a comment about it at the Borealis debate in Half Life 2 Episode 2.
Due to the lack of acknowledgement of the incident from Black Mesas side I am wondering wehter the BYDTWD incident is actually known in the Half Life universe.

What are your thoughts on this?
Also why didn&#39;t the combine try to get into Aperture Science?</description>
