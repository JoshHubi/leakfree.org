            <p>I hope a future arrangement for that Oklahoma band includes a reference to Kirby’s Epic Yarn.</p>
<p>It’s kind of a match for what they were doing.</p>

            <p>This means I am going to be the best trumpet player ever known. My logic is sound, right?</p>

            <p>No one other than Lincoln’s close friends knew he was constantly and severely depressed ever since he was 23. Still the greatest leader the country has ever known.</p>

            <p>Introversion is nice. No one knows when I’m depressed. Still, all our marching band does is Star Wars (last year) and Disney (this year.)</p>

            <p>The whole country has been going that route, unfortunately. Music &amp; Arts are slowly … or, well, have already mostly been snuffed out of most schools in the name of athletic clubs. Ironically, “recess” doesn’t really exist anymore, which probably creates more introverted individuals more in tune with stuff like music &amp; arts.</p>
<p>I miss my quad.</p>

            <p>I wish my Marching Band did this.<br>
Too bad I live in a small, poor town (we call our selves a city, mainly because we gave the entire country oil with the first oil well and all,) that is more focused on hunting and football than anything that matters.</p>
