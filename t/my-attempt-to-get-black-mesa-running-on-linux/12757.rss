    <title>My attempt to get Black Mesa running on Linux</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-attempt-to-get-black-mesa-running-on-linux/12757</link>
    <description>Hello everybody, as the title says, im made it to make Black Mesa running native under Linux (open SUSE 13.1) [b]EVEN WITHOUT SOURCE SDK BASE 2007[/b], what I do is this.
-[i]Have installed Half-Life 2[/i]
-Uncompressed the .7z in a folder (doesn’t matter the place)
-manually backup the hl2 folder (inside Half-Life 2)
-overwrite the HL2 models, materials, sounds[b]*[/b], resources, scripts and maps with the BMS folders.
-run Half-Life 2 with console enable.
[b]EDIT[/b]: run any map (in my test case, second map of AM)
[i]*unfortunately the sound still making bugs because hl2 on Linux doesn’t recognize the files.[/i]
Unfortunately I also have a lots of error (but most of them are the same error that you could have under Windows with the same procedure)
-Sometimes the NPCs doesn’t appear.
-The scripts sequences aren’t loaded, so [b]randomly when a sequence starts, the game shut down.
[/b]
Right now im trying to running with the official SDK 2007 for Linux, this time i installed in the correct folder ([i]Sourcemods[/i]) immediately steam recognize the game as &quot;Black Mesa&quot; and start installing automatic the Base 2007. I hope tomorrow brig you more answers or if somebody knows something about this or is also tryning to make this please write in the comments and thanks.</description>

not really what you could call “porting” or “modding”.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Black Mesa doesn’t require the Source SDK Base 2007 per se.  It requires a Source game, or the Source SDK.  Since you have installed Half-Life 2, you have a Source game, you don’t need the SDK Base.  The same goes for Windows.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is not enough.  Black Mesa has also made some engine modifications, which is C++ code compiled for the Windows platform.  You cannot get this working on Linux without recompiling the code (and possibly rewriting parts of it).  For this, you would need the code, which is not available publicly.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>These are probably caused by the different game resources (scripts, maps) being dependent on certain engine modifications and/or features which are not present in Half-Life 2.  Keep in mind that, regardless of what files you copied, you are still running Half-Life 2.  Just without the game content.</p>

<p>What you are doing is creative.  And as an open source enthusiast, I definitely agree this game should be available in Linux.  But what you are trying to do is <span class="bbcode-b">impossible for you</span>.  You are wasting your time.</p>
<p>The Black Mesa source code needs to be ported and recompiled for the Linux platform.  Since you don’t have the source code, you’re out of luck.  Only developers with access to the source code can do it.</p>

            <p>yeah, why even use the mod folders if you can just overwrite the base game… genius.<br>
btw, to make it really work you have to port the code.</p>
