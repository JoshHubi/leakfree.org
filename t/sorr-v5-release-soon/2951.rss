New and last update about the game progress in this blog (there will be further small updates on the forum but not here). The next update in the blog will be to announce the confirmed release date for the game and then the download link the next week. The game content is detailed below; I hope you understand we are taking the necessary time so everything is perfect for the launch, taking into account the free time that each one of us can manage to put into the game.

GAME CONTENT

GAME ENGINE

    * Version 5.0
    * 70% of the code has been reprogrammed since the last version
    * New engines for physics, collision, interaction, scroll et al.
    * New AI (important)

112 STAGES
All of the stages have been slightly remastered, with bigger resolution, new effects and new layers.

    * 8 stages from SOR
    * 26 stages from SOR2
    * 37 stages from SOR3
    * 41 original stages (approximately, there could be less since some stages from v4 won’t make it in)

18 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS

    * More than 1500 custom sprites created for the Remake (250 per set)
    * All of the characters from the saga
    * All of the SOR versions remastered
    * All of the special moves from SOR3 available for all of the characters versions
    * New moves for all of the characters

64 ENEMIES

    * All of the SOR enemies remastered
    * All of the SOR2 enemies with their full movesets
    * All of the SOR3 / BKIII enemies with their full movesets, including both censored/uncensored versions except for Break
    * Selected enemies from the SMS / GG versions
    * New enemies (Truckman, Slash, Rudra et al.)

16 SPECIAL ENEMIES

    * Bulldozer et al.
    * New special enemies

66 REMIXES

    * Remixes from most of the saga soundtrack. Many of the ones in v4 have been replaced with new ones. There are still some remixes to come so the number could go up.

MISC CONTENT

    * High degree of customization through options for the combat system and other variables
    * 10 game modes
    * 34 unlockable features, including editors, artworks, cheats et al.
    * Sormaker 1.0 (tools included)
    * Online play (some features still undetermined)

EXPECTED DOWNLOAD SIZE:
About 175 MB compressed (depends on the final number of remixes).

            <p>I just never saw the appeal in mindless beat em’ ups. I played TMNT Arcade, it was boring as shit… and everything else in the genre looks exactly like that game.</p>
