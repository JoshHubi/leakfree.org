    <title>Is Portal 3 a possibility?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/is-portal-3-a-possibility/13272</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just been thinking about what Valve has in in store for the future, and with Left for Dead 3 and Half-Life 3 (or episode 3) in the works, does anyone think that Portal 3 may be a possibility? And if so, what do you think the plot should be like or might be like? (Sorry if the title was a bit misleading, I couldn&#39;t think of a better one)</description>

            <p>If Valve can continue to do new and interesting things with the portal mechanics, I think there’s still a lot that can be done even as a sequel. I mean it’s hundreds of years in the future, and while post apocalyptic settings are getting kinda stale, I think it would be pretty interesting to explore derelict cities with the portal gun. It could be way more free and open than the last 2 games. It doesn’t even have to be with Chell, it could be another few centuries down the line, and by that time Chell became a mythical figure with a magical talisman, and someone who grows up hearing the myths finds it and wields it in a new story. I dunno what the story would be but I think the concept would be cool to play.</p>

            <p>I think the only place left to go would be a prequel. I think Portal 2 ended just fine, although I REALLY would like another one. I still want to know what F-STOP was, because iIrc Gaben said the F-STOP concept was worth the whole creative experiment Valve did. Maybe just make a prequel that is from soon after Bring Your Daughter to work day, and you’re an employee trying to escape. After that, make F-STOP and maybe make that a new series in its own right.</p>

            <p>They could always just do what they originally planned to do with Portal 2 and make a prequel that occurs in the earlier days of Aperture Science, likely using that new mechanic they were wanting to use.<br>
Sure, it wouldn’t have Chell, or even GlaDos, but I’m pretty sure we all know that the real star of the Portal series is Aperture Science itself.<br>
(Also, more Cave Johnson, because we all need more Cave Johnson)</p>

<p>In all seriousness, co-op DLC is the best choice, although I’m not sure how much more Valve can do with the story.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t consider it “milking the IP” if it’s making good progress and advancement with the series, and going a good direction. bscly if it’s consistently good, which is something Valve seems to be good at.</p>

            <p>It’s still possible to have a series of games in the Portal subuniverse, with or without Chell. Chell could find a band of human/nonhuman rebels and return to the facility.  GLaDOS mentions in the final song that she’s counting on Chell just wanting freedom and wanting her gone (hoping she’ll make some new disaster elsewhere).  I don’t think she’s expecting Chell to return, which would make the perfect opportunity for a surprise attack (assuming GLaDOS turns off the sensors that detect humans or whatever).</p>
<p>There’s still things that can be done in the Portal subuniverse.  HL2: Ep3 would probably satisfy that, though.</p>

            <p>I agree, no more portal. I wouldn’t say no to more puzzle games from Valve tho.</p>

            <p>No, the Portal 2 ending was perfect. Let the series end on a high note and move to other pastures.</p>

            <p>Only with a completely different story. No Chell or Glados. Because the same thing for the third time would be an obvious milking of IP and lack of creativity.</p>

            <p>Not if you plan on Chell being involved. I think leaving GLaDOS as an insane AI constantly testing new ideas until her circuits finally deteriorate with Chell going out and…doing something. I don’t know if the Combine thing is over by then, or what…but I don’t see much potential left in the story unless we end up seeing Chell in HL3.</p>
<p>Which is a total possibility, maybe she’s found refuge with Adrian Shepard. I’d ship that.</p>

            <p>Where the fuck is there left to go in Portal? Chell’s out of the facility, she got what she wanted. GlaDOS is content to run her little Aperture kingdom without outside influence. I don’t really see where the story can go.</p>

            <p>I’ve just been thinking about what Valve has in in store for the future, and with Left for Dead 3 and Half-Life 3 (or episode 3) in the works, does anyone think that Portal 3 may be a possibility? And if so, what do you think the plot should be like or might be like? (Sorry if the title was a bit misleading, I couldn’t think of a better one)</p>
