    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/valve-vs-blizzard/8634</link>
    <description>Fully aware this is my second thread, and my second thread with &quot;vs&quot; in the title. However this time it is warranted. I&#39;ve been reading up on the whole DOTA2 trademarking hostilities and I gotta admit I&#39;m leaning more towards Blizzard being in the right. I mean if Blizzard came along and for instance (for example purposes) tried to trademark counterstrike, I could see valve getting just as pissed off. I see it as a bit of a dickhead move, which is a shame because I love valve. Just wondering others thoughts.</description>

            <p>I just wish Blizzard hadn’t such a tight and greedy grip on the digital versions of their games and allowed them to be sold on other sites.</p>
<p>Their old games are still shockingly expensive.</p>

<p>Oh, hey, lets look at Natural selection. The first one was made for the GoldSrc engine.</p>
<p>Then came NS2, a commercial product, but it isn’t going to be made for the Source engine (Which Valve licensed to them). Its gonna be made by a custom made engine. And guess what? Valve isn’t going against the team, saying that it’s their property just because it was a mod made on the GoldSrc engine.</p>
<p>Valve is one big greedy Corporate bastard.</p>

<p>If DotA isn’t a trademark (and it’s not) Blizzard cannot do anything because its owner is the mod’s creator, who is working for ValvE. Therefore, ValvE can easily buy the mod and make it a trademark wheras Blizzard would have to convince the owner of DotA to sell it to them (which he would not.)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That is not true. There’s a strong legal argument to be made that Dota is a derivative work of Warcraft 3, in which case Blizzard would have rights to the name. It used a lot of their assets.</p>
<p>Blizzard can also make the case that the term had previous association with their product in the minds of consumers.</p>
<p>There’s a misconception here that you have to file for a trademark in order to own it. You don’t. If you’re using something as a trademark, it’s yours, you just strengthen your hold on it if you actually register it.</p>
<p>Since this is a mod that includes so many parties, there’s really no way of telling which way the judge is going to rule, but my money is that it will be in Blizzard’s favor.</p>

Therefore, ValvE can easily buy the mod and make it a trademark wheras Blizzard would have to convince the owner of DotA to sell it to them (which he would not.) I don’t see how ValvE is being greedy, they simply buy the trademarks and usually employ the creators of the mods. While many other companies employ mostly anyone just to get bigger, ValvE’s recruitment is very different. They only employ people who made a name for themselves (like Notch, who they tried to employ) or people who created popular mods.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t think Valve steals the rights and games.  The original modifier is usually involved (eg. IceFrog) and sees some reward.  Without Valve’s backing, those games wouldn’t have amounted to anything.  They’re known for working with the mod community.  Personally, I’d feel pretty honoured if Valve wanted to turn a mod I made into a legit game.</p>
<p>Really, Blizzard has already made a shit ton of money out of DotA; the game boosted Warcraft 3 sales heaps.  Most people I know bought WC3 purely for DotA and didn’t even touch a melee game, or at least didn’t get into melee games until well after.</p>

<p>-It began as a custom map made by Eul (now works at Valve)</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s really all I’d need to hand it to Valve. The rights to the map/mod were never bought by or sold to Blizzard. The original creator is now one of Valve’s employees. If anyone holds the rights, it’s him, and he obviously doesn’t mind giving the reins over to Valve.</p>

            <p>I really couldn’t care less about these games either for some reason. My friend keeps bitching at me to play LoL but I have no desire to. I just don’t see the appeal personally.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I could never get into little games like this, either. It’s a shame, too, because the concept always sounds quite attractive to me, but the product never delivers.</p>

            <p>There’s something vaguely admirable about Valve having balls brassy enough to call this what it actually is, rather than slapping a different name on what’s obviously a Dota clone.</p>
<p>That said, I really don’t give a crap who wins this court battle. I have no interest in these kinds of games, and would have preferred if Valve had made another new IP instead. As far as I’m concerned, the upcoming games/mods should be called <span class="bbcode-i">Shit on a Sandwich: Starcraft II Edition</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">Shit on a Sandwich: Valve Edition</span>.</p>

            <p>Ahem. Blizzard does not own any mod on their engine, nor does any other company own mods from theirs. They do have power over those mods but that’s as far as it gets. They can freely take the mods and use them in their games but cannot own a mod made by someone else. Also, DOTA wasn’t a trademark and therefore all Blizzard can do is nothing.</p>

            <p>I thought Valve’s version was called Destruction of the Artifact?<br>
Because team’s work together to try to destroy the enemy Artifact(while defending their own).</p>
