    <title>Many props are completely black</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/many-props-are-completely-black/15313</link>
    <description>A lot of props (mostly pipes, crates and other static stuff) are rendered with a pitch black texture since the december update, although they are sometimes quite shiny. See screenshots.

The screenshots are with default graphics settings, but I tried lots of different settings without effecting the problem much.

Screenshots uploaded to imgur: [url]https://imgur.com/a/4UIC1[/url]

(because I got &quot;An unknown error occurred during the upload.&quot; while uploading here)

Hardware: Geforce GTX 1050 Ti

Edit2: Rendering works fine on Win 10 on same hardware, so it&#39;s a Linux specific problem.</description>
