    <title>Crash, start of office complex</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-start-of-office-complex/9636</link>
    <description>I get off the elevator.  The scientist in the ceiling is pulled up. I look up in to the hole in the ceiling, turn on my flash light, and crash.

Happened again after I relaunched the game and repeated the steps.

EDIT: On a 3rd attempt, I found that if I waited 5 seconds, the frame rate stuttered, smoothed out, and then it worked fine. Perhaps related to the electrical effects down the hall?

EDIT: the sode and snack machines in the locked room to the right (where the scientist is barnacle-ed up in to the ceiling) can not be broken into.

EDIT: Same with another snack machine close to the exit of this level (normal route, not alternate - tiny hallway with red doors on both ends)</description>

            <p>On a second run through the game Iâ€™m finding that turning on my flashlight will crash me in a lot of places on this level. At the start as mentioned above, looking at the ceiling back where the 2 scientists were hiding, and just now  crashed turning it on in the duct work off of the electrified flooded office.</p>
