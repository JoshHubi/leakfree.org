            <p>Right - the idea and the website itself aren’t funny, but that he remembered this and dug it out to post in this thread was (at least to me). He’s comparing OPs fluoride phobia with the DHMO hoax - and that’s spot-on. It was a good use of the website. When he posted it, I was like “ahahahaha - right, that’s exactly what’s happening here. Good catch.”</p>

            <p>This isn’t a study, it’s an opinion piece on a special interest site opposing fluoridation.</p>
<p>It’s not well-written and the argumentation is really very bad. It’s basically a bunch of word salad. It doesn’t make any sort of case, even rhetorically, that fluoridated water causes Alzheimer’s Disease.</p>
<p>You should  follow the links to the National Cancer Institute and the CDC for information regarding the effects of fluoride on health, rather than just random articles by interested parties. There are plenty of good sources for information regarding most subjects on the internet, but probably more that aren’t good sources. Articles like this are not good sources.</p>
<p>Now, go brush your teeth, and use a toothpaste with fluoride - I promise it won’t give you AIDS.</p>

            <p>Here are some interesting facts about fluoridated water:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/fluoridated-water" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/fluoridated-water</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/</a></p>
<p>Also, fluoride is not added to water in continental Europe, but to salt. The dramatic rise is life expectancy in Western countries in the 20th century is largely attributed to advancements in dental health, as common dental infections weaken the heart over a period of years resulting in a shortened life span due to heart disease.</p>

            <p>I’ve seen other videos just like that on TV and you can tell they’re fake, also the fluoridated water conspiracy is dumb but who knows fluoridated water could cause caner Calgary Alberta has banned it and now they’re trying to ban it across Canada. Also I hate Alex Jones his site is like a cult for nutcases.</p>

<p>Right - I think that a lot of people, at least in the US, grow up with some assumptions that they learn from their parents, teachers, coaches, church, and local community in general, and at some point in their development, discover that most of this stuff isn’t true or correct.  I think that’s the case for most of us, and we work this out in our teens or twenties, maybe when we leave home for college or move away from the farm or small town, etc.</p>
<p>But the problem for some people is that there are plenty of interested parties who are more than happy to explain “The Truth” to them - like Alex Jones, Glenn Beck, or any one of hundreds of people who make their living writing books, lecturing, hosting radio shows selling conspiracy theories of all sorts - political, economic, historical, religious, scientific, etc.</p>

            <p>I once dropped acid with a guy who believed in the Illuminati and all that bullshit and wouldn’t shut the fuck up about how they control everything and perform ritual sacrifices to the devil and spread chem trails and the music industry is a puppet and etc.  Completely and utterly ruined my trip with his nonsense.</p>
<p>Relegate that shit to fiction.  It works in Assassin’s Creed.  Not in real life.  It just amounts to arrogant people who think they’re the only ones who aren’t brainwashed looking for interesting conspiracy in a world where, in most cases, and apple is and apple.  They are bored with accepting the status quo so they weave fiction into reality.  Again, awesome to do in movies or video games.  It’s interesting to think about.  But in most cases it isn’t real.</p>
<p>Are there things we aren’t told?  Yes.  Is information sometimes skewed to sell a product?  Yes.  Does the person with the most money (ie. big business) run the government?  For the most part, yes.  But is there some grand tinfoil hat conspiracy in control of the world that places all of their symbols right where the public can see them?  No.  And if there is some grand secret society conspiracy in the works, you will never know about it.  That’s sort of the point of a secret society.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, this video was posted by a conspiracy theorist.  His other clips are 9/11 and 7/7 conspiracy clips, and , interestingly, an old chestnut, the fluroridated water conspiracy, which originated from the John Birch Society as paranoid anti-communist propaganda in the 50s.</p>
<p>… and some Illuminati and Freemason clips, too.</p>
