            <p>About Hellsing:<br>
The tv series had a retarded storyline (wtf was up with the stupid grey guy?) but better animation and less gore. The OVA had a better storyline in some ways but the gore and brutality was excessive. And the evil nazis plot was so insanely cliche it made me want to puke.<br>
Overall both are watchable, but not amazing.</p>

<p>As I said, I haven’t read very much of the manga, Hellsing isn’t really my cup of tea, but ignoring plot points and totally making stuff up I don’t find very good. Besides, you complained about the OVA having too much gore, which, of course it’s going to have if the manga does.</p>

<p>Haters gonna hate. Yes there is a very very very large portion of anime very strongly lacking storyline interest or something similar, but that is not true of all anime. Code Geass has an amazing storyline. Death Note has the most clever detective work of anything I’ve seen, anime or live action.</p>
<p>you really have to hunt for anime that fits your interests. And a lot of anime is utter shit. But there is also a lot of good stuff, and the good stuff is definitely worth it.</p>

<p>So basically, you’re saying it was anime.</p>

<p>My friend suggested I watch Kissxsis so I tried it and that shit was perverted. XD</p>

<p>I really see little different in style, most of the difference is in how much realism was incorporated, but pretty much any abstraction is merely moving towards the bottom or upper-middle left, or upper-left in extremely unique cases.  You really just don’t see the wild amount of variation in personal style that you get in the rest of the world.  The bottom-left and upper-right border pretty much the entirety of the significant variation you’ll see.</p>

            <p>Well said, mattemuse. It’s just like any other form of media. I mean, how many movies come out every year, how many of them sound like you’d like to see them, and out of the ones you see, how many are good? Anime’s the same way, and if anything, worse about it because the majority of it is aimed at kids and teens.</p>

            <p>for each one of those styles there are probably a billion derivatives that look exactly like them, plus a billion white kids who are badly copying any one particular style on deviantart. originality is the exception rather than the rule, although admittedly that applies to everything and not just anime.</p>
<p>especially the bottom-left example. there is not a more idiotically cliche’d style of drawing than whatever that is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I see nothing here that isn’t somewhere between realism and the never-changing “anime” look.  Except that thing with the cats, I don’t know what’s going on there.</p>
<p>Myazaki is still unique enough in his writing and GARGANTUAN BUDGET to be forgiven.  I like his stuff.</p>

            <p>I do not watch anime and I have not seen a lot of anime, but Ive watched most if not all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyver:_The_Bioboosted_Armor" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Guyver</a> series however (at least everything i could find, I believe there are 26 episodes) and it was badass.</p>
<p>They also made a shitty live action film based of the anime series starring Mark Hamill.  I never saw it though.</p>
