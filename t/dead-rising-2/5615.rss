    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/dead-rising-2/5615</link>
    <description>Buy this game. Seriously. The PC version is almost perfect. Really tight mouse and keyboard controls, and the engine is really optimized. Runs really well maxed out and with tons of zombies on-screen.

The PC version is also cheaper and has better graphics.

I really, really recommend this game.</description>

<p>Jeez guys, you can’t change someone’s opinion, especially if they have in fact tried the game. I understand there are plenty of things not to like about the game; I will say that it gets more fun as you level up, though I realize that’s not the best consolation.</p>

            <p>Hubicorn has spoken.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/dblkion">@dblkion</a> - You have a very jaded view and opinion of what a console fag definition is, i own a console and i like console games, some games just feel more right on console, but id never sway my decision and start being a TWAT about it, hence you, by the way get a face, and your not going down the right road to earn respect if you didn’t already know, until youve earnt respect the next forum member after the others are going to treat you like shit.</p>
<p>You just as bad as the halo franchise kid’s believing it to be the god of all things.</p>

            <p>Hubicorn is very picky with games.<br>
Hubicorn gets bored with games fast.<br>
Hubicorn has played the first part, meh…<br>
Hubicorn dislikes the shadow graphics in this one in PC and PS3 versions but got quickly over it.<br>
Hubicorn loves this one, period.<br>
Hubicorn demands you waste your money on this and play with him.<br>
JUST DO IT!</p>

            <p>@ dblkion… Ehh… most of the ppl who play this game have played the first one… you wouldn’t be bitching so much about had you played the first one too. Previews of the game said it was going to be just like the first one. I on the other hand think this game is great, and this is no mediocre game.</p>

            <p>I actually use it as demo, if devs are too lazy to give us propers demos why not try the game without paying it before you waste your money ?<br>
I pay for games I believe good, and for those that I have doubts, I try them before, I don’t think this is being a pirate  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>To get back on the subject :<br>
This is a really awfull game ! But there are always apple-like  fan boys proud of wasting their money and trying to make people think the product is worth it :retard:</p>
<p>This game is worth a 8/20 for a 2010 pc game, Probably a 14/20 for console fags tho, they love meaningless game.<br>
And shit magazines of pc games reviews or websites give even more, around 16/20 because if they don’t give those games good reviews the game editor will never let them have their hand on other games.<br>
I remember reading a PC GAMER who gave 18/20 for The Matrix : Path Of Neo, I bought it and played it, and holy crap it was one of the worst games I had ever played…</p>
<p>But in the end, if you REALLY think this game is good, that means you are very tolerent to game mediocrity. I’m not  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Actually it’s done by the original studio and helped with by Blue Castle games here in Vancouver.</p>

            <p>I didnt even know it was coming out on pc, maybe i will check it out O_o But honestly looks like a ripoff of the first game done by another studio, same as with bioshock 2, so i expect the same average quality ;/</p>

            <p>I normally would have waited till later to buy this, but I figure then it would be difficult to find a co-op friend. It’s pretty fun, and there are actually a LOT more combo weapons than I anticipated.<br>
There ARE some disadvantages to the PC version: You CANNOT map controls (officially. There is a gamedata edit you can make to change controls, but it doesn’t affect what it tells you to do visually), some people have had trouble running the game (not me), and it uses GFWL (I don’t mind; but it does make networking easier for them)</p>

            <p>Good game, the beginning is a struggle to survive but when you begin leveling up you turn into the zombie apocalypse equivalent of Hitler. Personally I like both of those parts.</p>
