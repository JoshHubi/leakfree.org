    <title>A question about G-man</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-question-about-g-man/5860</link>
    <description>I was reading [url=&#39;https://members.shaw.ca/halflifestory/timeline.htm&#39;]this[/url] and seen this
[quote]
GMan[...]triggers a resonance cascade within the Anomalous Materials sector of the Black Mesa complex, by bringing in a specific test sample to be used.
[/quote]
I am relatively new to the HL series but I&#39;ve finished them all and I don&#39;t remember learning in any game that Gman brough the test sample. Maybe I&#39;ve missed something?</description>

<p>Why the hell do you guys care? JUST IGNORE THE DAMN DIFFERENCE. It is ONE letter off. The name can be spelled either way. GordAn or GordOn. There is not much of a difference. When some people pronounce it, it sounds like an A, not an O. Othertimes, it sounds like a O, and not a A.</p>
<p>So is it so hard to not give a crap <span class="bbcode-i">for fuck sake</span>???</p>
<p>Or ignore the fact that it <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t make sense</span>???</p>
<p>I mean, is it REALLY worth arguing about? You guys jump on EVERY little spelling error. You did it to my brother (granted it WAS planned). Some of the things you guys type looks like crap! It sometimes can’t even be understood. But I am sure that you didn’t notice, or didn’t want to change it afterwards. Hell, I am sure that this post may  have a few errors in it.</p>
<p>As soon as I hit Submit reply,<span class="bbcode-b"> I will be watching and waiting for SOMEONE to get all offened and start to shoot off at the keyboard. Then I will just sit back and laugh as you take it too far</span>.</p>

<p>I can understand that spelling a name wrong bugs you. People spell my last name wrong all the time. Hell, people spell my first name wrong all the time too! But the difference is that I don’t get all offended about it. If it a important thing, then I go back and correct them. If they did it on purpose, then I go to a higher authority and change it myself.</p>
<p>Not to be cruel or anything (don’t take offense mechaelite) but it looks like he is from a non-english speaking community, which would explain his spelling mistakes. Maybe his language spells it as Gordan, and he tries to spell it like the game, which is Gordon. He said it was early when he did the post, so it is entirely possible that he forgot.</p>
<p>But anyways, lets all get back on topic. Unfortunately, I have already said my piece on this topic, so I have no more to say.</p>

<p>So what you are saying is that I am wrong, should go shut up, and have no creditability in my argument? I am sorry, but lol is a commonly used term for laughter, rather than haha, which to me, sounds sarcastic and rude. The time of a post does make a difference. Would you have the patience to go back through things you type at 1 in the morning? I for one, would not. I would instead edit it in the morning, or that evening. Granted, that is what should have been done, but we have no idea what happened the next day.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you are right. Some people from other countries that don’t have English as their primary language DO do better, but others don’t. Especially if you live in a house with people that do not allow English and/or prefer their own language. Or your in a rural area with “old” customs, like me. The difference is that I live in an English speaking country, so my English is accurate, with only a few, careless mistakes here and there.</p>
<p>Yes, he should have double checked his work. Yes he should be more accurate with English. All that may be, but we all make mistakes. I just made one with adding lol to my post. You have probably made one before (like many people have). He misspelled Gordan Freeman’s name.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was reading your part on how his spelling of Gordan in his country was “immaterial” and remembered something. Games that are sold in other countries CAN use different languages. My uncle has a L4D game from Russia, and it is in Russian. I am not entirely sure if the names are spelled differently though. They are pronounced differently, that I am sure of.</p>

<p>I’m from Spain, so that’s correct, and it’s also called Gordon here but I preffear more Gordan. Of course I can write it well when I want, but when you just don’t care about how the god damn name is wrote or you haven’t got enough time to revise it, It’s normal to do this errors.</p>

<p>It’s immaterial how he spells Gordon in ‘his language’. It’s the spelling used in the game and that’s the only correct spelling in this instance. My name is Derek and I know there are variations in several countries but DEREK is the only correct way to spell MY name. Oh, and as for it being late/early when he posted? Even greater reason for double-checking his post before submitting.</p>

            <p>I can understand that spelling a name wrong bugs you. People spell my last name wrong all the time. Hell, people spell my first name wrong all the time too! But the difference is that I don’t get all offended about it. If it a important thing, then I go back and correct them. If they did it on purpose, then I go to a higher authority and change it myself.</p>

            <p>Why the hell do you guys care? JUST IGNORE THE DAMN DIFFERENCE. It is ONE letter off. The name can be spelled either way. GordAn or GordOn. There is not much of a difference. When some people pronounce it, it sounds like an A, not an O. Othertimes, it sounds like a O, and not a A.</p>
<p>So is it so hard to not give a crap <span class="bbcode-i">for fuck sake</span>???</p>
<p>Or ignore the fact that it <span class="bbcode-i">doesn’t make sense</span>???</p>
<p>I mean, is it REALLY worth arguing about? You guys jump on EVERY little spelling error. You did it to my brother (granted it WAS planned). Some of the things you guys type looks like crap! It sometimes can’t even be understood. But I am sure that you didn’t notice, or didn’t want to change it afterwards. Hell, I am sure that this post may  have a few errors in it.</p>
<p>As soon as I hit Submit reply, I will be watching and waiting for SOMEONE to get all offened and start to shoot off at the keyboard. Then I will just sit back and laugh as you take it too far.</p>

<p>How do you know it? Maybe he isn’t neither good or bad, just neutral, following orders. But I wouldn’t doubt that he would let <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">gordan</span></span> die when he becomes useless to him, Just like darth vader and the emperor from star wars: Gordon is his right hand but if he finds some1 more powerful, he will use him instead of <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">gordan</span></span></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
