    <description>Did anyone see the demo for this game? I haven&#39;t seen it entirely but from the few snippets I did see it looks amazing. You&#39;re an assassin who has access to all electronics and information and can use them how you like. In the demo, your target is going through a green light, the assassin changes the lights and the target gets tboned and it causes a pileup where you go in firing trying to take him out. It also seems to have a co-op function.</description>

            <p>Or all the smaller stories in the newspapers in Hitman Blood Money. I love games where there are little things going on in the background while you play. And it looks fantastic.</p>
<p>Edit: I see a lot of people are saying it’s a doctored screenshot or one that’s taken with such high quality that it would be unplayable, like with AC apparently.</p>

<p>You obviously know more than I do.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I was under the impression that it had a quad core processor that was being underutilized by today’s standards, and that the games not specifically designed for it were not optimized for the platform resulting in poor performance.</p>
<p>Most of that’s heresay, and speculation. I have absolutely no idea what the PS3 is capable of. I also don’t own one, so I’m not particularily privy to the console’s specs.</p>

            <p>The devs have said they are staggering release, releasing on current gen consoles and taking their time. Looks like it will be a PC title first then dumbed down for Xbox 360, PS3 and WiiU later on which is great for PC gamers.</p>
<p>To be honest it looks like it could be stripped out for current gen. They did a similar thing for Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3 and had it running at 30fps.</p>
<p>Remove tesselation, lower draw distance, lower texture detail and change the level of dynamic lighting and it will fit this console gen. Due to NDA’s I would be very surprised if this is a game set for release on next gen, if it were it wouldn’t have been announced in my opinion.</p>

            <p>Maybe Watch Dogs isn’t coming out this year and the PS4 will be out by then?</p>
<p>The interview that Angry Joe did with the designer allayed some of my fears of the game being overly scripted. It made me a little more excited for the game.</p>

<p>I’m curious as to how they would handle individual character AI so they don’t all end up being repetitive.</p>
<p>If they could make a system where AI could dynamically interact with one another (kinda like oblivion/skyrim but way better) and talk using thousands of pre-made conversations, it could make for a much more “real” feeling environment.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Pfft. The AI should be generating it’s own conversations by now. . .</p>
<p>Who needs scripted voice actors?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I’d like to see the AI in video games to be provided with an encyclopedia of prerecorded words and/or phrases, implementing them in real-time based on situation. Thus applying the appropriate inflection in association with neighboring words and phrases needed to fit within a particular conversation or outburst.</p>
<p>I don’t see that happening anytime soon, but an enduser’s experience in a particular environment could be improved when the AI reacts dynamically, especially when the player is communicating with them through voice input in technology that is similar to what Kinect provides.</p>
<p>Rather than recognize a “hey you!” there could be a multitude of different ways to approach a particular scenario. Imagine having an actual conversation with an NPC that isn’t restricted by a singular linear dialog tree.</p>

            <p>Pretty much once the “next” gen hardware is out, it ceases to be next gen and is simply current gen. So technically next-gen consoles could never exist as released products, except as some false, cheesy metaphor for marketing purposes.</p>

            <p>I understand that you’re saying it’s not next gen because it’s not a gen yet, but it also completely negates the entire definition of “<span class="bbcode-u">NEXT</span> Gen”.</p>
<p>Your qualifier for it being Next Gen requires a paradox.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A massive step forward from many developers producing many games at the same time so it’s more of a generation and not just a single thing, the release of new consoles to accommodate these games, etc.</p>
<p>If it sets a trend and other developers follow it, then I shall stand corrected.</p>

<p>So basically, you have no fucking idea.</p>

<p>Dominic Guay: Obviously, you saw one specific example during the  demo. You saw how we hacked into a conversation to find out that someone  was coming. But another example… you might have noticed that one person  was guilty of plagiarism. So maybe you can follow that person home,  hack into his personal laptop, and actually find out that he’s doing it  again, and blackmail him for money.<br>
Another example is maybe you can find a guy’s bank account number. So  maybe you decide you want to start slowly stealing from that bank  account. With so much information available on computers now, we’re  trying to support as many types of both honorable and dishonorable uses  of information as you want.</p>
