    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/watch-dogs/12132</link>
    <description>I accidentally discovered this game, &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;, after reading through Ubisoft Montreal&#39;s page on Wikipedia. [by the way, what&#39;s up with Canadian developers? Bioware, Ubisoft Montreal, Eidos Montreal... starting to appreciate them all]

I took a look at the teaser trailer
[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGhkdWmrx14[/url]

and the gameplay trailer
[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA[/url]

I find it rather... interesting indeed. But can&#39;t come up with my mind. Yet.
Anyone of you knew this? Opinions?</description>

            <p>I restarted my save file and started playing again. Considering how much the game made me angry, I really don’t know why. The alleged new patch to help fight the hitching issue managed to make the problem worse for me and I can’t reduce texture detail because the game locks it to Ultra.</p>

            <p>I skipped most of the side content. I did some of the gang hideouts and a few investigations here and there, as well as plenty of crime prevention. I should probably go back and wrap up the trafficking plot at some point, though. (Of course, I hear the resolution doesn’t really do the idea justice…)</p>

            <p>I get mid to high 20s on my R9 290 running at medium/low, high teens at ultra, both at 2560x1440. Anyone got some performance boosting tips? Looking up some benchmarks for my card, and expecting that none of my other hardware is bottlenecking and don’t see why it would, I should be getting 40s-50s.</p>

            <p>FINALLY finished the game…some thoughts:<br>
STORY:utterly predictable from the very beginning…as a matter of fact at one point I was expecting …not…BEGGING them to pull the old cheese “I bet you didn’t see that coming ha” twist that I hate so much just so the actual plot would get somehow interesting but NOPE…also…writing and dialogues are REALLY atrocious at times.<br>
GAMEPLAY:The hacking gimmick is pretty neat and at least to me it actually didn’t get old that fast…for some reason “press button for awesome” is something I just can’t get enough of.What I didn’t lik though is that so many things were contextual(takedowns,climbing,crouching… …)<br>
GRAPHICS:The fact that Ubisoft hid some of the gfx effects is just…UBISOFT.The game actually ran and looked pretty solid(once you tweak it to the hell and back).<br>
MUSIC:The part that seriously disappointed me…there were some interesting musical cues here and there like the fixer contracts theme,but everything else was just really bland.<br>
I give this game an Assassin’s Creed /10 and hope that the sequel (just like for that game)will improve pretty much on everything(I said “pretty much” cause you can’t have EVERYTHING better…that’s just silly).<br>
P.S. No Person of Interest easter eggs…<br>
WHY…JUST…WHY…</p>

            <p>Well, it makes sense they removed it if it’s buggy. Valve released Half-Life in a good state, it was one of the best looking games of its time, even if they removed a few things here and there, it still looked amazing.</p>
<p>Ubisoft doesn’t have any proper excuse for removing so much stuff. It’s not more buggy than the actual game, and its much much more than Valve removed from Half-Life. Besides, Valve didn’t really say “We didn’t remove anything” after the release of Half-Life, one of the devs of Ubisoft tweeted that regarding Watch Dogs.</p>

            <p>They were only available for D3D and have been patched out since the WON-Steam switch (I believe), but I do remember at least the shadow command in all it’s extremely buggy glory.</p>
<p>Edit, found it. It’s not a direct command, just a call you need to enable in a dll:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>You can still use shadows in HL1, just add this code to StudioModelRender.cpp in the client DLL.</p>
<p>Add after CStudioModelRenderer::Init</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>void (*GL_StudioDrawShadow)(void);</p>
<p>__declspec(naked) void ShadowHack(void)<br>
{<br>
_asm<br>
{<br>
push ecx;<br>
jmp [GL_StudioDrawShadow];<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>Then replace IEngineStudio.GL_StudioDrawShadow(); in CStudioModelRenderer::StudioRenderFinal_Hardware with</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>GL_StudioDrawShadow = (void(*)(void))(((unsigned int)IEngineStudio.GL_StudioDrawShadow)+32);</p>
<p>if (IEngineStudio.GetCurrentEntity() != gEngfuncs.GetViewModel())<br>
ShadowHack();</p>

<p>water that looked a lot better and a primitive form of dynamic shadows, but neither could be found in the actual game, but were still accessible through hidden config commands.</p>

<p>What were those commands, if you happen to know? Various Google searches didn’t help.</p>

<p>Way too many people think that Watch Dogs was way too overhyped, and that they have a moral obligation to knock it down a few pegs, so they take every opportunity to attack the game, instead of having some fun playing it, or moving on and playing something else worth their time.</p>

<p>Yeah it’s totally because people hate the game and not that Ubisoft is yet again being retarded and gimping the PC version. See also: Far Cry 4.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft’s reaction to the E3 shaders hack was rather silly though. Ubisoft PR has gotten really good at saying a ton of words that mean very little.</p>

            <p>The HL1 downgrade wasn’t as obvious as Watch_Dogs’ neither was it as hyped.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what exactly the big deal is here?</p>
<p>I still have he original HL packaging (the huge orange box) and it shows screenshots with water that looked a lot better and a primitive form of dynamic shadows, but neither could be found in the actual game, but were still accessible through hidden config commands.</p>
<p>What’s the difference with that and Watch Dogs now?</p>
<p>Mind you: I don’t care about Watch Dogs, it strikes me as a very dull and stale game.</p>

            <p>Well it just seems like a lot of amazing modelling, texture work and coding went to waste because even after enabling all the right config entries, in some places textures and effects are too down-scaled even on Ultra and objects like those hanging lights at the entrance to the club that previously had an amazing level of detail are now flat as a brick.</p>
