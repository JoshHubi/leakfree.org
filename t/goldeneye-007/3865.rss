    <title>GoldenEye 007</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/goldeneye-007/3865</link>
    <description>Ahhh a true classic.  I think anyone who had a N64 has played it and has fond memories of it.   I still remember the first TV commercial I saw and the daze it put me in.

I was just reminiscing the other day about the good times my friends and I had with it, not to mention the countless times I&#39;ve played the dam and facility levels.  Aside from hilarious multiplayer, we would activate &quot;007 mode&quot; and modify the game characteristics.  For instance, we would decrease enemy health to 1%, but nearly max out their damage, reaction time, and accuracy...basically putting the AI on an equal level with us.  We were only able to beat like handful of the first levels lol, great challenge tho.

So, what are your most memorable and fun moments with GoldenEye64?

O BTW, 1.2 solitaire rules! lol</description>

            <p>I was about 10 when it came out. I loved it.  I loved Perfect Dark.  I would say I put more hours into Perfect Dark because of the insane amount of time it takes to get everything 100% and because of the awesome multiplayer component.  But I still pull out Goldeneye every once in a while and have a good ol’ match with my friends.  And it’s still more fun than most any other multiplayer game I’ve ever played.</p>

            <p>The only people who will agree with me were probably kids when it was released, like me.  I was 12 when Goldeneye was released and played it for years.  Perfect Dark was better, but I didn’t put as many hours into it as GoldenEye.  Turok2 is another favorite of mine as well.  Those are definitely the top 3 FPS for N64.</p>
<p>Its probably been at least 7 or 8 years since I really played any of them.</p>
