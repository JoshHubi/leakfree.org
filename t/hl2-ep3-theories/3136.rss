    <description>From the concept art and the story clues, my guess is that, instead of destroying the Borealis, Alyx will use the Combine Portal code in junction with Aperture&#39;s tech to send Gordon to the Advisor Homeworld for a surprise  :wink:</description>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by “string”?</p>
<p>I never thought of it that way. I always figured he was talking about  putting him into Half Life 2, to fight the combine. What implies  otherwise?</p>
<p>Also, I don’t really agree with the idea that putting Dr. Freeman in  stasis for 20 years and then taking him out counts as “time travel.”  That would imply that putting somebody in stasis and then driving them  across the world and waking them up counts as “teleportation.”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>@ Restless:</p>
<p>By string I was referring to a parallel universe, sorry. As all non-physicists I tend to use the vocabulary carelessly.</p>
<p>Why  should the G-man teleport Gordon into City 17 (directly out of stasis  or whatever), knowing he will cause the usual helpful trouble, and then  say he put him in the wrong place (unless he assumes the point of view  of the combine for whatever reason or knows he will fail).</p>
<p>The only “wrong” place, a  place where a terrible (terrible from the pov of the PC) thing happened  at, was the cascade at Black Mesa. And G-mans orchestration of this  event DID include Gordon Freeman. He could have easily taken Gina or  Colette, both having functioning Hazard Suits given the influence he  has.</p>
<p>Gordon was the right man, in the right place, for Gordon a  seemingly wrong place of course. The G-man thus plays with the proverb   “The right man in the right place”. Thus I think he really meant the  resonance cascade. And due to the fact that the G-Man labels Gordon the  “right” man, almost KNOWING he will not fail, in any case putting a  GREAT deal of faith into him, I think the G-Man knows things from the  future.</p>
<p>Subjectively a coma is already a form of  psychological time travel. That is why so many people who awoke from a  coma have difficulties adapting, and even descirbe it themselves as time  travel (apart from the usual neural damage). Physically it’s not a form  of time travel, unless their body would have been moved to a different  dimension or a different state of being (into an EM wave for instance)  and teleport-like rematerialized at a later stage. Their information,  genetics, their knowledge, character, looks, would have been removed  from this world, and transferred to a later time. So if the G-Man put  Gordon into stasis somewhere in the same universe as earth’s, it would  have been a perfect induced biological coma, I would not call it time  travel. However, the fact that Gordon did not age, and the way Shepard  was put into waiting in the interdimensional flying blackhawk, makes me  assume Gordon was removed from our universe by the G-man.</p>
<p>Thus I think  it is a teleportation into the future, aka time travel.</p>
<p>I still fear that the G-man is in reality something far more sinister than the combine. It’s the way he disapproves of family and friendship. But who knows.</p>

<p>The Borealis appears to be a cargo ship, not a test ship. Maybe the were transporting GLaDOS or companion cubes or even test subjects on the ship. Then something happens and the ship and drydock vanishes to the Arctic, Tobermory discovered later.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I do believe that the reason for Gordon being late at the beginning of  Hl1 is that he time traveled in Hl3 or even Ep3 or something similar  back in time. The Gordon we have been playing all along is a Gordon from  the Future, which would explain his efficiency, skill and the fact he  is too fucked up to talk to people. Also it explains why the G-man never  introduces at the end of Hl1, as no doubt even Aliens would do upon  first contact. He simply states: “Gordon Freeman, in the flesh”.</p>
<p>The sounds playing at the beginning of Hl2, while Gordon is teleported  into the train, sound not like “ordinary” teleportation sounds but like a  weird mix of the old Half-life telports, the Blue shift teleport, the  Kleiner Teleport and the Combine teleport, making me assume that the  G-Mans tech is incredibly advanced, especially as he simply slows time  down to such extent at the end of Hl2 that it seemingly freezes, which  ALREADY is time travel to the future, just like Kleiner’s accidental  slow-teleport.<br>
I doubt he could slow down the time for all matter in the universe. He  is limited to the sphere around the Core and Gordon/Alyx in order to  save them (or just Gordon). Might it be possible that the G-Man has a  “very fast” teleport so to speak? One so fast he teleports into another  string? Or even can close the current string into a circuit?</p>
<p>The vocabulary the G-Man uses is practically constantly hinting at time.</p>
<p>“Time, Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? […] No one is more  deserving of a rest and all the effort in the world would have gone to  waste until [pause] /usually followed by personal pronoun/ well let’s  just say your hour has come again.”</p>
<p>“The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the  world.” Clearly a reference to the BMS incident, as the G-Man  orchestrated it to fight the combine, the orchastration including an  artificially placed Gordon Freeman.</p>
<p>“I trust it will all make sense to you in the course of - well I am really not at liberty to say.” (Time?)</p>

<p>Yes. That’s exactly what Mossman tells you in Black Mesa East.</p>

<p>I think I’ve heard this thousands of times before. Portal Guns aren’t going to appear in Ep3. The’re not practical weapons, they’re not practical teleportation &amp; they’re certainly not the reason an ice breaker disappeared only to be seen over a decade later.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think you’re wrong. The Black Mesa facility had green portals in the lambda core portal puzzle. They were static and only went one direction but they were portals none the less. They just never mounted them on a gun, thats all.</p>

            <p>The Combine are reliant on local transportation once they tunnel through to our world (per Mossman).  If they got their hands on rebel technology (with “entanglement”)… (though that will make you sound like a post-doc).</p>
<p>At the beginning of “Freeman Pontifex”, the vortigaunt says that the Combine “are moving north with great purpose”.  Alyx assumes they’re heading to White Forest to stop the missile, but what if that’s only a side-benefit of going north? Maybe they’re heading to the Borealis (which is in the Arctic…“north” of where you are now) to get a hold of Aperture Science’s portal technology?  Just imagine the Combine with access to portals.</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet Episode 3 is where you have to destroy the Borealis so that the Combine can’t get the portal technology.</p>

            <p>I have a theory about the Borealis.</p>
<p>Don’t you guys think that it’s simply Aperture Science portal technology?</p>
<p>I mean seriously now, think about it: Black Mesa only had those big huge teleports like the ones in Half Life 2, didn’t they?</p>
<p>Aperture Science created the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, that is not only completely safe and reliable, but also handheld and fast.</p>
<p>The Combine doesn’t even know how to teleport inside a single universe, they can only tunnel through from theirs, and then they’re reliant on local transportation. That’s why the Resistance teleport work is guarded.</p>
<p>The Borealis just contains Aperture Science portal technology.</p>
<p>If only the Department of Defense had paid more attention to them, perhaps an ASHPD could be put on rifles, like an M203 grenade launcher. Then, completely to the bafflement of the Combine, Earth’s soldiers could portal all over the place while shooting the Combine’s forces. Not to mention logistical support which would come from the portal technology. All the while, the Combine would be clueless. We could have won the 7 hour war.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>I’m guessing the Borealis returns to the Drydocks, “someone” must of flipped the switch  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I’m sure. Many HL high-experienced veterans think so. It’s gonna be AT LEAST connect to Borealis.</p>
