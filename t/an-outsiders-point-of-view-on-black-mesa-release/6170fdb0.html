          <p>I find it interesting that people make such a large deal out of getting no updates (even though the devs often post information about the mod) about a free project that’s been in the works for such a long time, and not about projects such as Portal 2 or Episode 3. For a long time all we knew about Portal 2 was that they were making it, then they come out with tons of videos and updates and excite everyone. Next thing we know they disappear for months without so much as a Twitter account. And I think Episode 3 pretty much speaks for itself. Here are these projects which cost money to the consumers, and have a lot more people working on them, yet they get none of this pressure from the fanbase to release updates, and the Black Mesa team gets tons and tons of flack for it.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that people make such a large deal out of getting no updates (even though the devs often post information about the mod) about a free project that’s been in the works for such a long time, <span class="bbcode-b">and not about projects such as Portal 2 or Episode 3</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Valve has shown what kind of developer they are, and I personally believe they aren’t doing their fanbase any good by discussing dates they never hit or choosing to stay silent about their unreleased titles currently in development for years on end. They do excellent work, and I know that unlike other developers, I can expect that one day I’ll wake up and the game will be out, and I’ll get around to buying it. But the hype? That’s no longer there because I can’t devote my life to following it and hoping for an update every few days.</p>
<p>The same can be said of Black Mesa, I used to be psyched about it, now once every few months I recall I’m still interested and check the site. But it’s not my life, I don’t play games <span class="bbcode-b">constantly </span>anymore, I have to find the time as my life has gotten necessarily more complex. I quickly check the main page, and I check the news section on the forum. No changes, awesome. For over a year? I can live with that, but now it’s back to hoping I remember to check on it in a few months.</p>
<p>How and why are the developers active in the forum and posting on a wiki (or forum members updating it after a developer says something in a post) but can’t spare the 5 minutes to give an update, include a new screenshot that doesn’t give anything away, acknowledge work is progressing in <span class="bbcode-b">an official capacity</span>.  The mod isn’t just for those that post on the forums, it’s not just for moddb users, and it’s annoying to try and wade through the forum, especially when half the replies people get are ‘check the wiki’ or ‘google it’. It’s called <span class="bbcode-b">The Cafeteria</span>, answer the question respectably or ignore it. I do not care how long you’ve been trolling these forums as others only read it.</p>
<p>Free mod? Okay…<br>
Developers donating their time? Okay…</p>
<p>That doesn’t change what they are building and who their audience is, and in a business that’s about the consumer, it’s completely fair to ask for updates. If nothing, it’s so that I have a reason to continue to be excited, because my life and many others do not allow clinging to the words posted on these forums and want an easy way to see what’s going on.</p>

<p>I have to agree with what you’re saying, since my initial excitment about BM, Portal 2, and other similar titles has definitely faded. However, don’t you find that in the end when something finally comes out, the excitement almost always surges back in greater force after waiting so long? Unless of course the game is a total sham, in which case the experience can only be described through emoticons:  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  then :|,  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningc164.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> , :[ and finally :’(.</p>

          <p>There is a military exercise that consists of taking an army to a location (the desert, for example) and leaving them there for an undisclosed amount of time. They are given no information on when they will be taken home, and all they can do is wait. They say that this is the toughest exercise, due to the fact that waiting indefinitely, without knowing when it will end, is psychologically difficult to bear.</p>
<p>If they were told “we will collect you in 1 year”, they would start complaining and bitching, but at least they would know how much longer they have to wait, and that every day they spend waiting will get them closer to an event that they look forward to.</p>
<p>Another example: the most annoying thing that couples do when they get mad at each other is not speak to each other. It is annoying because it cuts off communication, and you have no idea what’s going on. It avoids new fights, but it’s worse than fighting.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that waiting without knowing why and how much longer is mentally very frustrating. The way humans work is that we set out virtual goals in our minds and feel satisfaction when we get closer to these goals. If the goals are absent, we feel frustrated. It is like sitting in a train with blacked out windows, not knowing whether we are actually moving, going slowly, going fast, almost there, half-way there, or still at the station. Even the feeling of vibrations from the train would be satisfying as we would know that we are moving.</p>
<p>I think that no news is always worse than bad news, it’s much more worrying and frustrating. Of course the developers don’t owe us anything, but the lack of news makes me feel like they really don’t like us for some reason.</p>

          <p>I think this constantly revived debate about updates cannot and will not ever be resolved, both sides have equally good points/reasoning IMO.<br>
I have gone from wanting updates, to thinking we’re better off without them, and back to wanting them. I’m at the point where I don’t really have an opinion either way, whichever way it’s dealt with there will be good and there will be bad repercussions.</p>
<p>In the end, no matter what, all I can say is Thank You to the devs for putting so much time and effort, blood sweat and tears, into this project at least partially for fans of the original Half-Life such as myself at no personal gain. You are all awesome  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> !</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually it was never “dead” as you say, just in developmental hell.  So I think the comparison still fits, as it was fan service that pushed it into being produced.</p>
<p>Again, people are still asking the same recycled question when it comes to why people feel they deserve some attention.  It’s not just about what the devs do or do not have to do for most these folks, I promise you.  There was no money passed.  There was no time volunteered.  It’s something more than that, and if you still don’t understand, then I suggest taking up psychology and reading up on the human condition.  People often invest themselves and their fragile emotions into things they love or desire.  That investment is not easily shaken off.   People want, lest I say deserve, reassurance.  It keeps the darker side of emotion at bay.  Unchecked, without solid ground to walk on, it breaks.  That leads to anger, frustration, depression…the whole works depending on the person.  I know, sounds like the Force.  But it’s true.</p>
<p>If the devs want to avoid more flaming and trolling, at least a good deal of it, they need to understand that one, this is not the only place people look for their information, their reassurance.  Two, people want to be treated like they are important.  That they matter.  As fans, that goes with the territory.  No one wants specifics, they just want to believe that they aren’t being strung along and that this will come to fruition.</p>

          <p>I want to say that I agree 100% with the OP on this. I feel exactly the same way only would have worded it differently. I too have been waiting since the beginning.</p>
<p>I would like to counter some points though.</p>
<ol>
<li>To the fans that have FAITH in the developers</li>
</ol>
<p>Where does this foundation come from? Is it just believe its so? I have seen nothing that the developers have done to give me FAITH that this project will finish or that they have the reputation of Valve to finish it. Remember Valve is being paid they are not. If anything, it is more likely the mod will die. The reason is simple they believed the mod was ready for release over 1 year ago, now as year later its still not done. The only logical conclusion excluding massive data loss is that they are:</p>
<p>A) Lying to us, the mod is nowhere near completion.<br>
B ) Not really working on the project because they feel they have more time with out a release date. So a year is wasted.<br>
C) Don’t know what they’re doing, thinking the mod was ready a year ago when it wasn’t. And that means the mod is still in trouble on being finished.<br>
D) Really just dragging this out hoping that Valve will purchase the game get them off the hook of being free and they get money for it. (Not likely but still considered.)<br>
E) If it were a Data loss why not just say so in the first place, no mention would indicate that didn’t take place, which leaves the above 4.</p>
<p>I see nothing in the above to justify FAITH in this development team that a finished product will be released.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Trolling and Faming.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is REALLY out of control and again the Development team and moderators are at fault. Any BS about release dates and such should be crushed ASAP and the individuals punished with banning. This is not happening, infact I have seen Dev members attack people for their comments, sometimes justified, sometimes not. Again all of this trolling TURNS away people who are interested in the mod, but not the BS that would be expected from a 13 year olds TeleTubby show forum.</p>
<p>The Moderators zeal to close threads or post warnings for minor offenses or things they DON’T like to hear about the mod, but NOT using the same Zeal to prevent Trolling and Flamming does not give me confidence in the Dev Team much less FAITH. If they allow this forum to degenerate into a Troll paradise where FALSE release dates can be posted and not properly corrected, how can I trust ANYTHING the moderators or Dev team say?</p>
<p>These forums are a reflection of THEM whether they wish otherwise or not.<br>
That reflection from a NON-FAN point of view is not good, and I am sure other Magazine and Websites that deal with upcoming mods and games feel the same way as I do. This mod isn’t our life, but it’s irritating with the behavior from most of the Forum members and the lack thereof from the Mod Developers.</p>
<p>May only maturity continue in this thread?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Firefly101</p>

          <p>Take a breath dude, I really don’t know what you want from the dev’s. There is no conspiracy they are just trying to make a mod and all this negative bullshit is just extrapolating time and effort from the mod in order to calm the nerves of the weak minded.</p>
<p>They are just cracking on with the mod answering a few questions along the way. My solution for your ailment is to have a double dosage of get-the-fuck-out-the-forum-for-a-few-months-100mg.</p>

          <p>Y’know, I’m not sure what people really want in terms of an update? I’d say there is more than enough media already released. It’s not like we are going to get that much more in the way of details. So basically the only updates that the devs would be willing to provide without spoiling things is ‘Yes, we are still working on it.’</p>
<p>Funnily enough they have said this repeatedly in the forums, and there is no indication on MODDB, or on the webpage that the mod is cancelled so unless you expect a twitter update once a week that says ‘still working’ ( which is quite pointless ) , or everyone just relaxes and waits.</p>
<p>Has it taken longer than anyone had hoped? yeah.<br>
Has there been much in the way of updates in a long while? No, but that’s mostly because of the already large amount of media and information already out there. Personally I would rather the team keep working on the mod, rather than worry about my emotional state relating to their status.</p>
<p>Also, you don’t like it? Too bad, fuck off.</p>

          <p>Grief Reaper,</p>
<p>No one said conspiracies, just because I have 2 quotes from US founding fathers in my signature doesn’t mean I am a conspiracy hound. This is the second time you stated that when replying to my posts. Second, your comment on weak minded is just the opposite, those that blindly support anything from the dev team or of the majority are the weak-minded. Actually based on the Trolling and attacks in this forum, those that stand up and state their opinions against the majority fan base are anything but weak minded. But your statement rings with sociopath tendencies in your personality.</p>
<p>MaxTheLimit,</p>
<p>Your rudeness and attacks are uncalled for, this forum was proceeding in maturity, and then right after my statement on maturity, two immature posts were made. Please let those that wish to state their opinion with respect and clarity do so, you have an entire forum to Troll and Flame who you like. Without telling them to Fuck-Off or get out of the forums, just because you don’t like their opinions.</p>
<p>This is all another example of why the Dev team or the moderators should not have faith placed in them. This forum is out of control, and what is the most scariest thing, is that the people committing these offenses are old enough to know better.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say is that waiting without knowing why and how much longer is mentally very frustrating. The way humans work is that we set out virtual goals in our minds and feel satisfaction when we get closer to these goals. If the goals are absent, we feel frustrated. It is like sitting in a train with blacked out windows, not knowing whether we are actually moving, going slowly, going fast, almost there, half-way there, or still at the station. Even the feeling of vibrations from the train would be satisfying as we would know that we are moving.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sorry for long post, but it has to be said.</p>
<p>Higgs, you have my respect. And continuing your analogies, I would like to use one that I have long believed myself. At the moment, waiting for Black Mesa is like waiting on a platform for a train with no timetable whatsoever. It may be a minute away, or it may be another 8 hours. But the torture of not knowing is what is making everyone so frustrated and angry, and this applies to a lot of the older members, whether they realise it or not.</p>
<p>As soon as you have a schedule and an estimated time of arrival, then people relax, and everything is put into context. But without this, it is chaos. You can see the ripples of this emanating from the various promises, rumours and hints that have plagued this mod from its very outset. Most recently, we’ve had an onslaught of new members arriving and complaining (some politely, others not so) about the lack of updates. This emanates from the rumours and various hints dropped by developers about the mod’s release in either late 2010 or early 2011. Just look at the surge in popularity of the Cafeteria forum and compare it to the steady decline of the Suggestion Box, once the most popular forum. Also look at the staggering rise in the number of guests appearing.</p>
<p>The same thing was witnessed in 2009, when it became apparent that the mod was not coming out. The reason for this was, I believe, because it was an announcement that said it <span class="bbcode-i">is </span>coming out this year, rather than it may be, or we are aiming for this date. And for the developers to miss this date by over a year without another official announcement, I can full well understand the frustration experienced by everyone. It’s like waiting at the station platform for a train that’s meant to arrive at 9, but then waiting another hour and there still being no word as to its arrival. Yes the train will <span class="bbcode-i">eventually </span>arrive and it will be awesome, but part of the enjoyment is in the anticipation, and so far Black Mesa’s has been nothing short of torturous.</p>
<p>Before anyone starts shouting at me, I’ve been a forum member here since 2006, and had been observing the mod since 2005. I fully understand, perhaps more than most here, the reasons for the delay, the lack of updates and the supposed silence of the developers. But it is hard to deny that the communication between the developers and their fanbase has been somewhat… inconsistent. The reason, and the only reason, that there has been so much anger against BM recently, is the lack of communication.</p>
<p>By that I don’t mean pointless updates about what you’re working on, confirmation that you’re still alive etc. but <span class="bbcode-i">real verbal communication</span>. It’s inconsistent if you announce with big fanfare that the mod is nearly done and that it’s to be released in 2009, and then say absolutely nothing official for over a year. People are understanding, and as higgs said - bad news is so much better than no news. No one expects a film, game or mod to give an exact release date down to the date and time and to stick to that, but when you announcesomething with such vigour and fervour, and then say nothing for over a year, you can understand the frustration. If you realise that you aren’t going to make the release date, then tell us and give us a reason! It’s because of this lack of official substance that people are now, in desperation, turning to rumour for news.</p>
<p>If you release screenshots and videos, people will begin to assess, judge and start guessing release dates based on the quality of the work. But if you communicate verbally and officially, simply <span class="bbcode-i">describing </span>what you are doing will be enough for most people. It’s much harder for people to misconstrue what you say, and it is easier for you as the developers to manage what people think. Taking Ross Scott’s blog as a perfect example - reading the comments section after each update, even though a project may have been delayed four times now, 99% of comments are those of encouragement and support. This would not be the same if he had promised something in one year, failed to release, and then said nothing for the next year. <a href="https://www.accursedfarms.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.accursedfarms.com/</a></p>
<p>I know and believe that the developers don’t owe us a thing. If they wanted to, they would be within their right to release no information or media about the mod until it was released. But by releasing media, information and a release date, you are <span class="bbcode-i">setting your own standard of communication</span> that people come to expect. By going against this, for whatever reason, the community feel betrayed and you then get all the anger against the mod that I would say is understandable, if not justifiable.</p>
<p>In closing, whether the developers have realised it or not, the lack of verbal communication, even something as simple as an explanation, have incurred the anger of a (possibly overzealous) community who feel frustrated that they are stranded with no news of when Black Mesa will arrive. The most hurtful of these is the lack of an explanation of the failure of the 2009 release date by over a year. Most will have guessed as to its reason, but in the lack of updates, you get a lot of anger, flaming, pointless threads, but most critically - bad publicity. The latter is evident in BM’s reputation on other forums - the reputation of a forum whose members flame and insult, and whose developers show a haughty and disdainful character in their abnormal and arguably unprofessional, lack of official communication. This isn’t necessarily my opinion, but in my experience it is the reputation. If the developers are content in this, fair enough, but some communication would undoubtedly help to stem the flow of chaos in these forums as well as restoring their reputation as the best and most ambitious mod in history. I don’t believe anyone can deny that this has fallen in the year following their failure to meet their release date.</p>
