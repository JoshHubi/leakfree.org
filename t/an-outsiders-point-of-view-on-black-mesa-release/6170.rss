    <title>An outsider&#39;s point of view on Black Mesa Release</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/an-outsiders-point-of-view-on-black-mesa-release/6170</link>
    <description>Before you &quot;old timers&quot; try and toss me to the flames, I have been around a LONG time, though never bothered to register, as I hadn&#39;t much to say.  But I have been watching this mod since it&#39;s inception.  I&#39;ve gotten more involved lately, mostly in the MODDB threads.  Yes, I know there&#39;s a lot of trolling and flaming going on there.  But I&#39;m going to have my peace here, for the first time, in hopes that the Devs see it and take it to heart.

We, the rabid fans, made them.  No, I know they made the concept, they work the development of such an undertaking.  Serious question.  If no one, not one single voice was heard in support of such a mod, do you think they would have continued?  Maybe.  I seriously doubt anyone wants to move forward with a monumental task if no one will pat them on the shoulder and say good job.  Or vote them best upcoming mod and win them a pretty uber PC.  So it&#39;s pretty solid that without us, The Black Mesa Team is nothing.  Not meant out of disrespect, but it&#39;s leading to my point.

I&#39;d have to say other than a minuscule amount of brown nosers and a good number of die hard followers, a good deal of the community following this are angry and let down.  Some because of the wait time, but for most it&#39;s the lack of real communication.  The lack of updates.  I know, treading on old ground here.  Most people did not spend some of their live watching this baby grow just to get hit with child support (fandom) and no visitation rights.  So what if this does not cost us a dime?  So what if people tell you you have no right to bitch?  If you did not want it so bad or need it so bad, if it were not for the fans, this would never exist, or would fade into obscurity. 

Hell, if this never comes out, it&#39;s not going to kill me.  If and when Half Life 3 comes out on a new engine, someone will attempt this project again, it&#39;s not going to change the way people feel.  I&#39;m not a rabid flamer or troll, though I feel the onslaught of people&#39;s hate and blind lust growing as I prepare to release my rant.  I don&#39;t really care.  The whole point is I wanted to share my thoughts.  I wanted to be heard.  If the devs see this and respond, kudos.  I don&#39;t expect them to, they&#39;re hard at work.  But you all need to remember, this isn&#39;t a new form of anger or distrust.  It&#39;s happened before, to the excess of legal repercussions because one man strung along an entire community and fed off their generosity, only to be proven false.    Don&#39;t act like people don&#39;t have a reason to be fearful.


here&#39;s to hoping Black Mesa is released soon.  Here&#39;s to the Devs if they can pull this off, and here&#39;s to them if they can open a new line of trust and communication with the common folk that made them what they are today: Famous.  But may they burn in Hades if they are stringing us along and lying to us.  Nuff Said.</description>

            <p>“this needs to be locked” is just adding static to a thread that would otherwise die a normal death.</p>
<p>Why do we always have to get to a point where the thread has to be LOCKED in order to let it die? Why cant we all just either stay on TOPIC or just NOT POST.</p>

<p>i find that kind of offending.And i do believe that 2d graphics never get old…but that doesnt work for 3d(in my case).Let’s just say that i’m a gamer for no less than 12 years.And i do find it hard to wait for a game…that is based on an engine already developed,a story already known for such a long time.I really think it should be finished by now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why should the devs bend over backwards to provide a larger audience of strangers with a mod that quite clearly has had many hours put into it. I really cannot see the need for conspiracy theories or just general animosity towards the devs for just cracking on with their work. They aren’t busy spoon feeding the public by regularly changing the site because there are more important things to be getting on with (like the mod for example)</p>
<p>Also, please, for those who keep using phrases like ‘No information is being passed to the fan base’ or ‘This mod hasn’t updated in ages’ to spare you the trauma of having to click your mouse twice, you can just click once <a href="https://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Special:RecentChanges" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and browse to your hearts content. These are the updates, they pretty much will always be the updates until the mods release. If your unhappy with this, come back when the mod is finished. Also:</p>

            <p>What’s interesting about that rocket launcher is that it says “Black Mesa Research Facility Property” on the side. Why does Black Mesa need to have rocket launchers around?<br>
I guess it could be a relic from the old days as a military base, but it looks awful new and fancy.</p>
<p>Also, that instructions picture is hilarious.</p>
