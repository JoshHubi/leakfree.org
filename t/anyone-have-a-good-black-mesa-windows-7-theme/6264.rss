    <title>Anyone have a good Black Mesa Windows 7 Theme?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/anyone-have-a-good-black-mesa-windows-7-theme/6264</link>
    <description>I am not quite sure if i am in the right area to post this but i will post here anyway. I am trying to make my gaming computer and laptop look as though it were from black mesa with a black mesa start orb, login screen, custom sounds, and even a one frame mouse which i would also like to have a request for. I need a theme that can work for windows 7 ultimate and home premium because my laptop i never upgraded so i need some kind of theme that can change the usual taskbar, start menu, icons, maybe even a nice cursor but i really need this to complete the process. I have been surfing and lurking all over the internets trying to find a theme that wasn&#39;t an obvious virus or was too difficult for most people to make. Plz if you can help me if you don&#39;t have a theme please contribute anything to help me with this. Thank you for reading and have a good day.</description>

            <p>All I can contribute to is the start orb. It’s just a simple black and orange lambda symbol I think I actually got from a thread in this forum site. I’ll do a little digging to see if I can find what web-site I got the program from that gives you the ability to change your start orb.</p>
<p>You can do a little digging in the forums to search what thread the lambda symbol could be from. Because I just can’t remember that far back. And frankly I don’t want to do a whole lot of searching for you when I did the search myself way back when.</p>
