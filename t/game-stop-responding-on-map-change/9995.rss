    <title>game stop responding on map change</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-stop-responding-on-map-change/9995</link>
    <description>The game stops responding at the map change from c3a1a to the next map. I can not show a mdmp file due to the fact that hl2 stops responding, I have to end the hl2 process in the task manager. I have tried extracting the maps and replace them and that does not work. I have also tried using all the tricks I have learned from playing half life games. and I have been playing them for a long time. about 15 years or so. I do not know if it something with the mod or with my pc.</description>
