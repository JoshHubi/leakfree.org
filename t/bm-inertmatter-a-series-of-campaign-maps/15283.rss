            <p>It might be some internal z-fighting on the the LOD submodel those props are using. I can’t quite tell from the screenshot, but those are monitors, right? Try replacing them with another monitor model and see if it still happens.</p>
<p>Also just for reference jadebenn, while it’s good practice to func_detail brushes using translucent and alpha masked materials, I’m <span class="bbcode-i">fairly </span>certain the compile tools do that automatically.</p>

<p>I was referring to the fact that there are two “labcrete” textures, one darker and one lighter.

<p>i dont think theres anything very technically impressive about what i did i feel like i often end up throwing an absurd amount of light and light_spot entitys at a wall until it negates my inability to understand sources old timey ways of rendering. i do constantly draw on my knowledge of light shadow and color as i understand them from techniques in representational art mostly painting. heres what it looks like in hammer <em>snip</em></p>

</aside>
<p>That is extremely well explained. Considering you have so much grey and so much warm lights, maybe go for yellow/orange lines or highlights for the walls? Even just the navigational lines would do the trick.</p>

most of the principles i find useful are explained in great detail in the book, color and light by james gurney.  also looking into the sun with HDR on helps</p>

</aside>
<p>do you think the “grey” issue is merely a low level of detail problem the vernacular just makes me think there might also be a lighting issue i can never tell how much saturation of color is enough but i do agree that the walls are blatantly comprised of the same texture</p>

            <p>Impressive! The office areas overall extremely nice, and while the HEV suit room looks a little bare the others have a good mix of props and level geometry. I would suggest replacing the doors in images 2 and 5 with either solid brown ones or the red or grey fire doors, as both are used to the exclusion of the narrow-window type in Office Complex.</p>

            <p>Personally, I think they look great!<br>
The only major issues I have are that the color of the sky doesn’t look real at all and the color of the light on the floor of the last image is way too blue.<br>
Other than that, great job!</p>
