    <title>Your ideal Half-Life 3 trailer.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/your-ideal-half-life-3-trailer/8360</link>
    <description>Since a month or so back, with the huge lot of HL3 speculation and rumors such as the t-shirt and the fake websites, I&#39;ve been on a Half-Life binge. One could say my interest has been rekindled, as I&#39;ve already begun another playthrough of Half-Life 1 and it&#39;s expansions.

 But I&#39;ve been thinking. There will be a day when Half-Life 3 is officially announced, and with it many can expect more eery G-Man monologues and cries of fear as the combine come in with their guns&#39;a&#39;blazing. One thing is for sure, is that when it&#39;s announced there will be a trailer at some time or another. 

 So here&#39;s what I ask you: If you were the director of the official Half-Life 3 trailer, what would be in it? Try to the best of your abilities to explain in text what the perfect trailer for the game would be like in your eyes.


[b]TL;DR[/SIZE][/b]

Hey, what kinda trailer would you like to see for Half-Life 3?[/SIZE]</description>

            <p>I’d like something of a mix between your two.</p>
<p>Maxeys get up and look at Alyx bit, then fade to black with the 3 becoming apparent. Then start in with the snow, move onto some new enemies, the boat, then the Gman walking through it. Saying something vague but smaller than what chancey has in mind.</p>

            <p>The screen starts black. Slowly a shot of a desolate frozen landscape fades in. It appears to be an outside camera shot, but as the screen moves back you can see that it’s actually taken from inside of a broken down ship, with the camera facing out the window.</p>
<p>The scene switches to that of the hallway in the ship. Wind breezes can be seen flying through the windows. This moment of serenity is interrupted by a man in blue with a briefcase walking down the hall, adjusting his tie.</p>
<p>The camera follows this man as different camera shots show him rummaging through his pockets as if to be looking for something. He eventually finds himself in a room, similar to a dining room. The man lays his briefcase down on the table as he pulls a key out of his pocket. He opens the briefcase.</p>
<p>“The escalation of your value is apparent. While not every man is entitled to his supposed earnings, he is entitled to his own life — or so it may seem. Tell me, if the puppeteer does all the work, but the puppet gets all the praise, does the puppeteer’s existence have any merit? Debatable I’m sure, but one might think that both roles offer equal benefits; to be in control, or to be the hero. Which road do you walk down, Mr. Freeman”</p>
<p>The man pulls a picture out of the briefcase. The last camera shot shows a picture of Black Mesa Ground Zero.</p>
<p>The camera fade to black as a faint grey lambda logo fades on and off the screen.</p>

<p>Cold open; wide shot of Eli dead, slumped on the floor, a steady stream of blood coming out of his mouth; Alyx crying over his body.</p>
<p>Suddenly the camera pans up, this Gordon Freeman’s point of view. He looks directly at the helicopter, then stands up on his feet and reaches his hand towards Alyx.</p>
<p>Alyx looks at Gordon and quickly understands that there’s no time to lose, so she grabs Gordon’s hand, gets up and looks back towards the helicopter.</p>
<p>Scene suddenly shifts to black and a 3 appears in the center of the screen. Slowly but surely, something faded starts appearing behind the 3 and getting bigger and faster towards the screen; they’re blurred images from the game that get gradually sharper with each new picture. Finally it stops at the last picture, which is a picture of the Borealis stuck in a huge ice cap. Something starts coming out of it and in the direction of the camera, with the 3 still there. It gets closer to it quickly and we finally see that it’s a Combine scanner. The scanner keeps coming towards us, filling the whole screen until it flies past it, revealing the rest of the title to be Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>Fade to black, Valve credits.</p>
<p>And that’s how I would make the teaser trailer.</p>

<p>Kudos maxey, that is pretty good. I’d change the scanner for the Gman though and have him say something. The Gman gotta say something, even if it’s something as simply as ‘time to finish the experiment’. It’s the lawz.</p>

            <p>I’d like it if the screen started out black, while bits of used dialogue from Dr. Breen, Eli, and Vortigaunts concerning the gman fades in and out, slowly getting louder until it becomes a blurred roar.<br>
<em>G-man Coughs</em><br>
The screen pans over as Gman stands against the darkness.<br>
He tells you to forget about all that, you still have a job to do. Now.<br>
His voice falters,<br>
something’s wrong…</p>
<p>A monotone note fades into hearing as ‘HALF-LIFE 3’ flickers onto the screen, before quickly flickering out.<br>
The note ends.<br>
The trailer ends.</p>

<p>Scene suddenly shifts to black and a 3 appears in the center of the screen. Slowly but surely, something faded starts appearing behind the 3 and getting bigger and faster towards the screen; they’re blurred images from the game that get gradually sharper with each new picture. Finally it stops at the last picture, which is a picture of the Borealis stuck in a huge ice cap. Something starts coming out of it and in the direction of the camera, with the 3 still there. It gets closer to it quickly and we finally see that it’s a Combine scanner. The scanner keeps coming towards us, filling the whole screen until it flies past it, revealing the rest of the title to be Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>Fade to black, Valve credits.</p>
<p>And that’s how I would make the teaser trailer.</p>

<p>I think Maxey should be Valve’s new media producer. Bravo.</p>

<p>Cold open; wide shot of Eli dead, slumped on the floor, a steady stream of blood coming out of his mouth; Alyx crying over his body.</p>
<p>Suddenly the camera pans up, this Gordon Freeman’s point of view. He looks directly at the helicopter, then stands up on his feet and reaches his hand towards Alyx.</p>
<p>Alyx looks at Gordon and quickly understands that there’s no time to lose, so she grabs Gordon’s hand, gets up and looks back towards the helicopter.</p>

            <p>Remember the old days when Trailers were for films and Demos were for games?</p>
<p>Now game designers think they’re making movies and only release trailers.<br>
They are reluctant to release a demo since the gamer would suddenly be aware that the devs spent more time making it look like a movie than they did on actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid 4 is a classic example of a movie which happened to include some occasional gameplay.<br>
Dead Island is another example of game which had a fantastic trailer but didn’t work so well as a game.<br>
Do Demos even exist anymore?  God forbid you should let anyone actually play the game before buying.  And the industry wonders why people pirate!</p>
