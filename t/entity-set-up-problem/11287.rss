    <title>Entity Set-Up Problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/entity-set-up-problem/11287</link>
    <description>I have a bit of an entity setup problem, and decompiling BM maps to figure out how you guys did it didn&#39;t work. (Perhaps the devs used decompile protection, or maybe I&#39;m just using an outdated decompiler)
I have a func_50cal and a prop_dynamic with the .50 cal model. The func_50cal is set up so the prop_dynamic is its parent, gets animated on firing and the muzzle flash comes from the barrel&#39;s attachment point. However, when I rotate the gun while using it, the model does not track with the func_50cal&#39;s barrel and firing.

So the muzzle flash is right on track, attached to the barrel model, and I think I have the rate of fire, yaw and pitch limits roughly the same as in BM, so those work too. But why is the body of the gun model not moving with the brush? What settings do I have to use? Is there something that has to be done differently than with a func_tank using the combine AR2 emplacement model, or am I just missing something obvious that&#39;s shared between func_50cal and func_tank?</description>

            <p>Alright, I’ll have another go at decompiling. I used BSPSource, but I didn’t set any parameters, I assumed it would autodetect/not need them to decompile. My bad.<br>
EDIT: Yup, got it to work, just had to set the game parameters from the default autodetect/generic to Source 2007.</p>

            <p>Use BSPSource and decompile under Source 2007 map format. I ran into your problem decompiling the final map for my Xen project.</p>
<p>You need to set the proper model rotation points, and all that wonderful stuff.</p>
