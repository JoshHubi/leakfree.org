    <title>Antlion Love?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/antlion-love/1666</link>
    <description>Ok, I have been working on a mod of my own while following BMS (which looks amazing from what I have seen) and ran into an issue, considering the entire mod is baised around Bugbait and Portals, the issue is a major one

The Antlions yes they are friendly to me, but they wont follow me around when I have the bait out. i have Ai_nodes and Hint Nodes laid out, I have a hint group for a seprate Npc, behind glass. And for one it never messed around with my pets before, but they never follow me. They respond to the bug bait being fired, they&#39;ll go to the target, but they are very irresponcinve to me.

Thank you in advance

<p>Make an env_global entity in your map and set the globalstate to antlion_allied.</p>
<p>Try that…</p>

</aside>
<p>Ok they do like me now (and yes I did feed them recently) however they do not follow behind me, I have AI and HINT nodes special for the antlions, but they do not follow the player around. Is there anything else that would need to be done</p>
<p>Thanks for responding (and sorry it took so long for me to respond, computer in the chop shop [bizzarely for repair])</p>
