    <title>Running and strafing at the same time</title>

    <description>Hi,

I can&#39;t seem to run and strafe at the same time in BM - I&#39;m pretty sure you can in all the other games, as I&#39;ve realised it&#39;s how I move about and look around most of the time, and not being able to do it feels really awkward.

Has anyone else noticed this?  Will there be a way to change it or is it programmed in?</description>
