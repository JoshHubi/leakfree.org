    <title>Help with 1080p</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/help-with-1080p/1373</link>
    <description>Okay, so my tv is 1080p capable.  While the 360 was hooked up via analog, the option for 1080p was clickable, but it resulted in a blue screen which would revert to 1080i.

Today, I hooked my 360 up to an audio/visual receiver with an HDMI cable.  Eager to make it 1080p, I opened up the menu, only to discover that hooking it up greyed out the 1080p option entirely.  Why is this?  What must I do!?</description>

            <p>Well, if you haven’t connected your Xbox to your TV directly, then I suggest trying that next. It sounds like your TV is unable to communicate its EDID through your AV receiver to your Xbox for some reason, therefore your Xbox doesn’t know your TV supports 1080p and grays that option out automatically. As for why it didn’t gray out over component, I’m not sure, but either the TV was able to communicate its EDID, or component doesn’t support that feature and the Xbox leaves the 1080p option open.</p>

            <p>Good question…I don;t know myself, as I’m not home.  This is coming from my brother…I’ll ask tonight over the phone.  I believe the 360 is connected to the receiver via an HDMI cable.  But I’m not sure…</p>
<p>But, just to clarify, my TV does support 1080p.</p>
<p>Really, this whole thread is to determine why the option wasn’t greyed out over component but is with the receiver connected.</p>

<p>What the hell are you smoking mate. What do you mean by “connected my HDMI”? HDMI is an interface and a HDMI cable connects two appliances through this interface. So what was connected to what via HDMI? Xbox to AV receiver was via HDMI? AV receiver to TV was via HDMI? :fffuuu:</p>
