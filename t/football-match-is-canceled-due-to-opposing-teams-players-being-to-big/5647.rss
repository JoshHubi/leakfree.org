            <p>My highschool class was huge. We had a good 20 people professional NFL sized, freshman year. We lost almost every game all four years I went to that school, the three my older brother went before me, the three my younger brother went after, and the three years my sister went after that. We have one of the worst armored rugby teams in the world  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<li>No one in my family dropped out. There was a year overlap between each sibling.</li>

            <p>Personally I think that sports should be removed from schools completely. Not P.E. mind you, just sports. Schools spend so much of their budgets on sports instead of actual teaching that Its ridiculous. I live in Copperas Cove, Texas, a smallish city next to Fort Hood. Our computer labs have five year old broken down pieces of $4!7 which are in desperate need of replacement, but god forbid out football team doesn’t get brand new equipment every other year. That is complete bull that they would rather buy more sports equipment than do their job and buy more teaching equipment. Absolutely unacceptable.</p>

            <p>Private school isn’t nearly the same as public school.  In public school, you usually play the sport because you love playing it.  It’ not going to be like that nearly as often in private school.</p>
<p>It would have been funny to go to that game if it hadn’t been canceled just to watch the rich assholes get hurt and whine about it.</p>

            <p>Well, it’s a school team, not a professional league team. So the teachers take responsibility for any injuries the students take during a match, right? Parents would come bust their doors open and torture them to death if their children got hurt.</p>
<p>I would have backed out, too.</p>

            <p>They should suck it up.  In any sport, if the other team has larger players, that’s too bad.  If you’re scheduled to play them, you play them, don’t wuss out.  If you have complaints, join a girly-man league instead of a regular league.<br>
