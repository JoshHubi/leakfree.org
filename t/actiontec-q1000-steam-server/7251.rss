    <title>Actiontec Q1000 Steam Server?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/actiontec-q1000-steam-server/7251</link>
    <description>Has anyone been able to successfully forward ports on an Actiontec/Qwest Q1000 modem/router? Ever? I can&#39;t get the thing to open port 27015 no matter what I do.

Edit for more info: I&#39;m trying to get a Sven Co-op game (or counter-strike... or the PC version of Decay) started. I create a server, make sure it&#39;s set to sv_lan 0 and the other player tries to join. Unable to connect. I try having them open the console and manually connect to my IP and :27015 (should be the right port), still can&#39;t connect. I turned off indows Firewall and the firewall built into the Q1000, along with AVG just to be sure. Still no. I forwarded the ports listed on Sven Co-op&#39;s website to port 192.168.0.2. No luck. I forwarded the ports to the remote IP listed on whatismyip.com. Nothing. I change my IP to static (with 3rd party software since doing this in the router config drops my internet connection) and make it 192.168.0.150 and forward the ports to that. Still nothing. I call a guy who I thought would know the answer. He goes through the same stuff and comes up empty.
PLEASE, for the love of all that is good, can anyone give me a suggestion besides throwing this crappy modem/router in front of the nearest train?</description>

            <p>setmaster add :27015<br>
setmaster enable :27015<br>
sv_lan 0<br>
heartbeat</p>
<p>Whatever those magic words did, it fixed the problem despite 27015 still showing closed. THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone else for the suggestions too. This community is awesome  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>See if you can enable UPnP on your router, then download a freeware port forwarding program that can do the rest for you.</p>
<p>For all you know, your problem isn’t even with the ports not being forwarded. Download a port checker (I use <a href="https://portforward.com/help/portcheck.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a> since it is more accurate than most other websites that check your ports) to see if they forwarded correctly. If they are, then the problem lies elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Copy the IP (you have it static, right?)<br>
go ingame, type in console:<br>
[b]<br>
setmaster add :27015<br>
setmaster enable :27015<br>
sv_lan 0<br>
heartbeat</p>
<p>[/b]This has always worked for me and only on GoldSrc</p>
<p>(Maybe your 27015 IS open without you knowing it)</p>
