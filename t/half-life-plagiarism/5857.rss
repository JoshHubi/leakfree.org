    <title>Half Life, Plagiarism?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-plagiarism/5857</link>
    <description>I noticed, headcrabs look and act very similar(attach to head) to the alien babies from Alien. Alien was made before Half Life. Could this be plagiarism? Is there any other ideas that could have been stolen?
Discuss, bitches.</description>

<p>Dear god, this thread is hurting my brain. Alright guys, look. It’s a science fiction story. There are idea you can use that are free game. space travel, aliens, teleportation, government conspiracies, strange fucked-up tentacle monsters, scientists that get slaughtered en masse, strange weaponry, anti-gravity machinery, super-powered techno suits, plasma guns, otherworldly godlike beings. These things are all typical sci-fi fare, and they’re all in Half-Life. Original ideas typically don’t come out of the blue; they’re ideas built upon other ideas. You would know this if you’ve ever come up with something of worth.</p>
<p>The headcrab was invented by Ted Backman, who has admitted “his inspirations for the Half-Life creatures was H.R. Giger’s Necronomicon paintings and its sexual innuendos” (<a href="https://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Ted_Backman" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">sauce</a>). That doesn’t mean he COPIED!!!111!1~1!3243~! H.R. Giger. If you’ll notice, the headcrab and the facehugger have two things in common: jumping and claws. That’s it. This man did not look at the facehugger and say “LET’S USE THAT BUT MAKE IT DIFFERENT BSRLKJDASDF!” That is retarded. He is an extremely talented artist and it’s an insult to artists everywhere to assume that simply because something has a vague, superficial resemblance to something else that it must be a direct rip-off. This is something that annoys me greatly about the internet.</p>
<p>Half-Life is one of the most original games in decades. These guys busted their asses creating a game that was unlike any other game at the time, in both gameplay/mechanics and storyline. Of course they were inspired by other works. Of course they paid tribute to other things. This is not wrong. Nor is it illegal. Is the Madonna and Child any less a work of art simply because it’s a painting of the virgin Mary? OBVIOUSLY MICHAELANGELO WAS RIPPING OFF DA VINCI’S THE VIRGIN IN THE ROCKS DURRRR.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to offend anyone, and this isn’t a direct attack on anyone in particular. I just get rather zealous about things sometimes. You understand.</p>

Also, DOOM had armour that was bought cheap from an army surplus store. But at least they paid for it - everyone else just stole it out of DOOM.</p>

<p>It would really suck if Black Mesa was actually Black Mesa. Then one day, we are gonna go to Hell cuz a guy in a metal suit was tricked into pushing a potentially dangerous item into an electric beam.</p>
<p>Then I would have to join the Resistance. 20 years from now.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>even the location hints at it. Area 51 is located in New Mexico. Black Mesa is a real place (not the labs lol) and is very close to where Area 51 is supposed to be. Area 51 is actually just a Air Force Base.</p>
