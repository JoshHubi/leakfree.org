    <title>Knight of the force part II is coming out</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/knight-of-the-force-part-ii-is-coming-out/8109</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not quite sure if there is anybody waiting for it or even know about it, so I will introduce a little about KOTF.

[b]Knight of the force (KOTF)[/b] is a mod of [i]Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy[/i], an fps-tps shooter action game released in 2003

This mod was released the [u]first[/u] part in 2008 and the second part&#39;s release date was postponed to the indefinite time.(like Blackmesa)

But hey, last week, Tim had posted something exciting about the mod [url=&#39;https://kotf.com/main.htm&#39;]on his site![/url]

Time to join the full mod!!!!! :smiley: :&#39;( :smiley: :&#39;(</description>

            <p>I’ll probably play it whenever I get Jedi Academy, Outcast is my primary objective for PC Star Wars games atm.</p>

<p>I have never heard of it before, but I sure am interested.</p>
<p>Is it worth downloading KotF now, or just waiting a month (or more) for the english version of KotFII to be released?</p>
<p>Im thinking mostly about single player BTW.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>yeah, if I were you, I’ll be patient until the releasing of full mod. The single player is great, especially in <span class="bbcode-b">real-life saber mode</span>, you can cut off their limbs, that’s funny.</p>

            <p>I really didn’t care for Academy that much. I would much rather have seen a total conversion of Jedi Knight or Jedi Outcast. It seems there were some planned but I think they sorta fizzled out. Ah well, guess it’s good news for Academy fans.</p>
