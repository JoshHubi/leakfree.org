    <title>[Solved] Clicking on play doesn&#39;t do anything.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/solved-clicking-on-play-doesnt-do-anything/9598</link>
    <description>It wasn&#39;t completely obvious so I&#39;m making a post here for others who may be stuck.

Black Mesa requires the &quot;Source SDK Base 2007&quot; installed to run.  If you are clicking on &quot;Play&quot; in Steam and it isn&#39;t doing anything then that may be your issue.

To install the SDK, in Steam, in your &quot;Library&quot; tab click on the drop-down where it says &quot;All Games&quot;, &quot;Installed Games&quot;, etc.  In that drop-down choose &quot;Tools&quot; and in that list your will see &quot;Source SDK Base 2007.&quot;  Right-click on that and choose &quot;Install Game.&quot;

Once that is downloaded and installed you should now be able to launch Black Mesa.</description>

            <p>Looks like you’re right. Tried reinstalling HL2 and I ran into the same problem. Might have to check the Steam Forums for a solution. Just one of those days I guess.</p>

<p>Ok, you are having a different error.  My error, without the SDK, <span class="bbcode-i">nothing</span> happened.  Click on “Play” and nothing happened: no “Preparing to launch” not a thing.</p>

            <p>Is anything happening at all?  Like is it going to a black screen or otherwise crashing?</p>
<p>The original post is what solved my issue: nothing at all happening when I clicked “Play.”</p>
