Pretty sure the GOP is thrilled (or should I say... DRILLED? hohoho) about this legislation of the commie president.

So, what are your thoughts on this?</description>

</aside>
<p>Wait, what? The government doesnt’ tell us what to buy at all. What a socialist government does do, however, is offer the consumer a certain incentive to pick the more ecological light bulb/car. This happens through all sorts of means, like cutting the tax on it (GASP), giving out specific checks, or just flat out reduce the price of it. But in no way do they limit you to -only- buying a specific light bulb or car or kind of paint or whatever.</p>
<p>It pretty much comes down to this:<br>
You:<br>
“Light bulb A” -&gt; $2<br>
“Light bulb B” -&gt; $2<br>
“Light bulb C (Ecological)” -&gt; $2</p>
<p>Socialist murderer/rapist/monster/brute/savage:<br>
“Light bulb A” -&gt; $2<br>
“Light bulb B” -&gt; $2<br>
“Light bulb C (Ecological)” -&gt; $1.5</p>
<p>You see? You still have the same choices, there’s just the extra incentive to think about the future of you and those around you.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s your decision to commit long-term suicide, but it isn’t your decision to kill other people in the process. Cigarettes are not just unhealthy to you, but anyone near you. And while I realize this probably just an example, it’s a very bad one.</p>
<p>I for one love the fact that they’re increasing the price of cigarettes and banning them from bars/pubs/diners/restaurants (over here at least). And it’s not like they’re taking away your freedom by making cigarettes more expensive. Hell, they’re giving you even more freedom by giving you more choices (instead of “what brand”, you get “what brand… or should I just quit smoking?”/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Small things, like the government tells you what kind of light bulbs you have to buy, the car you can drive…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>A socialist economy doesn’t tell you to do much anything specific. But I can understand your consumerist attitude confusing “being given too many options” with freedom.</p>
<p>Capitalist economies foment an atmosphere of competition, where there are a couple of choices on what brand light you want to come from your lamps. It is true that if the government makes light bulbs and nobody else does, you won’t have many options as to what brand you’ll buy. The words <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Government Light</span></span> might replace all those little stamps that say <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">General Electric</span></span>, and… and, um… well there must be some other light-bulb company out there that you value as an option.</p>
<p>But I’m also guessing the Government Light factory will be able to make them cheaper, and with just as many useful varieties. Government lightbulbs may not look like this:</p>
<p><span alt="" class="broken-image" title="This image is broken"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-unlink svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#unlink"></use></svg></span></p>
<p>but with the need for clear and efficient lighting in place you’ll be able to flick-up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Incandescent_and_fluorescent_light_bulbs.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">your old friends</a>.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>bigger government doesn’t mean better living.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>nor does the existence of more companies. Nor does bigger government mean worse living. In fact I’ll argue that there’s an asymptotic negative correlation between number of brands and quality of life.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? With a hundred thousand different producers and distributors of soda, good luck finding a Dr. Pepper when you want one. Odds are there’s only one place in town that has ties with the company to sell it.</p>
<p>And if you’re stranded in rural Arkansas? Forget it… they won’t have heard of such chemistry. You’ll have to settle for the local brands which offer a salted-barley brew. Because the people who grew up there have learned to love the stuff.</p>
<p>Being able to obtain Dr. Pepper in Tokyo, to you, seems like a good thing, I can tell. It’s globalization, after all. It’s an example of significant commercial exchange. But it’s also an example of why <span class="bbcode-b">big government</span> is ultimately good. If we put the world under one democratic rule, you’d be able to vacation in the Maldives without a fat passport. Break your ankle while water-skiing, and you’ll have a much better chance of getting medical treatment the same as if you would back home. And finding <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Cuba Cola</span></span>, equally likely.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart, and their in-house <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Great Value</span></span> brand, are calmly and bravely approaching the fringe of socialism. It cleanses my spirit to see those cans of beans, with their white labels, saying only <span class="bbcode-i">Red Beans (Frijoles rojos)</span> on them, with a quick picture to represent them.</p>

            <p>again, what does the government “trying to limit people on their cigarettes” have to do with socialism?</p>
<p>I’m genuinely curious because i think it hints at a “unique” definition of socialism that may only have a tangential relationship to the dictionary definition. But who knows, maybe I’m just missing something. Clue me in?</p>

Your generalizing amuses me. Nearly every country in Europe has its own healthcare system. They all work better than what you have now in the US.</p>

            <p>Since we were talking about Obama being a socialist and shit, check this out - CNN has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/04/14/Obama.socialist/index.html?hpt=C2" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">one of the best articles I’ve ever seen</a> in corporate media on this subject.</p>

 CNN:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Obama’s opponents have long described him as a socialist. But what do actual socialists think about Obama? Not much, says Wharton.</p>
<p>He and others say the assertion that Obama is a socialist is absurd.</p>
<p>“It makes no rational sense. It clearly means that people don’t understand what socialism is.”</p>
<p>Definitions of socialism vary, but most socialists believe workers and consumers who are affected by economic institutions should own or control them.</p>
<p>Not all socialists, though, want to confiscate personal property. Democratic Socialists are more interested in protecting ordinary people from unregulated capitalism through regulation and progressive taxation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Over-inflated self importance. The world does not NEED America. Central America runs off drugs, losing US finacial support would weaken the governments, not the countries. Russia, (I notice you forgot) China, Europe, Saudi Arabia and even India have decent economies; if America went under all that wealth would just be redistributed.</p>
<p>If America suddenly collapsed we’d be facing a lot less Western bias in the world.</p>
