    <title>A little issue in the main portal in Lambda Core.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-little-issue-in-the-main-portal-in-lambda-core/15082</link>
    <description>This is what I find in the gameplay, maybe no one has noticed this.
That is in the main portal, when the portal first appears, there is an effort come with it, just look at the picture below.
![20170129223605_1.jpg|690x500](upload://wcbM4MZXVUuY6u7ubNkvWzN4Nnh.jpeg)
There is something around the portal, maybe the sending out energy, you can see. That is what developers want to show us.

Now the problem is: When you first enter this area. Yes, here &#39;&#39;first&#39;&#39; means such as playing the whole chapter from the beginning or starting at the former map, not reloading the saved game or restarting the loading game.

And this effort will not appear normally, like the picture below.

Now there is nothing around the portal.

I have play this part for several times to avoid the accident, and if you reload the game here, this will run normally everytime.

These two pictures is made by the same time the instant that the main portal appears, the former one is in the first playing of this chapter, then the next one is in the reloading game after.

I think there must be something wrong with the effort trigger. Hope developers can confirm this and fix it sometime in the future, thanks a lot!</description>

<p>Okay, i noticed it just now.</p>
<p>I believe that’s a part of the animation for the portal creating.</p>
<p>Now your explanation was a bit rough, so i as understood, in one gameplay they appear,<br>
but in another one they didn’t?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, for example: You start a gameplay from the beginning of this map bm_c3a2h. When you first get this area, they didn’t appear. But if you load the saved game here, they did. I guess this animation only runs normally in the restarted game, in the normal gameplay it won’t.</p>
<p>I hope someone else can confirm this, maybe it’s my own problem.</p>

</aside>
<p>No sir, I was been attacking by the controller when I was printing the screenshots, those tiny dark coloured shards are blood. I mean the other tiny blue things around the portal, like the stars. You can click to enlarge the picture.</p>
