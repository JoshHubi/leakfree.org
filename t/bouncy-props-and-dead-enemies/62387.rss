    <title>Bouncy props and dead enemies;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bouncy-props-and-dead-enemies/62387</link>
    <description>So I was playing around in Lambda core for a while and after a while this started to happen LOL

Props and dead enemies will fly through walls (including when I die I fall through the map), and the props will bounce around the floor? Reported in discord also.

Here is videos showing it happening.

Some of the code in console ...

After restarting my game (pc) it appears to have fixed itself. I could replicate the bug with the game still open and reloading saves but now its gone.</description>
