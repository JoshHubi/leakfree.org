    <title>Game Design Degrees</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-design-degrees/5384</link>
    <description>Hi,

I tried searching and didn&#39;t see any threads relating to this topic and also I couldn&#39;t think of any other better place to post this. I wanted to ask any of the members on this forum if they are going, or have gone, to school for a game design degree. I know there are a few schools throughout the country that offer this and I was wondering if it&#39;s worth the time and money, and if it was easy to get a job in the field after graduating. I don&#39;t know if this matters but I&#39;d want my primary focus to be the art side of developing. I will be transferring to a new school in the Fall semester of next year and I need to choose a degree. Any information I get can would be great.

Thanks.</description>

<p>As has been said already; nothing bad can come of the extra education, only good. As well as the training in your desired field it will inevitably allow you to make many connections with others either in the industry or at least who have a similar passion to yourself.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I got in contact with an employee, who is a modeler, awhile back at Rockstar. He gave me some pretty good advice. He said kind of what everyone else has been saying, and gave me a good idea of ways of getting hired. His main points were that, you can be a talented artist just leaving high-school, or you can be a terrible artist with a degree, which one do you think a company would hire? And also the idea of creating a really nice portfolio as everyone else has been saying. Definitely gave me something to think about.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You really don’t need an education to learn game related stuff, unless you plan on becoming a programmer then stuff like maths are important.</p>
<p>I learned modeling, unwrapping, texturing, animation, level design and more myself using internet courses and tutorials. Recently I’ve started working with the Source engine and ZBrush (also worked with Call of Duty, CryEngine, UDK, CoH worldbuilder, QED Sudden Strike and more). Thanks to the huge amounts of tutorials for Source it was a piece of cake and I’m already halfway through releasing my first map. Currently I’m 18, working on a commercial project with a friend on a new game engine he built.</p>
<p>What I’m saying here is that education is not a ‘must have’, I can only give you my personal opinion, but I wouldn’t waste the time nor money.</p>
<p>Rabidmonkey suggested you take a different course, I agree with this.<br>
Learning stuff that requires more brains (programming) is also recommended, or at least the basics so you know how a game engine works. While you do that you can learn everything you need for game design and start working on projects whether they’re commercial or not.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>As for problems, you don’t need to refer to a manual. Software such as 3ds Max and Maya are so popular by now there’s always someone who had this problem, or just look up a tutorial.</p>

<p>I’m not saying game design degrees are useless, they certainly are not. I’m simply saying that you shouldn’t put all your faith in it.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the greatest problem with this is that. While yes learning the software is a must. It’s usually not as clear where to start. I guess I’ve always felt that going to school for this sort of thing not only would show you how to use the programs but what sort of things to look for. Most of what I’m talking about relates to modeling. While the internet may be great for finding tutorials or other things on specific topics. I’ve often found it harder to find more general articles. I’d even go as far to say that the manuals for the software sometimes have this same problem.</p>

<p>Garth, out of curiosity. I know you said before you didn’t have a particular part of what you’d like to focus on for game design. But what part are you most interested in? Like for example, I said before I really want to do the art side. Are you thinking more of like level design, project management, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, I’d say level design as that is where I really feel concepts and ideas truly come to life. But I’d also really like to know coding as, at least in the community, that seems like the most needed skill, and level design the least. Also, I’d be able to make apps for mobile devices in my free time. Perhaps professionally I could learn level design and then as a hobby learn to code for mobile devices. Or maybe all this is an ungrounded dream and I’ll end up flipping burgers in McDonalds.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>From what I understand a whole lot of the quality mods are made by college students such as rabidmonkey. Also, Valve has a habit of picking up on cool college projects and hiring their creators. That said, I agree with you, to have the best chance, it’d be best to start working on your own as soon as possible and perhaps continue learning at a college.</p>

            <p>Most people working at (large) game studios are modders, just saying. You name it, Valve, Infinity Ward, Treyarch etc. People who work their ass off by learning all the software needed to create games, mastering them and creating awesome work that will blow other peoples minds.</p>
<p>I’m not saying game design degrees are useless, they certainly are not. I’m simply saying that you shouldn’t put all your faith in it. A lot of modders have started working with games at a very young age, and their portfolio will totally dominate yours if you’re not going to do what it takes besides following some game design education to learn how to use certain software.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys this really helps. I am sort of in limbo right now with choosing a degree, but if the case is just teaching myself. Well, that saves me a lot of money. Have either of you come across any training DVD’s or something similar which you would absolutely recommend to anyone? I usually check out the tutorials on cgcookie. I’m using blender just as a basis to become accustomed to modeling in general. From everything that I’ve seen so far the tools are basically the same between other modeling programs. I’m not sure if it’s still open but I posted a thread some time ago of some stuff I was working on. I may start posting in there again, so if you have some spare time maybe you can take a look once I get started up again.</p>

<p>All the software developers I really look up to and respect took university courses that had nothing to do with software development. They learned the stuff on their own time, and <span class="bbcode-i">preferred</span> learning it that way. There’s good reason, too. In this field, there’s a lot of learning by doing, and you don’t stop learning when you leave school. Sure, there’s the initial curve (F*cking Threads, How Do They Work?), but after that you can expect to be gradually accumulating knowledge for eternity.<br>
(Or your death; whichever comes first. If you’re younger than me, expect the former. Sorry about that).</p>
<p>Humanities, physics, math, cellular biology, geology… all good fields. The important thing is they’ll <span class="bbcode-i">inspire</span> you, making anything you do with game development (or software in general) much richer.</p>
<p>Having a degree is pretty important, though. It says that you can stick with something, which the people doing hiring really love to see. A good school can help you get your foot in the door.</p>

<p>I doubt anybody who has replied to you in this thread has ever worked in the videogame industry… so don’t put too much faith in them. I’m currently attending the video game development program at Algonquin college. Most of my teachers have worked or are working in the game industry, so you are being taught from people who actually know what they are talking about. I highly suggest you think about getting an education from professionals rather then try and learn everything on your own, they will teach you from the ground up a bunch of different programing languages like C++, Java, OpenGL, DirectX, Action Script and Lingo. They teach you animation, modeling, sound design and much much more. And the best part about them being in the industry is that they know all the little tricks and are current in the most recent technology. Our final project of the year will be to design and produce a video game for a next gen console like the 360 or ps3. so seriously… get an education, peopled who graduate in game development are in high demand for their specialized education. Its worth the money and your practically guaranteed a job after</p>

I’m attending a game college at the moment and I would definitely recommend getting a formal education instead of trying to learn it all yourself and working on mods which will probably never see daylight. I mean sure, the courses are expensive as anything, but the advantage of having a structured  environment and knowledgeable teachers sure sounds better than clicking through endless tutorials. My current teacher was a recent developer on L.A. Noire and having him around to ask questions about how to do something beats having to post on a forum to ask questions any day. In our 2nd year, we collaborate with the programmers in small teams to make an actual working game, complete with milestones, deadlines and team communication. And obviously a potential employer is looking for outstanding showreels, they don’t give two shits about a certificate or degree. So I would recommend doing the course over learning it yourself.</p>

            <p>Garth, out of curiosity. I know you said before you didn’t have a particular part of what you’d like to focus on for game design. But what part are you most interested in? Like for example, I said before I really want to do the art side. Are you thinking more of like level design, project management, etc.</p>

<p>That’s not at all what I expect. I’d get a degree in game design not only because it’d look good on a job application, but more so because it would help me learn game design.</p>

            <p>I would tell you of some databases but unfortunately they’re only for Illinois. Just google for a little bit I’m sure you can find some college databases that should have everything organized by their programs.</p>
