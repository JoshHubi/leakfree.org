    <title>Crash: bm_c1a2a</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-bm-c1a2a/10140</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I would just like to report a game crash I am experiencing on &#39;bm_c1a2a&#39;.

Just after exiting the elevator you have the electricity killing the head crabs on the left and the two scientists on the right behind a red door.

After proceeding out of the lift you wait for the electricity to blow out the duct vent. Upon entering the duct as soon as I move either down or up the duct game crashes without warning.

I have tried to replace the files for Black Mesa as well as download a entire new copy with no success.

Attached is the mini dump file.

Appreciate any input.

<p>EDIT: I’ve tried to ‘Changelevel’ skip this section, however I get missing doors, people, machines, basically its random every time.</p>

            <p>Just as a heads up on this, and it might not be related.  But every time I turn on my flash light in that same place the game crashes.  It kept crashing on the elevator right down while I had the flash light already on.  I only was able to get into the level with the flash light off, and so far I’ve had to keep it off or the game crashes on me.</p>
