    <title>Screwing around with the gravity</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/screwing-around-with-the-gravity/10633</link>
    <description>Does anyone know how to fuck around with the game&#39;s gravity so that it affects gibs, environmental props, and projectiles? Sv_gravity only changes the gravity on my jumping. Is there a specific console command for this kind of thing?</description>
