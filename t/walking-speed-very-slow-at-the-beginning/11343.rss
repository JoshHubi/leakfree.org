    <title>Walking speed VERY slow at the beginning</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/walking-speed-very-slow-at-the-beginning/11343</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

I have a weird issue, after inbound (EDIT actually it happens right from the start, in the train...), just when the tram stops and the security guard comes, when I try to move, [b]I move very slowly, like pixel by pixel!... [/b]

I tried to uninstall steam/source/BMS etc, clean and reinstall, no effect, followed instruction for the windows update, no result.

Anyone experienced something similar??!! Any idea?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Exactly, as if my speed was 10 or 50 times slower.</p>

<p>OK Got the answer… What a retard I am…</p>
<p>I was using a software called HoldKey, which allows to type accented characters. This works by holding the up arrow key, which then prompts a clickable multiple choice accented character list. However I forgot about it, and it does not work/happen when in game, but since the process runs in the background, holding the walk key was messing up the system…</p>
<p>Configuring another key for walking was working but just not manageable, brain stubbornly wired to do the same since 20 years I guess…</p>
<p>Anyway problem solved!</p>

            <p>Yes, it is just me, the guard is moving as expected. I tried to edit the autoexec file as you explained, but to no avail…</p>
<p>thanks for the input anyway!</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">If it is only you, who’s moving “pixel by pixel” and not the guard (or any other NPC), try this:</span></p>
<ol type="1">
<li> Browse to this location: ‘<span class="bbcode-b">\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\cfg</span>’</li>
<li> Locate the file ‘<span class="bbcode-b">autoexec.cfg</span>’ and open it with a text-editor (Notepad++ or anything similiar [preferably with line-counting])</li>
<li> Copy the line from the Code-Box below, and paste it underneath the existing lines inside the file (there’s also an example below, showing what the autoexec.cfg looks like after adding said line), then save and close the file.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Add this to the autoexec.cfg file:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sv_maxspeed "320"</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is an example of an edited file:</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">exec config.cfg
//exec threading.cfg

sv_maxspeed "320"</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
