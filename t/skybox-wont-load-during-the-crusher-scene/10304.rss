    <title>Skybox won&#39;t load during the &quot;Crusher&quot; scene</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/skybox-wont-load-during-the-crusher-scene/10304</link>
    <description>In the hangar area (first encounter with assassins) and the following scene where you escape the garbage crusher, there was no skybox. Black sky instead. Skybox reappeared after the next loading.

Anyone else encountered this?</description>
