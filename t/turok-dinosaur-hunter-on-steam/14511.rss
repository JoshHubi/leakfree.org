    <title>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter on Steam</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/turok-dinosaur-hunter-on-steam/14511</link>
    <description>My jaw hit the floor this morning when I saw this scroll through my steam store. Engine has been updated, I&#39;m just about to launch this thing and super stoked about it. Anyone else here remember Turok?

            <p>It is pretty expensive, I was suprised when I saw how much they were asking.</p>
<p>All the same though, I’ve been having a blast playing it, I tried an emulator version a while ago and was pretty dissapointed, I think this is like half life 2 update though, where it plays like I REMEMBER it, rather than like how it actually was, which is to say, a lot more crappy than I remember.</p>

            <p>Night Dive Studios have been doing nice work reviving old classics like System Shock and now this.</p>
<p>That said, Turok remastered on Steam is a bit too expensive for my taste.</p>
