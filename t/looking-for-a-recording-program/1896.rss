    <title>Looking for a recording program?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-a-recording-program/1896</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m looking for a good recording program that can record guitar plugged from my amp into the PC and maybe handle computer drums put over the top, I&#39;m downloading Adobe Audition at the moment, just wondering if anyone had any suggestions?

EDIT: Found a drum program named Hydrogen, no idea how to insert the beats into Audition though :x</description>

<p>Audition is good (used to be CoolEdit 2000), and does multichannel, so I’d imaging exporting the output of the beats as wave files then importing them into Audition would work fine.<br>
Quality will in the end depend on your sound card too tho.</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve got a pretty new Soundblaster card for my 5.1 surround sound speakers. Tried it out last night, pretty awesome and will get what I need to do done.</p>
<p>Thanks guys.</p>

            <p>For just recording, audacity is pretty good. It’s free (legally) and isn’t bloated.</p>
