Think a Jurassic Park title from Telltale Games is exciting? How about a full episodic season of games based on Back to the Future, due out this winter? Whoa, this is heavy.

Game Informer may have outed Telltale&#39;s trip to Jurassic Park, but that&#39;s only half of the story. Through a new, multi-year agreement with Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing, Telltale has secured the rights to make games based on both Jurassic Park and Back to the Future.

Perhaps through some sort of clever time manipulation, an episodic season of Back to the Future games will be the first fruit of the partnership, coming this winter to multiple gaming platforms. The Jurassic Park games will follow soon after.

&quot;Our partnership with Universal is an exciting next step in our continued growth as a mass-market games publisher and developer,&quot; said Dan Connors, CEO of Telltale Games. &quot;We are all huge fans of both of these franchises. For Back to the Future and Jurassic Park, we will leverage Telltale&#39;s expertise in story-telling and game design to deliver on the unique elements of each series, with our goal being to create compelling cinematic adventures paying homage to each franchise.&quot;

Telltale will release more details on both game series at a later date. For now, I&#39;d safe it&#39;s safe to say time travel and dinosaurs will be involved.

            <p>I recall playing an old JP game, though my memory is rather hazy… It was an RTS or RPG (of RTS control-scheme)… Anyone have any idea what it is I might have played? I only had a demo and really want to play it again (for some reason)… Think it was back on Win98. Anyone?</p>
