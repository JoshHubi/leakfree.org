    <title>Half-Life Server/Port Fowarding</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-server-port-fowarding/1374</link>
    <description>Need a bit of help here... I&#39;m trying to allow myself to start up a Listen server for a Half-Life mod. Usually when I start a game it&#39;s forcibly set to LAN and friends can&#39;t see it in the browser etc.

I am aware of the need to Port Forward but before I try that (it looks time consuming), I was wondering if anyone of you have needed to do the same thing and if you have any tips/suggestions of easier ways to achieve my goal (setting up a simple server).

Notes:
- Have tried sv_lan 0
- Using a Netgear CG814WG wireless router

Sorry if this seems noobish, I&#39;ve just never tried anything like this before. The mod is Sven Co-op if anyone&#39;s wondering. I&#39;m sick of the XP mods/lack of maps on the dedicated servers.</description>

            <p>Not to bump a really old thread, but I thought it better than starting a whole 'nother thread.</p>
<p>So yes, I am having the same problems Sky Monster had. Numerous websites have info about how to create a server, yet for me it is to no avail. I still create servers that are LAN. I know about port forwarding, and I have ported the required ports(or at least according to the tutorial here <a href="https://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Guides.Detail&amp;id=4&amp;game=3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> which also linked to <a href="https://www.portforward.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>) and still like I said it is not working.</p>
<p>I’ve looked for help on numerous other sites, to no avail. So I ask here, knowing there must be SOMEone who knows.</p>
<p>Oh, and other info:<br>
I’m trying to make a half-life 2 DM server.<br>
My router is a Linksys WRT54GS.</p>
