    <description>Has anyone played the old Half-Life 1 mod Zombie Panic? I used to, but now the mod is dead apparently.  I wish people still played, the Zombie Panic Source mod doesn&#39;t seem to have the same appeal to it that the old goldsrc mod had.</description>

            <p>I remember people glitching the door by shoving a closet into it and then closing it on the farm map. I used to laugh when the door exploded and the closet flew into those glitchers and killed them.</p>

<p>It’s loads of fun, and it probably has the most active community of any<br>
multiplayer source mod.</p>
<p>There are loads of servers and scares, it’s definitely a way to spend a weekend night. Seriously, I got a headset just to play it; the game’s teamwork is just so damn necessary that it really feels like you’re relying on other people to live. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Just remember, if you want to be human; spam f1 at the round start.<br>
If you want to start as a zombie, then you want to spam f2.<br>
If you die you become zombie. If you carry too many weapons, you will move very slow.<br>
Macro the panic button to a close key, so you can drop all items and sprint away when in danger.<br>
When in doubt, barricade the door – it’s basically a necessity.<br>
And finally, never go Rambo, that shit almost never works.</p>

<p>So were you one of those people who would sit back and let the team do all the hard work, or was that just a last minute survival strategy because you only had the two rounds?</p>

<p>Usually there were people in the rooms with me. But the time I am recalling is when everyone stood at the barricade firing and I hid because I knew they were going to be overrun in like 4 seconds. It was near the end and I was right about their demise. So it was quick survival thinking <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I ended up killing myself with a nade just so they wouldn’t have the pleasure of killing me, because they were getting in. It was funny…</p>
