    <title>The REAL (real life) Black Mesa Facility...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-real-real-life-black-mesa-facility/3943</link>
    <description>we all know that there&#39;s a real black mesa facility in new mexico and that it was a nuclear missile development and test facility... but wikipedia doesn&#39;t say much about the real BM facility... so i wonder is it still top secret? if not, is it possible to visit it? if so, did anybody stay there for a visit? or is there somewhere more information about the facility? because google doesn&#39;t find very much about that real thing... it would be really interesting to know more about the real facility...</description>

            <p>Muhb, I’ve actually been there. There IS a cave in there, that is pretty ominous, but alas, no secret facilities. I never would’ve thought to connect the two.</p>

            <p>lol, there are countless of places like that in the world. ridden with rumors and folklore.</p>
<p>As a kid I used to go visit an abandoned house. It had old electrical wiring from like early 1900s and the house was full of old items and cobwebs. It was very spooky. The house was eventually used as training site for firemen (they set it on fire and let firemen put out the fire). You can’t even see a trace of it today.</p>
<p>It is nice to have an imagination. Just don’t let it control you.</p>

            <p>the inspiration for the original half life came from what “happened” during the montauk project.</p>
<p>scientists where experimenting with something, they opened a door to the “4th dimension” and a creature came out and killed everyone in the room.</p>

<p>@ MechUnit:  Although it was pointed out already that the Black Mesa from Half-Life (at least the name) was actually thought up in a completely independent brainstorming process, I thought I’d provide some context, if you were curious (unless you’re already aware, in which case… disregard… :zip <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  The scan of the brainstorming notes that xilef posted were actually from a book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Half-Life-2-Raising-David-Hodgson/dp/0761543643/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar</span></a>, and is accompanied by this text:</p>
<p>[code]Science fiction author Marc Laidlaw joined Valve in the<br>
summer of 1997. Presented are Marc’s brainstorming<br>
notes on the name of the research facility eventually<br>
dubbed, “Black Mesa.”</p>
<p>“It’s great fun to invent names for our creations, and then<br>
see them go out into the world and take on lives of their<br>
own. But I am very glad that I decided to go with ‘Black<br>
Mesa Research Facility’ rather than ‘Black Butte.’”</p>
<ul>
<li>Marc Laidlaw[/code]</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as the actual construction and design of the facility is concerned, I’m pretty sure it was based more on science fiction novels and/or places like Area 51, than anything else.  Half-Life’s Black Mesa doesn’t really have a single, definitive, real-life physical counterpart… if nothing else, it’s a culmination of a bunch of different real-life facilities or places, with a lot of extrapolation and imagination (and stickygibs) gluing it all together. :3</p>

<p>Said the guy that completely ignored the scan of the brainstorm paper where they’re trying to come with decent names for a facility (I prefer Diablo Mesa tbh).</p>
<p>And in case you didn’t know: that paper indicates that they were just trying to come up with cool names.</p>

            <p>Having lived in New Mexico almost my whole life(and Los Alamos for a good 10 years), I’m pretty sure that White Sands Missile Range is the only thing similar and even then its a testing ground, not a giant research facility such as Los Alamos National Labs or Sandia National Laboratory.</p>

            <p>Black Mesa just a fictional facility by Valve, but what about Balck Meas? <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/open_mouth.png?v=9" title=":open_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":open_mouth:"></p>

            <p>I guarantee that the intended similarities between the real life BM and the HL BM is the name and generic rocket testing, that’s it.  I do not think Valve would have wasted the time investigating and researching the real BM facility (if even possible considering BM is a government, not public, facility) because, except for the individuals actually working there, no one would be able to confirm the differences between them.</p>

            <p>sorry for not satisfying you guys… but what <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">if</span></span> Valve did take the real facility for the game and enhanced it with their phantasy. and keep in mind that i’ve started this topic just to ask if someone would know more about that.</p>
<p>i believe that can’t be a coincidence that the ingame facility is named Black Mesa, too AND was a R&amp;D and testing facility for missiles, too. maybe Valve just knew about the existence of the real facilty and that it was a former missile base and the rest you see ingame just came from their minds.</p>
<p>and i’m sorry that my english is not to good so maybe it’s sometimes hard to get my point.</p>

            <p>Poor MechUnit. I thought that was very interesting. Of course its not Half Life’s Black Mesa but it does sound like the name was ripped off from it.</p>

</aside>
<p>i’ve got your point but i think it was valve’s idea to take THAT facility in the game and maybe they were there and took some photos for HL because maybe they’ve done some real places from there in the game? just my idea…</p>

            <p>Well that kind of silly, because firstly it’s a video game, and secondly there isn’t really a real world facility that’s comparable to BM in scope and size even if it were a real place. I’ll move this to the subforums for now.</p>
