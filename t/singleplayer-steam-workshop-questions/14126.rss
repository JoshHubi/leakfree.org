    <title>Singleplayer Steam Workshop Questions</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/singleplayer-steam-workshop-questions/14126</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve published a singleplayer map, but I have a couple questions here.

1. Is there any friendly way in Black Mesa itself for end-users to launch singleplayer maps?  The Workshop Addons menu doesn&#39;t have any buttons for launching the level.  Do they really have to enable and go to the console to launch a Workshop map?

2. How does one get to be in the &quot;Singleplayer&quot; subsection of the Steam Workshop?

Thanks.</description>

            <p>But I literally can’t find the option anywhere.  I’ve looked in all the tabs and Owner Controls and can’t find anything regarding Tags.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Yeah, I would have expected a tickbox as well, but I simply can’t find it anywhere.  It’s definitely not part of the P2 upload tool either.</p>
<p>There’s only one Workshop item in Singleplayer, and it’s not even a Singleplayer map.  There’s only one Multiplayer item as well, despite there being several MP maps… so either people are forgetting to do it, or they can’t find it. X)</p>

<p>You have to add it post publishing, iirc. Most people just post it and be done with it.</p>
<p>(I know because I’m that 1 MP cat’d map).</p>

<li>
<p>There is not one, yet, but we have one planned for a future update to the UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe you can do it in the settings for the workshop item, it’s a tickbox somewhere or other.</p>

            <p>I’d really appreciate it if someone “in the know” could answer these, please.  Especially the second point.</p>
