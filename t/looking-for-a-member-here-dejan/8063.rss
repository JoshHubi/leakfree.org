    <title>Looking for a member here: Dejan</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/looking-for-a-member-here-dejan/8063</link>
    <description>Hey Guys, 

I used to lurk here many years ago. I remember when the community project to create a theme song for the mod was released and people were making tunes and uploading them to that thread. I was extremely impressed with a particular user and the music he uploaded: Dejan S. I can&#39;t find that thread anymore and when i try to look for Dejan i can&#39;t find his account here. Anyone know what happend to him? Is there a way i can view the thread on creating a black mesa theme? 

I even notice he won the contest for creating the theme, which doesn&#39;t surprise me, his music was amazing, he could have been a great contender for composing  this music for the entire mod... 

Thanks guys</description>

            <p>Oh man, I forgot about Dejan. He submitted some pretty good music for that project back then. I almost forgot how many years I’ve wasted here.</p>

<p>Thanks man for the links. I notice a lot of those songs are pretty techno-y. I remember he uploaded quite a few songs to the Black mesa theme thread and they were all amazing and sounded like something Kelly Bailey himself made. There was a particular song “The Fourth Dimension” that sounded similar to the Doom 3 theme song…</p>

<p>I guess you could try sending him a message on YouTube, or Facebook. Maybe he still have it and will be willing to send it to you. If you do, let us know how he responded. I’m quite interested in hearing more of his music.<br>

<p>I did that too at first… This is driving me nuts. With the music as good of quality as he made, he HAS TO have some sort of site where he keeps a portfolio… This wasn’t some kid screwing around on fruity loops or garage band either. I would seriously put all of his songs on my ipod and listen to them when i’m out and about…</p>

            <p>I haven’t heard of him before, which means he hasn’t been around (at least under that username) for around 2 iterations of the forums. To find the thread, you’d need to use something like the wayback machine, because the forums crashed a couple times and all the data was lost. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but welcome back!</p>
