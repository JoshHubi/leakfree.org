    <title>Steam fucked my shit up</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-fucked-my-shit-up/6062</link>
    <description>Okay, so I reformatted my PC. I had my programs etc. reinstalled, I was adding my backups into steam again (I copy over steamapps, and just reinstall the games via the library).

So anyway it crashed when I was doing this. No problem, I thought I might have been pushing it abit too far with the parallel downloads and installs. So I shut my PC off for the night, thinking I&#39;d sort it in the morning. This morning, steam refused to start, it would say &quot;logging onto account xxx&quot;...then just disappear, the process just vanishes. So I reinstalled steam. On first run, I get this error;

[img]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4259709/steamerror1.jpg[/img]

subsequent runs, it updates, lets me get to loggin....but logging in it crashes with a generic windows error :mono:

This cycle repeats everytime I reinstall; first run, error, everything after that, login crash.

Anyone have any ideas what it could be? My shockwave plugin in Chrome has stopped working at the same time, so no youtube either :S</description>

<p>It automatically re-creates the directory on its own… I think, too tired to remember at the moment. Couldn’t hurt to create another directory though and see what happens.</p>
<p>What lead me to suspect that is that Siggs did that with the content it crashed after adding the folder and starting steam. Couple that with the new OS upgrade (I suspect XP to WIN 7)… chances are highly likely that’s it.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I brushed up on som’more of the material in the link I provided to the steam forums. Found this.</p>
<p>Essentially this guy was attempting to move from his old PC to MAC (I don’t know why) anyway, it’s a similar issue, 2 OS’ that are not compatible. This fixed the issue for him.</p>

<p>Ok I’m trying this now. At the moment I’m only copying GCF’s which are platform independent. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think for Source that’s<br>
source materials.gcf<br>
source models.gcf<br>
source sounds.gcf</p>
<p>for TF2 it’s<br>
team fortress 2 content.gcf<br>
team fortress 2 materials.gcf</p>
<p>DO NOT copy<br>
team fortress 2 client content.gcf<br>
sourceint.gcf<br>
winui.gcf</p>
<p>As these are platform dependent (contains code for windows only)</p>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong with these. I’m trying the process of copying from C:\My Programs\Steam\steamapps\ to Users\USERNAME\Documents\Steam Content</p>
<p>And if I’ve learnt anything from using GCF’s to backup, you start downloading the game, wait for it to get past preparing files, then it starts downloading. Tell it to pause, then quit steam. In steamapps or Steam Content folder some GCF’s will have appeared, you need to replace these. When you load up steam, it will verify the files, and download the remaining ones. This process works on windows, on the basis you don’t copy any windows only gcf’s it should download the mac equivilents.</p>

<p>Ok I tried it and it works!!</p>
<p>Extra info though:<br>
For TF2 you will need<br>
source 2007 materials.gcf<br>
source 2007 models.gcf<br>
source 2007 shared sounds.gcf</p>
<p>as well as just the source ones</p>
<p>also multiplayer ob binaries.gfc is another one not to copy as there is a mac variation (as with all binaries)</p>
<p>Works for TF2, when from 50MB/7865MB downloaded to 7700MB/7865MB downloaded. That’s a lot of download saved  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Should also work for Portal, I didn’t have Portal installed on my PC but I’m going to install it and try the same process.</p>

<p>In short; do this:<br>
Delete your steam client .gcfs inside of the old Steam Apps folder, then move the folder into your steam directory, everything should work fine after that… your SYSTEM won’t detect the installed games though as far as I’m aware. I could be wrong though.</p>
<p>Sourceinit.gcf &lt;-- Steam will download it automatically<br>
winui.gcf &lt;-- Steam will download it automatically<br>
If that doesn’t work, then delete the ClientRegistry.blob in your main steam folder. (I’d delete it just incase anyway)</p>
<p>Don’t do cross-OS file jigsawing for game cashes or else you’ll get the problem you have now. 9 times out of 10 you’ll get a coding error. Most games are exempt from this, but DRMs and other such that rely on WIN 7 or XP code  is not best to move, instead delete them and re-dl/install them.</p>
<p>An example of things like this is Crysis, which uses two different clients designed for 2 different OS clients.</p>
<p>DX10 client for DX10 machines (WIN 7/Vista)<br>
DX9 client for DX9 machines (XP/Vista)</p>
<p>One is extremely buggy on the other. It took Crytek a little while to get a stable client on both. Using hacked software to emulate a DX10 environment on XP machines aren’t reliable sometimes either, so that was another hurtle.</p>

            <p>If you think the SteamApps folder is the cause of the problem, just cut and paste it elsewhere on your hard drive and create a blank steamapps folder in place of it and see if it helps. If it doesn’t, try what I suggested above.</p>

            <p>Siggs - What’s your upgrade OS? I suspect that your Steam Apps folder may have an incompatibility with your current OS/Steam version install or a corrupt <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GCF" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">.GCF</a> file inside of your directory… hence causing the problem. (The latter is far less likely as it doesn’t interface with the Steam directly, at least most of them, the WinUI.gcf and SourceInit.gcf MAY interface)</p>
<p>– Windows 7 &amp; XP have two TOTALLY different Steam clients. As the code is vastly different, some of the mechanisms that run the games and logins may not be working properly with the client you have installed if it’s from a different version of the client. Read below.</p>
<p>Edit: After some research on the steam forums, and google… it seems <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1370360" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> is a very similar problem to the one you’re having. Delete the WinUI and SourceInt.gcf files and see if it works. If not, then you’re gonna need to do a manual install, and move all your custom content over (if any). run it overnight and when you go to work/school, it does wonders for the wait.<br>
… they’ll automatically re-download them.</p>

            <p>Don’t delete the Steamapps folder which contains your games, that shouldn’t be the cause of any issues. Did you try doing what I suggested thru msconfig? It sounds like something is interfering with Steam’s operation if a reinstall didn’t fix anything.</p>

<p>Edit: nevermind. I see your problem is that launching it it closes out.</p>
<p>How about safemode? Can you update or launch in safemode?</p>

<p>It was the problem one of the times, yes. It wouldn’t stop the video card working by any means, no, so atm I don’t have it installed. It’s a shame, I rely on it alot.</p>

<p>My <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">shockwave plugin</span></span> in Chrome has stopped working at the same time, so no youtube either :S</p>

<p>I believe we know this as “Flash” nowadays, since Adobe bought Macromedia and merged Flash and Shockwave… Or call it “Shockwave Flash”, it’s actual name. But please don’t call it Shockwave, that brings back bad memories.<br>
EDIT: Shockwave does exist, I just checked. But it’s not what YouTube uses, which is “Shockwave Flash”, so my point still stands.</p>

            <p>If you get another issue, disable everything (including antivirus software, ATI tray tools, etc.) but the necessary startup programs using msconfig, and see if you get any more problems. If not, add programs one by one back in the msconfig startup list to see which one of them is really causing the problem.</p>

            <p>hmm. Well latest DirectX and VCredist are already in, I know steam worked on the administrator account <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>I’m not getting any issues atm, if that’ll last I don’t know…</p>

            <p>Try ending services like system restore, updates, indexing or superfetch, install new directx, vcredist, dotnetfx, SP1 etc, maybe even do a disk check, system restore sucks but switching to another user account to use steam is not that bad. I am leaving the internet till tomorrow so good luck.</p>

            <p>Looking at the very first screenshot, access denied? Try to get more access to the steam directory using the <a href="https://www.blogsdna.com/2173/add-take-ownership-option-in-right-click-context-menu-of-windows-7.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">take ownership</a> mod, just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t help, try installing steam into another directory, preferably not Program Files.</p>
