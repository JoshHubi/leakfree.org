    <title>Episode 3 and Source 2 Inside of Source Filmmaker</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/episode-3-and-source-2-inside-of-source-filmmaker/9124</link>
    <description>So some references to an Alyx EP3 model and some other stuff outright referencing Source 2 inside of the SFM files was found:

[i][b]Line 49 (Alyx Model):[/b][/i]

def content():

returns a Path instance representing the %VCONTENT% path – path construction this way is super easy:
somePropPath = content() / ‘ep3/models/characters/alyx/maya/alyx_model.ma’

global _CONTENT

TOOLS = None def tools( engine=’Source 2′ ):
[/quote]
Seems like this is happening every couple of months.  Nothing to get too excited over but still interesting.  So if Source 2 stuff is inside of SFM, maybe they were working on some kind of trailer or other footage?  Yeah, I didn&#39;t think so either.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Talking out of my ass here, but what if this new version of Hammer is released upon the OFFICIAL announcement of Source 2? Bare with me, but in theory, perhaps Valve’s new version of Hammer will not only be a suite of easy-to-handle Source gamemakery tools, but also contain a full licensed version of the Source Engine as a whole, but with a environment that’s also meant to be user friendly.</p>
<p>Basically what I’m getting at is that maybe with the introduction of Source 2, Valve will no longer see it fit to release games on the dated Source engine anymore, thus, they open the floodgates to the masses to let them have at the original Source engine for as long as they want, no charge.</p>
<p>Again, ass-talking.</p>

            <p>The biggest thing that needs to be added is streaming so there are no loading times. I would even be happy if they didn’t really upgrade the graphics much at all (obviously they should make it with more modern techniques, but how the graphics look could stay the same) and should concentrate on other things like AI and physics. That swarm demo awhile ago was pretty cool and I hope that makes it in in some way.</p>
<p>DX11 would be cool but something’s telling me that with Valves latest infatuation with Linux and not liking Windows 8 that Source 2 will be entirely OpenGL, which I’ve heard it better in some ways anyway. But yeah, DX11 or OpenGL with streaming, maybe just slightly updated graphics and a focus on the AI, physics, and scale/number of enemies on screen maybe. That would be awesome.</p>

<p>So some references to an Alyx EP3 model and some other stuff outright referencing Source 2 inside of the SFM files was found:</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Line 76 (Source 2):</span></span></p>
<p>Seems like this is happening every couple of months.  Nothing to get too excited over but still interesting.  So if Source 2 stuff is inside of SFM, maybe they were working on some kind of trailer or other footage?  Yeah, I didn’t think so either.</p>

<p>Much like the glob files in alien swarm, this means nothing. Source will always be modular. there will never be a source2</p>

<p>I think we can assume that what’s been taking so long is actually Source 2.  They’re probably aiming for how great looking/playing HL2 was back in 2004.  And they were probably working on how to get it to run on average PC specs and generation 7  consoles.  Making an engine always takes the longest.  Yes, HL2’s story took a few years, but they definitely spent more time on the tech behind it.  Like physics, animation, HDR (though that didn’t release until EP1), etc.  If it isn’t a new engine, it’s definitely a heavily rewritten one.</p>
<p>Though, it does make me wonder, will all of the other games be updated to Source 2?  It’s happened in the past.  One game I know for sure will probably receive an update (probably not immediately) is TF2/DOTA 2.  They’re pretty much a service now to regular players.  So Valve will likely have to restructure those games.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Never assume anything. Valve does as valve does and gabe said the whole point of source is to not have major engine builds, simply incremental updates and feature revisions along the way. and HDR was released in lost coast, not EP1. the new engine, even the next gen will still be called “Source”. Even if they update the games to the new engine, the games assets remain the same. thats why the fan made HL2 update looks better that the valve update.</p>

<p>Isn’t Portal 2 running on 2012 now?  Or maybe, they just updated to the new Valve video (i.e. the one with the turning head).</p>
<p>I was also thinking, I hope whatever Source 2 is, we can finally get rid of loading screens.  They’re sort of becoming obsolete now.  I know, that can be a challenge, but still, nothing is quite as immersion breaking, as a good 'ol Valve loading screen am I right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As said earlier, source2 was the Episode 1 version of the engine. Although getting rid of the loading screens would be nice.</p>

<p>Portal 2 ones were the worst, because they weren’t even little bubbles with ‘Loading’ in them, keeping things going from your PoV. They were actual SCREENS, which really pissed me off.</p>

<p>Thinking back to Portal 2 where they allowed mappers such freedom that as a player, you think you just walked into a room when you infact have teleported into another room on other side of the map, or the same room, and could seamlessly walk around in endless circles in an impossible space without using the portal gun. I’m sure they wanted to take that idea further and incorporate dynamic loading of these spaces for the purpose of defeating those lousy loading screens…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, not really. The function isn’t really new and is just enhanced portalcode that was already used in Portal 1 (duh) to use variable portals without border particles. The absolute position of a room inside a map is irrelevant because you can have multiple unconnected rooms inside a map and connect them via simple teleport triggers that are even in the old source engine. Even without portals you can teleport players back and forth as you need.</p>

            <p>I hope future programs will make use of the excessive ram a lot of pcs now have. 8gb costs almost nothing and 16gb is just double the cost but still not really useful. With 16gb of ram you could load all the fucking game data into memory and won’t have any loading sequences apart from the inital load, which will take forever on hdds(sigh). With ssds everything would be better.</p>

            <p>Just gonna copy and paste my reply to the ValveTime Facebook post about this subject.</p>
<p>Chance McMichael — I know Half Life is the biggest thing on any Valve enthusiast’s mind, but thinking about Source 2… When Source came out, it was optimized thoroughly and, compared other games of the time, was incredibly beautiful. It didn’t rely on slabbing on post-processing effects and throwing shaders everywhere to deliver a crisp and vibrant image to the consumer, and I hope this trend carries over to this supposed “Source 2” which, if all goes well, will provide many enhancements over the Source engine such as improved polycount, texture resolution, shadowing, draw distance, seamless loading between maps, and much more, but also stick to the ideals that Valve created when making the original Source engine: That less is more.</p>
<p>TL;DR — Fuckshitcockballs Source 2 cool</p>
