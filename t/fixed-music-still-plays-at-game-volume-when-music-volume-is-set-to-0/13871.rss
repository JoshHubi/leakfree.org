    <title>[FIXED] Music still plays at Game volume when Music volume is set to 0</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-music-still-plays-at-game-volume-when-music-volume-is-set-to-0/13871</link>
    <description>I set my Music volume to 0 so I could listen to Spotify while playing (heresy, I know)

The blast pit music came on at full volume anyway (this was on the return trip from one of the areas, I think it was the power generator)</description>

            <p>Is it fixed in a way that means that music ambient_generics need to point to a different location, or is it handled programmatically behind-the-scenes?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>This would appear to be apparent in several other instances too. caused by a minor error in the file path for the music sound entities causing it too not recognise them as music but instead as generic audio.</p>
<p>Fixed for a future patch.</p>
