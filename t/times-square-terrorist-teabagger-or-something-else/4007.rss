    <title>Times Square.. Terrorist, teabagger or something else?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/times-square-terrorist-teabagger-or-something-else/4007</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m fairly sure you&#39;ve all heard of the failed attempt to detonate a badly crafted bomb on Times Square this weekend.

The Pakistani Taliban have claimed the attack, but there&#39;s no proof that they actually have anything to do with it.

The first video of the possible suspect shows a Caucasian male in his 40&#39;s, the license plate is from a car (or was at least, it was put on a junkyard) owned by a man living in the tri-state area of NY.

So, what do you think? Muslim extremist terrorist attack, or a crazed American that wants to fight against Obama&#39;s Communist/Muslim/Nigger reign? Or something else?


---
I&#39;ll be honest, when I heard there was a poorly crafted bomb found in a truck on Times Square, the first thing that came to [i]my[/i] mind, was that it was one of those Tea Party militia guys trying to make a point (or trying to fake a terrorist attack) so there would be food to attack Obama.

More reason for me to believe it wasn&#39;t a terrorist attack, is that it wasn&#39;t a suicide bomber. If it was a terrorist attack, the terrorist(s) would&#39;ve made sure that the bomb went off, by having the explosives on their body, with a direct trigger. This failed attempt was done by a &quot;coward&quot; that didn&#39;t want to die himself. Terrorists don&#39;t fear death.</description>

<p>The difference between them and AQ is that AQ wants to overthrow all Arab governments (presumably including the Taliban) and create one giant Sharia state in the middle east. Not exactly “global takeover” but a tall task nonetheless since AQ only had ~800 actual members at their peak strength in 2001, according to the CIA.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>AQ and the Taliban reached an ‘understanding’ during the 90s where, without any major political or ideological alignment, the two teamed up in Afghanistan. They didn’t really cooperate, they just didn’t try to kill each other. You’re dead right on AQ’s goals though; they pretty much advocate for a defence of the ummah (global Islamic community) against the West and their puppet governments (i.e. Saudi Arabia).</p>

<p>I thought the Taliban was all about reclaiming Afghanistan, not doing the world-wide global takeover shit that AQ seems to be hell bent on.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan is basically its own country, and  the Taliban are the “government” there (as well as most of Afghanistan). You’re right that it’s a nationalist movement, but it’s an Islamic nationalist movement - they are fighting for the imposition of Sharia law in the territory they control. The difference between them and AQ is that AQ wants to overthrow all Arab governments (presumably including the Taliban) and create one giant Sharia state in the middle east. Not exactly “global takeover” but a tall task nonetheless since AQ only had ~800 actual members at their peak strength in 2001, according to the CIA.</p>
<p>The Times Square terr’ist wasn’t even real Taliban as far as I can tell. According to his interrogators, he was a rich Pakistani kid who got pissed about airstrikes in Pakistan.</p>

            <p>We’ve gotten a touch off topic. As far as Al Quaeda and  that fun bunch go, I think their hatred is truly religiously based. They take passages from the Qu’ran that suit their beliefs, exclude others, and go kill people because of it. Most people do the opposite, excluding all passages that go against modern thinking and modern movements (less so in the Middle East), like things that have to do with discrimination and killing, and focus on the loving parts. Through this, you end up with a religion with two polarized areas, one who chooses to embrace the romantic side of religion (Jesus loves everyone, even non-Christians), and the other the violent side of religion (you will burn in Hell if you don’t believe).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except I suspect the reason they hate gays is basically religious.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Or they’re trying to deflect blame and/or garner support from the like-minded.  Some say* that Hitler** did not have religious motivations and was simply using  religion to try to make what he was doing seem right in the minds of his supporters.</p>
<p>My question becomes: How do you know that one’s motivations are religious or not?  I once argued, at length, with someone who swore up and down that the ONLY reason he didn’t want gays to have the same rights as the rest of Americans is that the Bible said it’s the right thing to do.  Finally, I got to the truth of the matter:</p>
<p>He didn’t like gays and found homosexuality disgusting.  He was using religion as an excuse, not a reason, as a way to remove responsibility.</p>
<p>The way I see it, if you hate gays, Americans, Christians, Muslims, or whatever else and you say it’s because of your religion, you’re only fooling yourself.  Otherwise, every religious person would feel the same exact way.  I see religion as being amoral, like a screwdriver or automobile.  It’s a great tool in the hands of the responsible and mature, but an irresponsible and immature person will use that tool to harm others.</p>
<p>The problem with religion, however, is that it makes a lot of otherwise responsible and mature people believe the excuse and get people on your side.  Murder is one thing and is harder to get people to side with you on–“I killed him because God told me to” is essentially the same as “My cat told me to do it”-- but it’s a lot easier to say “The Bible/Qur’an says it’s wrong so you shouldn’t have the same rights as others” even though neither says that.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I don’t think religion is a sole motivating factor, else everyone in that religion would be that way.</p>
<p>*Yes, I hate that term too<br>
**No, I’m not attempting to Godwin the thread.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually, he’s an American citizen.  He probably won’t be charged with treason but that doesn’t mean that he won’t be charged with all sorts of fun crimes that, if convicted, will put him away for a very, very long time.  It is extremely hard to be convicted of treason in the United States and no one since the late 1800s has been charged with it (though that’s not to say that the term is bandied about carelessly by too many).</p>

            <p>Unless, of course, they have other motivations and are simply blaming it on religion.  “I really hate gay people but I can’t say that I do, so when I killed that homo, I say I did it because God told me to.”</p>
<p>Is that a religious motivation?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FTFY</p>
<p>Nothing in the Qu’ran says to do what those on 9/11 did.  Unless, of course, you feel that abortion clinic bombings have religious motivation even though nothing in the Bible says to do that.</p>
<p>By the way, I’m a liberal and I don’t hate tea partiers.  I don’t know of a liberal that does.  I just question their motivation…and the name they chose.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not a question of whether or not the Qu’ran or the bible says so, it matters what they <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> it says. The same applies to the clinic bombings. If the perpetrator thinks the bible says to do it, its religious.</p>

<p>They say they’re against being overtaxed even though their taxes were probably cut by Obama and even for those that are getting their taxes raised are getting them raised to a far lower level than presidents like Reagan proposed.</p>
<p>It is my opinion that the Tea Party protesters (that’s what they call themselves…they also call themselves a sexual term which I won’t get into here) have no knowledge of history and are simply protesting it because a Democrat is doing it.</p>
