            <p>You guys all have huge e-peens and everything, but I figure if I change my password whenever I notice someone leeching, they’ll move along to a different network rather than taking the time to crack one that changes passwords every other day. It would be nice if I could monitor that without being plugged into my router, though.</p>

            <p>15 minutes is pretty long for a WEP key, I can do it manually in about 3, unless the signal is poor.</p>
<p>Even though all my neighbors have protection, I have the wep keys for 5 of them, even one WPA key that I figured out using my superior intelligence. (okay, it was just their phone number, but still)</p>
<p>It’s funny that I have the fastest internet connection around and my AP is the only one that’s totally unsecured, and I live on a kinda busy street corner and occasionally get leeched from. If you see sersoft2 listed, you’re getting dangerously close to my house.</p>
<p>A dick thing to do would be to simply disable DHCP, sure you have to enter your IP and DNS manually on every PC you use, but most people who steal wifi aren’t smart enough to figure this out and they will just think the signal is too poor.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>if you don’t like passwords and still want your SSiD visible to others (visiting relatives? PSP? Nintendo DS? etc.), simply take note of all your regular device’s MAC addies and set up a Wireless MAC filter so only identified nodes can talk with your router. This way you can avoid passwords and persistent hackers if you live in a large apartment complex.</p>
<p>That’s what i did.</p>

            <p>Because I need internets.<br>
Trying to manage a bunch of websites is hard without internet  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
First I see if the place I am staying at has internet, if not then I look for unsecured networks (One time I came across a 1mb/s unsecured network. Funnily enough, after exactly 1gb the speed dropped to 5kb/s). If there are none, then I begin cracking.<br>
I haven even taken the liberty of generating my own script to produce a list of hex combinations for WPA networks (As I think most people have moved away from plain 'ol words).</p>
<p>Anyway, If you want any other suggestions for securing your network ask away. I’m speaking from the POV of the person trying to gain access, so I can tell you what makes me sad.</p>
