    <description>Let&#39;s take Leisure Suit Larry for example:

Many people loved that adventure series, because of the puzzles and for its jokes. There were plans for a Larry 8 in 1998, but sadly it was canceled in the end (among many other well-known and successful adventure games like Space Quest 7).

I don&#39;t really now, why every gaming company thought, that the times for adventure games would be over. It really makes no sense to me, because it was a genre with huge success, even through the nineties were the beginning of the first 3D shooters.

But after some years, Sierra intended to revive their successful adventure games and released a new Larry game, named &quot;Magna Cum Laude&quot;.
But it wasn&#39;t Larry anymore, no adventure, but a collection of boring mini-games. As a result, they got bad reviews, bad sales and every true fan hated them from that on. So, what was the point?
And the worse, they didn&#39;t seem to learn from that lesson and released another &quot;piece of shit&quot;-sequel: Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust.

But Larry is just one example...there are many other game series, that got destroyed the same way.




Here is a list of common mistakes for a sequel:

1. Changing the genre or the tasks of a game (classic adventure -&gt; mini-games)

2. Writing a new plot, that doesn&#39;t pick up any events from the predecessor (even, if there was a cliffhanger)

3. Scrapping well-known characters, that appeared in every previous game of the series before (In the new Larry games, it is even the hero itself, who got replaced)

4. Hiring new voice-actors for well-known characters, who doesn&#39;t even have a similar voice.

5. Changing controls, even if it&#39;s not wanted, nor necessary (Point-n-Click is the only true movement for adventures games and there was no need to change that)

6. Changing the graphics model, even if it&#39;s not wanted, nor necessary (not every game needs real-time 3D graphics, while nice 2D pre-rendered backdrops are fitting perfectly for those kind of video games)

7. Eliminating elements, everybody loved in the previous games or replacing them with shit (subtle jokes for example)

I think there are much more things, they can do wrong.
The only question is why...why are they doing this?</description>

<p>You people do realize that like how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, “zombie” does not automatically equate to “undead” and as such you can have Living Zombies. Zombie is the state of acting without conscious control of your actions, which can refer to the animation of a corpse like a puppet; whether by stimulating the nervous system directly at the brain stem, through a robotic skeletal structure manipulating the limbs of the corpse, or through “magic”, or can also refer to the external control of a living person’s mind, whether through hypnotism, parasites, or “magic”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, RE4 and RE5 plagas can be considered zombies, like I said. However, if you didn’t know they were being controlled, they could also appear to be bat shit crazy cultists. When a guy with a pitchfork tries to kill you, you would probably think “Holy shit! This guys fucking insane!”, when you see a smelly man with flesh hanging off eating a corpse you might think “Holy shit! A fucking zombie.” So, the plagas of the new RE games are rectangles that look like triangles. Wait, what?:retard:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I do agree with this for the most part, would you feel the same way if Black Mesa was released and the devs made it a Halo clone because that was THIER definition of “better”. Of course Black Mesa is a bad example because it is a remake of a game that is already out, so, the “you should make it exactly like HL1, so don’t change anything, just make it BETTER” statement is pretty close to what they should be doing, they have to change some things, but the gameplay should stay the same.</p>

<p>I liked the change<br>
It’s like the shift in the Metal Gear gameplay.  Unusual, but progressive.<br>
Sure, the old system was excellent, but the new system allows for a better paced story line, and a lesser guarantee of sequence breaking.  (Which… it’s very easy to beat the first one in 1.5 hours, good for a quick distraction)<br>
I like the old system, but the linearity was difficult to grasp without a guide, and if you didn’t have help, you would be out of ammo fast.  The new system coddles you more, but I don’t think it’s problematic at all.  Yeah though… they do use a genre change to aid it, survival/horror-action/survival, still a fun game</p>
<p>…and If you’ve never played Resident “Wiivel” 4, you’re missing out</p>

</aside>
<p>The new ones are good games, no doubt. But they are not even the same type of game. Also, I found myself running out of ammo in the 5th one much more, for an action game ammo drops can be rare, and only 5 rounds, wtf, that’s like one kill. Not to mention Sheva burning through all my ammo, most of it into the back of my head. The game would have been much better without her. Think back to RE4, what were the worst parts of the game? Ashley, to put it simply. Sheva is like a permanent Ashley clone with a gun.</p>
<p>I might make a new thread for Resident Evil discussion, that would fall under technology and gaming right?</p>

<p>…and If you’ve never played Resident “Wiivel” 4, you’re missing out</p>

<p>It’s not that they’re not “zombies”, zombies are not real, so there really isn’t a fixed definition of a zombie. No, the behavior is quite diferent, the original zombies wanted to eat you and anything else alive to try, fruitlessly, to satisfy thier immense hunger. The plagas zombies are being controlled by a “mastermind” to do thier bidding and thus turns the plot into “Kill the baddy in charge” , which is cliche and, imo, stupid, rather than actual survival horror where your main objective is to escape alive.</p>

            <p>I could understand Capcom doing what they did if people were complianing about the old gameplay styles, but they weren’t, using the original gameplay mechanics still works even today. REmake and code veronica were huge hits, both of them some of the best on thier respective consoles. There was absolutely no need to change the gameplay AT ALL. I used to be proud to play the RE games, they were challanging and you had to think in order to survive and not many other kids (I was around 9 first time playing) played it, it was an elite game. Now any dumb fuck can play the games with ease. I’m sick of stupid people who think they know resident evil, yet haven’t even played one before 4.“What’s a Nemesis?” “Whose Barry?” “Zombies? Oh you mean Las Plagas!”:what::tired::mean:<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/rage.png?v=9" title=":rage:" class="emoji" alt=":rage:"><br>
I just needed to vent. Sorry. Been holding that in a while.</p>

I don’t get why they changed the series so much. It’s not like people were complaining or anything.IMO they changed them just for the sake of changing them. Fucking Sheva&gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Good news, according to the director or Capcom itself I can’t remember which RE5 will be the last of its kind.  Whatever that means for it I don’t know.</p>
<p>On Topic: It is a shame when a good series dies… (not necessarily Leisure Suit Larry, I never played it)</p>

            <p>I think Sega did this with a few titles…<br>
The 3D sonics (yay sonic 4!)<br>
Putting the Phantasy Star games into an online/MMO format<br>
Ruining Shining Force</p>
<p>…and meantime, where are games like Ristar and Vectorman?  What happened to ToeJam and Earl?  They haven’t done anything with Panzer Dragoon since 2002/2003, and there was only one Gunstar Heroes (the game that PROVED that awesome games could take 30 minutes to beat and still have high replay value)</p>
<p>If SEGA would get it’s shit together, they could easily get back into the business of consoles</p>

            <p>Here’s a fact everyone needs to get their heads around: Corporations for the most part are led by people who want to get money, not people who want to create beautiful gaming experiences. Those people are usually the devs. This is how the US at least, works, and the debate on whether or not this is good can go elsewhere. As such, it is not their fault they are doing what we should know they would do, it is the consumer’s fault for not holding them to a higher standard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bottom line: Almost any problem in gaming can be summarized in one word: Consumers.</p>
<p>Not greedy executives, not lazy devs, not annoying anti-piracy measures. Consumers.</p>
<p>They are the idiots who buy the worthless games, or don’t buy the actually good game. The average consumer is a total idiot with an IQ of about 3. Thats why much of gaming is going to hell.</p>
<p>That and casuals. Lots of casuals.</p>
<p>And by casuals I mean motion controls.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, greedy executives and their investors are also to blame.  Casuals, n00b-PwN1n’ H@x0rZ, sports nuts, Deus Ex fans, and everybody else could exist and be happy separately, but the executives want MAXIMUM PROFITS HUMANLY POSSIBLE, so they want to make games that will appeal to as many different people as they can.  They have mostly snuffed out any sort of niches in gaming, so games are more becoming the jack of all trades (Jack, who happens to also be the village idiot), but it isn’t very good at any of them.</p>
<p>They’re making sure games appeal JUST enough to anybody that they’ll be likely to buy it thinking it’s for them, when either the game is really designed for nobody, or for the dumbest, lowest common denominator.</p>
