    <title>Memory allocation failure</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/memory-allocation-failure/9562</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m in the third chapter (Kill the Scientists, something like this, sorry I can&#39;t remember the exact name). Got killed by a bunch of turrets, and the game crashed when reloading the last save:

Can&#39;t load lump 53, allocation of 14821501 bytes failed!!!


Of course, I have 8GB of RAM so that should be enough  :slight_smile: 
Hope you can fix it!</description>

            <p>I have also seen this issue a few times, as well as several game crashes with no message at all. It usually happens when the game is loading a new area.</p>
