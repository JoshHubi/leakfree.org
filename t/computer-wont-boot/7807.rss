    <title>Computer won&#39;t boot</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/computer-wont-boot/7807</link>
    <description>Alright, here&#39;s the deal; My computer is broken. It won&#39;t boot up properly, the fans go full blast, the HDD light stays on, and no signal goes to the monitor. It&#39;s been doing this since yesterday (Monday) and there have been no recent hardware installs, no driver updates, and the last thing I installed was OpenMPT, about a week ago with no ill effects. I have tried:
*Disconnect the power cord and hold the power button in for a minute to drain all stored electricity (multiple times)
*Take out and reinstall the GPU
*Do the same with the RAM, but run in between to check for beeps. (there were none)
*Take out and clean the Processor heatsink (might as well since I&#39;m digging around in there anyway)
*Yell at the computer for not working

My vital specs are:

AMD Athalon II dual-core processor (3.5 Ghz)
4GB Kingston RAM
Nvidia GeForce GTS250
Coolermaster Extreme 600W PSU

Any ideas?</description>

            <p>EDIT: Alright, the cause has been confirmed as PSU failure. I got my spare PSU out (the one that came with the case but wasn’t powerful enough for my GPU, and which I forgot about) and hooked it up, and sure enough, it ran. Going to have to go into town and get a new one, because literally nothing I use my personal computer for can run with integrated graphics. Anyway, thanks for all the help. (except the guy who posted about the non-existent ipad)</p>
<p>A cursory look at the manual for my motherboard reveals it does in fact have integrated graphics.  I guess I’ll give it a try.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just realized my brother’s old PC is lying around not being used. The PSU on that is probably more powerful than the one from the downstairs comp.</p>

            <p>even if your GPU doesn’t get enough power it should boot up (with reduced clock speed), you still need to have the 6pin molex connected to it though.</p>

            <p>Do you have onboard video just so you can test the computer with the other PSU?  If you do, you can just take your graphics card out for the time being and just see if you can boot.</p>

            <p>Alright, there is a computer downstairs with a PSU that will fit, I’ll see if it’s 450W or higher (450 is the minimum for my GPU) I also know a guy at school who took a comp eng course, and he thinks it might be the PSU, but he has to review his notes from last year.<br>
I really hope it is the PSU, because I really don’t want to have to install a new motherboard.<br>
EDIT: Nope, the basement computer’s PSU is 300W. Damn.</p>

<p>What you could try is either while the computer is starting up, wriggle the wires a bit, try a different screen for a conclusive result, or after turning on the computer, turn it off again, unplug it and leave it five minutes, this will let the RAM clear it’s cache.

</aside>
<p>It wouldnt have anything to do with screen, cable to the screen or the likes, as bios would still post regardless of a screen being connected or not, it doesn´t care about that.</p>

<p>This.  As someone else mentioned, you can also try removing/re-inserting the CMOS battery (or replacing it with a new one).  But the bottom line is, something is preventing your BIOS from even loading, which is either faulty power (bad PSU, loose power connections - make sure the 20/24 pin and 4/8 pin cables are secure on your motherboard), faulty BIOS or motherboard - either of those cases requires a swap of the mobo.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yup pretty much.</p>
<p>Please try a different PSU asap, with just one stick of ram, and integrated graphics if the mobo has any, and if not a gpu, all this outside of the case with nothing else connected to it, just to see if the mobo posts. As mentioned, for what its going to cost you, change the cmos battery.</p>
<p>If no luck, as it has been said, it´s either corrupted bios or bad mobo, either case unfortunately requiring a new mobo or RMA your current one if still under guarantee</p>

            <p>Maybe the bios is corrupt. That would explain the fans since the fan speed is controlled by the bios. It would also explain why his computer doesn’t post.</p>

            <p>Alright, here’s the deal; My computer is broken. It won’t boot up properly, the fans go full blast, the HDD light stays on, and no signal goes to the monitor. It’s been doing this since yesterday (Monday) and there have been no recent hardware installs, no driver updates, and the last thing I installed was OpenMPT, about a week ago with no ill effects. I have tried:<br>
*Disconnect the power cord and hold the power button in for a minute to drain all stored electricity (multiple times)<br>
*Take out and reinstall the GPU<br>
*Do the same with the RAM, but run in between to check for beeps. (there were none)<br>
*Take out and clean the Processor heatsink (might as well since I’m digging around in there anyway)<br>
*Yell at the computer for not working</p>
<p>My vital specs are:</p>
