    <title>Abrams tank sideskirt stretching.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/abrams-tank-sideskirt-stretching/11406</link>
    <description>This is a minor visual bug that I&#39;ve noticed on the Abrams. When the tank moves, some vertices appear to be stuck to the wheels and stretch with the wheel rotation, this happens on the left side as well. 

The model &amp; texture quality are set to max and this weird stretching still occurs.

            <p>I think there was also some instances of it firing on the player when the player wasn’t even in the same area, for example if the player avoids the tank and runs down the road towards where the LAV appears.</p>
