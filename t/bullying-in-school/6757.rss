    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlfokvjooZw&#39;]Casey Fights back a bully[/url]
This kid has probably been bullied for a big part of his life.
So what do you people think? 
How are you meant to deal with bullies?
Did Casey do the right thing?

Personally I say: &quot;Good goin&#39;.&quot; 
He was patient with his attacker before retaliating and even walked away after throwing him to floor. 
That takes some self control right there...</description>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m glad the bully got what was deserved, but kind of disgusted there was any punishment on his target. Anyone who says ill of him needs to come up with a suitable alternative to what he did in that situation. (I will come across as a flamer here, but that’s because I was a target of bullies my whole life. I’m also not directing this at anyone here, since most seem to support the victim in this thread)</p>
<p>A. Walk away and tell an adult.<br>
BAD IDEA. For starters, in many similar situations it is difficult or impossible for the target to walk away. Secondly, this makes you look like more of a weak target to the bully, and makes you more likely to be picked on later. To further that, it makes you look weak to anyone who happened to be watching, even if you’re really not. Third, in most cases the adult will either give a small punishment to the bully, or say that since they didn’t see it happening (what bully is going to act while visible?) and thus can’t do anything.</p>
<p>B. Ignore him. He just wants attention.<br>
Wrong. This is physical harassment, and for some people, actually harmful even when it’s something like poking. You can’t ignore someone who’s present at every event that composes your whole life at that age (classes, etc)</p>
<p>C. Attack him just enough to keep him away, but not enough to cause grievous injury him.<br>
WRONG WRONG WRONG. This is EXACTLY the sort of reaction a bully looks for. If he knows he can make you violent, exert some control over you, he’ll do it. Furthermore, obviously the school can only either condone or reject self-defense. Not say “You can do it, but only a little.”</p>
<p>The kid had no options. He was acting in self defense. He was being physically threatened, and the higher authorities were unable to defend him in that case. As for the ratty kid, he gave up his right to safety the moment he attacked someone. Much like if I ran out into the street and started hitting people with a crowbar, I wouldn’t really be able to protest or sue anyone just because the situation ends with me having six broken ribs and only one ear.</p>
<p>I don’t condone violence to solve problems like these, but as long as schools are so shitty that bullies can get away with these things, you can’t punish kids for defending themselves. I don’t think I would enjoy having security guards all around school, but they need to come up with something.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree. It’s a sad fact that the kids who get bullied often get in more trouble than the ones who bully, but I say if it’s nessesary to skip some school because your principal’s a fucktard and some asshole is causing grief, get on it, and don’t hold back.</p>

<p>You listen to Nikki Minaj. Your life is invalid.</p>
<p>Also, katana… You said you don’t condone a violent reaction to being bunched in the face? I’m not sure if you meant it, but that’s what I gathered.</p>

            <p>I’m glad the bully got what was deserved, but kind of disgusted there was any punishment on his target. Anyone who says ill of him needs to come up with a suitable alternative to what he did in that situation. (I will come across as a flamer here, but that’s because I was a target of bullies my whole life. I’m also not directing this at anyone here, since most seem to support the victim in this thread)</p>
<p>A. Walk away and tell an adult.<br>
BAD IDEA. For starters, in many similar situations it is difficult or impossible for the target to walk away. Secondly, this makes you look like more of a weak target to the bully, and makes you more likely to be picked on later. To further that, it makes you look weak to anyone who happened to be watching, even if you’re really not. Third, in most cases the adult will either give a small punishment to the bully, or say that since they didn’t see it happening (what bully is going to act while visible?) and thus can’t do anything.</p>
<p>B. Ignore him. He just wants attention.<br>
Wrong. This is physical harassment, and for some people, actually harmful even when it’s something like poking. You can’t ignore someone who’s present at every event that composes your whole life at that age (classes, etc)</p>
<p>C. Attack him just enough to keep him away, but not enough to cause grievous injury him.<br>
WRONG WRONG WRONG. This is EXACTLY the sort of reaction a bully looks for. If he knows he can make you violent, exert some control over you, he’ll do it. Furthermore, obviously the school can only either condone or reject self-defense. Not say “You can do it, but only a little.”</p>
<p>The kid had no options. He was acting in self defense. He was being physically threatened, and the higher authorities were unable to defend him in that case. As for the ratty kid, he gave up his right to safety the moment he attacked someone. Much like if I ran out into the street and started hitting people with a crowbar, I wouldn’t really be able to protest or sue anyone just because the situation ends with me having six broken ribs and only one ear.</p>
<p>I don’t condone violence to solve problems like these, but as long as schools are so shitty that bullies can get away with these things, you can’t punish kids for defending themselves. I don’t think I would enjoy having security guards all around school, but they need to come up with something.</p>

            <p>I think Casey did the right thing, by laying down the hurt on the little rat. Watching him limp off must have been supremely satisfying.</p>
