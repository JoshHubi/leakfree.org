    <title>BF3 team stacking</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bf3-team-stacking/8485</link>
    <description>Okay maybe this doesn&#39;t warrant it&#39;s own thread but whatever. Couldn&#39;t find the original BF3 thread so here&#39;s a new one.

Team stacking. WTF? I am currently on a 17 loss loss streak. That&#39;s pathetic. But the catch is, I&#39;ve been in the top three of my team in at least half the matches, excluding late joins, and on several of those matches I got MVP ribbons. I don&#39;t know why, but I end up on bad teams over and over and over. My W/L is .86 but i get countless mvp ribbons and often dominate matches. And if it weren&#39;t for my prolonged and failed attempt to play with 20fps, I&#39;d have an insanely good K/D too. So what&#39;s happening here? Is it just an unspoken rule that I&#39;ve missed that all good players should switch to the winning team? I server hop frequently, is that forcing me on to bad teams? Or is the game&#39;s system just fundamentally broken in some way that leads to significant team stacking that I&#39;m somehow on the losing end of? Da fuck is going on here? Help me out.</description>

We lost by 152 tickets. There were a lot of players doing worse, believe it or not, but they quit about mid game.</p>

            <p>If all you say is true, then the only answer I can come up with is that people tend to leave a game when their team is losing and so the only slots open in the game would be those on the losing team.</p>
<p>So whenever you join a game, you are put on the losing team automatically. Sometimes you can make a comeback, other times it’s a lost cause. The only “true thing” is to join a server that has open slots for both teams.</p>

<p>First you make a thread bitching about how you always lose in TF2; now you make a thread bitching about how you always lose in BF3. lern2videogames</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m trying to be less of a troll/douche on this forum, work with me here. And in the TF2 thread I never said I lose often, because I don’t, in TF2, I win frequently despite the turrets.</p>
<p>I mostly mad this int he hopes that I’d get some tips or something. Like should I stop server hoping? You guys can all dispute it as much as you want, but I am a pretty good player (in TF2 as well), and I have a frustrating large amount of losses. Yes I do play for the team, in Conquest I cap more flags in than anyone else, in rush, I clear out the mcoms from a distance so team mates can come in and I make “hero” arms/disarms at the last second, in tdm I rack up kills. I most often play medic and I get a lot of revives, and usually, when I revive someone, they actually get up and keep fighting, not die within seconds because they were right in the line of fire.</p>
<p>Yet despite all this I find myself losing matches a lot and not doing as well as I could have because my team isn’t providing the proper support. So, clearly, something I’m doing or not doing, other than my specific skill at the game, is making me end up on bad teams. Any help here? Anyone else have a similar experience? How do you avoid it? Do you just switch teams when you end up on the shitty team?</p>

            <p>Make sure your fighting for your team and not just yourself. Destroy vehicles, suppress and distract annoying choppers. This is a team game, mostly, not a lone-wolf thing.</p>
<p>Also, K/D doesn’t matter in Battlefield.</p>
