    <title>What xen creature would you keep as a pet?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-xen-creature-would-you-keep-as-a-pet/13526</link>
    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m curious about what xen creature you would like to keep as an pet?
Exuding Nihilanth, Gargantua, Tentacle, Gonarch, Alien Aircraft, Vortigaunt, Alien Controller and Combine becouse of either to big or to smart to be a pet

I would have had a Houndeye as a pet.
I just think they are really cute. The only problem i would see as having a houndeye as a pet is that if someone annoys or irritates the houndeye it would cause some problems with everyone around.

What would you have?</description>

            <p>On the topic of guard animals, I can’t think of a better trespasser deterrent than a Mr. Friendly.</p>
<p>But really, I’m gonna have to agree with Chicken here, a (preferably no longer) poisonous headcrab would be the best thing to have come crawling out from under your couch when you’ve got friends over. The best conversation starter is one that also sends your guests screaming to the nearest lockable door.</p>

            <p>A houndeye, or perhaps a chumtoad! Maybe both!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">   I’m pretty partial to houndeyes though. Plus if I could domesticate one, maybe it would protect me if I was attacked; whereas chumtoads seem fairly useless in that respect. XD  If I got attacked it’d probably just sit there, sticking out its tongue as usual…</p>

            <p>Well if mod creatures are allowed I’d probably go for a Frostsquid or Devilsquid, but if not then I’d go get a Bullsquid, name it something that starts with an X because all pets with names that start with X are cool, then I’d ride him to victory.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I’m curious about what xen creature you would like to keep as an pet?<br>
Exuding Nihilanth, Gargantua, Tentacle, Gonarch, Alien Aircraft, Vortigaunt, Alien Controller and Combine becouse of either to big or to smart to be a pet</p>
<p>I would have had a Houndeye as a pet.<br>
I just think they are really cute. The only problem i would see as having a houndeye as a pet is that if someone annoys or irritates the houndeye it would cause some problems with everyone around.</p>
<p>What would you have?</p>
