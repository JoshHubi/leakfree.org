    <title>What&#39;s wrong NOW!? (My PC broke)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/whats-wrong-now-my-pc-broke/9112</link>
    <description>My computer has always been able to handle high-end games, but it started chugging and having trouble with even the most basic games. i had no trouble playing Crysis2 at full settings or Skyrim with graphics enhancing mods, but after about 5 minutes of play, EVERY game would go from &gt;45FPS to &lt;3FPS in a heartbeat. i can&#39;t even play Morrowind for more than a few minutes before the game goes from stellar to garbage. i used to be able to run Photoshop with 10 or more vector layers, special effects and crap tons of filters. Then out of nowhere i could hardly draw a stick figure without the whole computer freaking out and crashing or dumping Photoshop.

Reinstalling WindowsXP did nothing. After a day or so of my computer running &quot;like new&quot;, it would hit the wall and give up. i kept using it regardless but went easy on it and stopped playing certain games or using troublesome applications.

A month ago, i started having trouble using multiple applications at once. Combinations of programs i USED to run together all the time started causing problems. i almost always play movies and TV shows on my secondary display while using Photoshop, playing Minecraft or surfing the web. i&#39;ve been doing this with no problem for years now. The computer could handle it fine, but recently i started having glitchy problems with audio skipping and video jumping or cutting out.

About two weeks ago, the computer started having trouble booting. Every so often, the computer could hang in POST. All drives were identified, memory passed its test, then POOF! No blue screen, no error, no nothing. Just a quick restart. After 2 or 3 cycles of that, XP would boot and i&#39;d be back to normal...minus the jumpy graphics and audio.

THEN about a week ago, the computer started freezing at random. Sometimes 3 minutes after boot, sometimes an hour, or even half way through the WindowsXP splash screen, the entire PC would hang. No error, no blue screen; just HANG. i&#39;d then have to restart by cutting the power completely. For some reason, the reset button would kill the power, but it wouldn&#39;t reSTART; it&#39;s just sit there with a blank screen until i yanked the power cord.

Unsure of WHAT the problem was, i took the PC out back and blew it out with compressed air and gave it a good cleaning. Thinking it could be a cooling issue, or power problem, i unplugged and re-plugged everything from the PSU, cleaned all the fans, swapped memory sticks, re-set the motherboard, etc.

...then everything worked JUST GREAT for 3 days. Like NEW!
No POST problems, no audio/video problems, nothing at all!

Turned on the PC today and ran through the crashing on POST issue. &quot;Here we go again&quot;. Now my sound card is invisible. Although my drivers are intact, my PC can&#39;t see my sound card. Not more than an hour ago, i was watching movies and playing sound without issues. Then all of a sudden, it&#39;s like somebody just yanked the card from the motherboard.

i&#39;m afraid of what&#39;s going to happen next.

--

i&#39;ve made NO CHANGES to the machine either in software or hardware that would inadvertently damage my drivers or hardware. it seems that with every few days that passes, there&#39;s something else that just...STOPS working.

i can&#39;t afford to go out and buy a new $1,500 PC. What do you guys think the problem could be?

<p>It should, but depending on which version you get there are apparently limits.<br>

            <p>Look at temps - <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Realtemp</a> is what I use for CPU temps and <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/downloads/2154/TechPowerUp_GPU-Z_v0.6.3_w_ASUS_ROG_Skin.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GPUZ</a> to monitor CPU temperatures.</p>
<p>CPU should be less than 40c at idle really (although not a biggie if it is over) and less than 70c on full load - some CPU’s can go higher but as you have not posted specs I cannot assume you have older hardware.</p>
<p>GPU will probably idle around the 50c ish mark and max out 95c - although it shouldn’t be getting this hot really. Double check your drivers are compatible with windows XP.</p>
<p>Next check your RAM with something like Memtest86+, without doubt the most common physical problem with PCs is the RAM becoming faulty. This causes all sorts of problems. If you get errors test each DIMM on it’s own in each slot to identify the faulty DIMM or RAM slot.</p>
<p>Check BIOS updates for fixes to the problems you are seeing, don’t bother if the change logs don’t look as if they fix anything relevant as it is a risky procedure.</p>
<p>Please post results here so we can check them out for you.</p>

            <p>My (now dead) machine read 3.8Gb of my 4Gb total ram and i use 32bit XP Pro.<br>
in case i decide to install &gt;4Gb of ram in the new PC i’m building, how can i use all of it? i’ve heard it’s got something to do with both your bios and OS. XP typically reads only 3Gb, but i somehow read more than that. i’ve read that Win7 can only read as little as 2Gb in some rare cases.</p>

            <p>You can try checking the bottom of the mobo. If there are some brownish spots under the mobo, then you definitely have to change it. Same applies to the PSU. And post the specs already.</p>

            <p>You do have a point in saying it would probably bias some people if you post your specs.</p>
<p>But troubleshooting a problem is always easier with more info. that’s why i asked. more info = more accurate help.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>as for the beeing biassed, i try to stay objective. after all if you google a bit you can find something wrong with anything from any manufacterer.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>So you’re saying his computer stopped working because the OS stopped being new?<br>
…That’s not how operating systems work. If it was, there would be a lot of unhappy consumers.</p>
<p>I’m going to have to agree with basically everyone that it sounds like a motherboard problem.</p>

            <p>^ this is a good start for sure…</p>
<p>It sounds like things go bad when your CPUs are crankin’… guys, I haven’t used a diagnostic app for any of my PCs in over a decade, but aren’t there any that may shine some light on this shit?</p>

            <p>In these cases I would look for a BIOS update, and if there isn’t, try putting a fan on your northbrige, on some boards it gets too hot and fucks up stability.</p>

            <p>Isn’t it the most fucking unnerving (and certainly upsetting) thing that these <span class="bbcode-b">digital</span> boxes of ours do all kinds of random shit… my dual-opteron MBs are not cheap, but I picked up a spare for dirt on eBay… sitting on a shelf… just in case. Of course, I can’t afford down-time - so it’s money well spent. I sleep better.</p>
<p>Why would you pick up mb+cpu+ram… just replace your mb. I assume it is at least a couple years old. Shit, <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> may be able to grab one for dirt on eBay… nothing unseemly or unorthodox about replacing used parts with used parts either…</p>
<p>And I think there is a solid consensus that it IS your motherboard…</p>

            <p>i intentionally left out my system specs to keep out crap like, “What, you use ASUS hardware?” comments. i know it’s hard to believe, but the internet is full of opinionated asshats who would rather jump to conclusions rather than say something helpful.</p>
<p>i’d also figured it was my mobo. Now i get to figure out how i’m gonna finance a new PC. At least a new mobo+cpu+ram combo.</p>
<p>-Kawai Tei-</p>
<p>EDiT : My specs aren’t important for what i wanted to know. i wanted confirmation that it’s a mobo issue. Posting my specs might have lead the conclusion in the wrong direction, as would posting, “i think it’s my motherboard”. My soundcard is a Creative Audigy2 and i doubt it’s related to the problem. i’ve also upgraded my rig so many times that i’m honestly not even SURE what i have in it currently and i’m nowhere near it right now. LOL</p>

            <p>:\ do you actually have a soundcard?<br>
You also told us fackall about your specs. If you posted this in any respected pc tech forum you would be insta-banned.<br>
Ok were going to assume you have a soundcard, try removing your soundcard and use your mobo instead.(if that works, try putting it in another slot)</p>

            <p>I agree with that, it’s likely a motherboard issue. Even if it’s not overheating any more, it could have overheated before and caused damage to something, or it could just have randomly failed. If you have another PC you could test the components in, do that, and try and narrow it down just to be sure though.<br>
I’ve had PCs with mobo problems do some pretty strange stuff, so it’s certainly a possibility.</p>

            <p>More info (specs and components, maybe overclocks that you did).</p>
<p>the mobo theory is plausible. i’ve had one with hairline fractures in the leads. causes more or less what you are describing. leads not always connecting because of temp changes even stopped it from booting after a few weeks. it’s difficult to figure out though.</p>
<p>did you overclock? if you did you’ve probably already reset to stock speeds. But still that could be the cause of the problem. overclocking does reduce the lifespan of components especially when driving up voltages.</p>
