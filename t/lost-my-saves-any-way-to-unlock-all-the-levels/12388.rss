    <title>Lost my saves, any way to unlock all the levels?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/lost-my-saves-any-way-to-unlock-all-the-levels/12388</link>
    <description>I recently had an issue with my computer. I had to take it back to the store and exchange it. I lost all my saves and had to re-download all my games. I don&#39;t want to play all the way through again, so is there any way I can just start from where ever? I believe I was at chapter 13.</description>
