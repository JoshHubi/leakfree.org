<p>Also the Harry Potter movies. The first two were great, but after that they just got a bit shit.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s because the books became longer than the movies, meaning they have to cut out more and more to fit it into one movie. I liked 3, though 4 was ADD and 5, though I think it was actually the best <span class="bbcode-i">movie</span>, was hard to follow if you hadn’t read the book. And it was angsty, but so was the book, so I didn’t mind.</p>

<p>No, no, no. The ONLY thing that sucked about Star Wars, was Episode 2-3. Why? Because Hayden Christanson is a TERRIBLE actor, he should have been some random guy that was on the ship in episode 2 that explodes in the beginning. So IMO, they should just remake 2 and 3.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Personally I don’t think he is a terrible actor, but he was <span class="bbcode-i">definitely</span> miscast for the part, AND the writing Lucas gave him was so terrible you could be a great actor and still fail at it.</p>

<p>I thought it was just a sequel/rerelease with new effects.</p>
<p>why do they remake things that are fine the way they are?</p>
<p>On that note, Rob Zombie doing a remake of Robocop would be badass.</p>

<p>The soundtrack might be incredibly awesome if they partner up again.</p>
<p>I have to admit, Robocop is the best re-make idea considering how dated it looks but how entertaining it was originally. The original cast won’t be missed. The story was actually really good, it just felt a little cheesey from the era it was made.</p>

<p>Having said that, I would like to see a prequel, and then a remake of the original. Forbidden Planet. I would like to see what happened to the science team as they discover the alien planet, and then watch as their subconsciouses kill each other off one by one. And then see what happens when the unsuspecting rescue team shows up and gets torn apart (partially) as well.</p>

<p>It’s all part of the marketing for teens now…all the great action movies (Die Hard, T1, Alien/Aliens, Predator) they were all at least 15s and mostly 18s.</p>
<p>Die Hard 4 -  had an ok plot…but 12a? If John McClane doesn’t audibly say “Yippee-kai-ay mother fucker!”…then its a total fail.</p>
<p>Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Sin City and the new Batman films are the only grown up action movies in the last 5 years…and they all kicked ass.</p>

            <p>I would love a modern-day remake of Stachka.</p>
<p>Otherwise, every old movie I enjoyed is still fantastic in every aspect but camera quality, and you can’t replace some of the casting… (Buster Keaton, Peter Sellers, young Woody Allen are all priceless actors).</p>
<p>Plus every newer movie I didn’t enjoy is likely to repeat its failures with a remake. I like to let bad movies fail in peace.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. aren’t making 18 rated comic movies anymore, after watchmen’s box office let down.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think they’re making a Jonah Hex <a>i</a> [/i][/SIZE][/SIZE]movie. I haven’t read any of the comics, but they do look pretty “mature.”<br>
Also, I’m sure the “Watchmen” film will have a large cult following, similar to Bladerunner. It will be printing money in DVD sales later this month.</p>

Get Zack Snyder to make it and it’ll kick ass!</p>

            <p>I don’t want a remake of Soylent Green, but there is an Aftermath-prequel-Rehash coming around that seems interesting.</p>
<p>Doom and Star Wars Episodes 2 and 3 sucked.</p>
<p>Doom should have been a reenactment of the Doom Comic.</p>
<p>Boba Fett does not need an origin, and shouldn’t be a Clone of a faggot Australian.</p>
<p>Grievous would be better as some reptile lightsaber dude with cool lightsaber-feet-moves instead of a droidfag with four arms.</p>

            <p>Not that the old ones were bad, but The Lord of the Rings movies that were done word for word to the books (probably take about a day to watch each part admittedly  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) would be awesome.</p>
<p>Also the Harry Potter movies. The first two were great, but after that they just got a bit shit.</p>

            <p>“The Thing” is the best horror movie ever made, over 9000 days old and still has better effects and gore then most movies to date.<br>
The first two “Alien” movies which are also very old are absolutely a work of art and truly shows how much work went into creating them instead of throwing in a last-minute special effect done by computers.<br>
There’s not many movies with computer effects I like, except those from Marvel.</p>
<p>As for remakes; you can’t remake “The Thing” without the original producer, i’d love to see a remake of “Robocop”.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
