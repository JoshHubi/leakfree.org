    <title>My TF2  Map</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/my-tf2-map/405</link>
    <description>Hello. I&#39;m gonna try to make a tf2 map using source sdk. Below is a very rough idea of what I&#39;m going to try and do. The peach/brown line in the middle is a canyon that can only be exited at the ends of the level where there are black arrows. Ignore the &#39;S&#39;! The grey lines are pipes which players can walk through. It will be a control point map where you have to attack AND defend to mix things up a little. The control points are the circles. 

If anyone has any advice, it&#39;d be very helpful (it&#39;s my first ever map). I also suck at names so if you have any ideas, feel free to post. Also, if the plan doesn&#39;t fit all the classes, tell me and I will try and improve it.

Thanks and sorry if this is in the wrong section, I&#39;m kinda new here. 

tl;dr: I&#39;m making a TF2 map and this is my plan. How can I improve

[b]EDIT: I&#39;m having issues with selecting a ground texture. The map is meant to have &#39;desert&#39; theme. When I select a ground texture, it looks so bland. I was wondering whether there is a way to make the ground texture differ to add things like paths that blend in to the rest of the ground texture. Sorry for the bad description of what I am trying to do.[/b]

            <p>I’ve always wanted to create an underwater TF2 map with little caves where the CPs would be, but meh, I have absolutely NO CLUE about coding.</p>
<p>I like your map, though. The bridges and pipes will be a nice place to practice the Sandman taunt. Good luck! Hope you upload a little YouTube video later to see how things are looking.</p>

<p>Well there is a paint alpha option in a displacement tool where you can blend 2 different textures on the same displacement, assuming of course the texture supports those kind of shenanigans. It should have a blend in its name. (If you use Valve’s textures.)</p>
<p>And if all else fails, why don’t you just build your paths with differently textured blocks?</p>

<p>I’ll defiantly take a look t that when I get to the texturing stage. Thanks</p>

<p>That is a very idea! I might just use it and put another body of water around the control points.</p>

<p>It is. I was just getting bored of modelling so took a short break and started fiddleing with the textures. Figured it would be best to prepare for the later stages.</p>

<p>Anyway, I suggest you make you map more symmetrical. Swap round the control point and respawn points for one of the teams. That way the map won’t be at all biased, with both teams getting the same on each side.</p>
<p>(Though it’s fine to make the asthetics different for each team. It gives a bit of change, but not gameplay wise.)</p>

<p>I assume you mean the pipe. I did not notice that! I have edited the picture to a new one taking that into consideration. Do you have any advice on the ground texture issue because I haven’t figured that out yet.</p>
