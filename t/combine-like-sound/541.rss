    <description>Hihi.
I was wondering if anyone knew if any software for audio editing where I can create Combine sounding speech?

I could record a normal voice, Ans I was hoping to change it into something like the &quot;Attention, Miscount detected in sector...&quot; and the actual Metro Cop speech.

Thanks again. :jizz:</description>

<p>Okay I made this combine voice of me saying “You there, pick up that can” in Audacity by doing (in this order) a Hard Limiter effect (repeated &gt; 1x), followed by Equalization (also more than one time). I saved it as a mp3/wav, then opened it again to find my settings for each of the effects missing to recreate it. I tried to look at the Audacity effect history, but it was not there because it was not saved as a project. Anyway, here it is. It sounds really nice, so it’s a shame I don’t know what settings I used. It almost sounds like a direct recording from the game… at parts. Also, there are a few horrible, little tests of how well I could do some simple effects of HL2: Episode 2, such as radio-voice, metrocop, antlion/animal growl, tv-echoes, and horrible microphone quality. I only used the advanced effects above on part of the clip, you can hear it cut over to the better edited part about 20 seconds in… At least it sounds better than using the Valve distortion.bcs files…</p>
<p>Yeah parts of it don’t make sense, because I made it in like 5 minutes and couldn’t think of anything else to say. I just started saying random words at one part.</p>

<p>Nice walkie-talkie effect. It’s good, but what’s missing is that classic ‘Bleep bloop’ sound as heard on Half-Life.</p>

<p>Sorry to crap on this thread, but while that IS a very cool voice effect, and obviously with the right voice actor would sound combine, i thought it was a bit too much like a kazoo, and not coarse enough. Also, find yourself a female voice actor, and make the words distinguishable, which they are in HL2, just difficult to make out.</p>

<p>Hey, it all helps for later. Thanks guys! I just wish I could recreate my settings. I am messing around with it now trying to get it as close as possible with no luck as of yet…</p>

            <p>There is a batch converter file in the source sounds .gcf that might work “distorto_radio.bcs” but it requires Sonic Foundry’s Sound Forge. Even then I can’t guarantee it’s the right file.</p>
<p>Edit: Turns out that batch file did basically nothing. There’s a radio and loud speaker batch file, which sound awesome, but no Metrocop or Soldier files. :’(</p>

            <p>First, sound like a combine as much as you can with your own voice.</p>
<p>Then, talk into a vocoder with tupperware over your head</p>
