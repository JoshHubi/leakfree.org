    <title>WTF happened in Norway?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wtf-happened-in-norway/2095</link>
    <description>Have the Combine finally unlocked the secrets of the Borealis?

Did a White Forest launch go horribly wrong?

Even scarier... are the Russians up to something?

Strange spiraling shapes appeared in the skies above Norway in the middle of the night... which was around sunset in the U.S. [i]today[/i]. (Dec. 9, 2009)

Read about it [url=&#39;https://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/09/awesomely-bizarre-light-show-freaks-out-norway/&#39;]here[/url], [url=&#39;https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/troms_og_finnmark/1.6902392?index=false&#39;]here[/url] and [url=&#39;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1234430/Mystery-spiral-blue-light-display-hovers-Norway.html&#39;]here[/url].

Make no mistake, this is either one of the most spectacular mishaps in rocket science or the strangest natural phenomenon ever witnessed on a large scale.

Maybe Valve will do some &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; action for EP3?

I sure hope so. :awesome:

[COLOR=&#39;DarkRed&#39;][b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] The first two questions are utterly and categorically facetious. If you had to read this paragraph to understand that, we all finally welcome you to the real world; don&#39;t get hurt. The links are, in fact, bona-fide news coverage. These are not made up, this phenomenon is not a hoax. You should hear more about it tomorrow, but for now, it&#39;s wonderfully awesome... both the strangeness of it and the location that seems to be rather close-by to the approximate geographic regions intimated in [i]HL2:Ep1[/i] and [i]HL2:Ep2[/i]. Thank you for reading.[/SIZE]</description>

<p>Thanks for making the fantastic so perfectly mundane and pedestrian. :meh:</p>
<p>I don’t deny the facts, though.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Norwegian astronomer Knut Jørgen Røed Ødegaard says it’s <span class="bbcode-b">99.9%</span> safe to say that it’s a rocket out of control, while some newspapers and TV channels are quoting Russian military sources, <span class="bbcode-i">confirming that this is a failed Bulava missile </span>launched from a nuclear submarine in the White Sea.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My whole premise of posting was to suppose that the boys (and girls) at Valve might just latch-on to this event as a viral tie-in.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be funny if they started re-working the whole start of EP3 to mirror this story? Instead of a helicopter, they land at a Baltic port and board a nuclear sub?</p>
<p>Arriving at the Borealis by submarine would be more suspenseful, IMHO.</p>
<p>Also… you have to wonder what the astronomer believes could be that 0.01% margin of doubt? After all, if they’re not 100% sure, there must be a reason.</p>

            <p>This dual-spiral formation has been shown to be created by a spinning object which is leaking fuel at the same time its propulsion is combusting - in other words its consistent with an out of control missile.</p>
