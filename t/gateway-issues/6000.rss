    <title>Gateway issues?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gateway-issues/6000</link>
    <description>So, I bought a refurbished Gateway NV52 laptop about six months ago. (Don&#39;t judge me for the refurbished part, I&#39;m a cash-strapped student!)

Anyway, when I bought the laptop, it was running Windows Vista. Bleugh. After about three months, I upgraded to a digital copy of Windows 7 Home Premium. However, after the upgrade, my computer would occasionally freeze for a few moments, after which the screen would go black. Not &#39;off&#39; black, but every pixel would go black, or occasionally, gray. There was no rhyme or reason to the freezing, although it generally occurred while I was actively using the computer for at least half an hour. 

At first I thought that it was an issue with the (legal) digitally downloaded copy of Windows 7 that I was using, so I downloaded Windows 7 Eternity edition and installed it. Everything seemed to go fine.... until the same problem cropped up. Now, I really don&#39;t want to have to reformat, especially if the problem crops up again, so anyone have any bright ideas to what this problem might be? My only theory is that it&#39;s something to do with the Gateway-provided BIOS.

Also, I know it&#39;s not the computer overheating (has happened while the computer is cold, warm, and hot), it&#39;s not a hardware issue (started the day after installing Win7), I&#39;ve tried defragging, re-installing, running WMD, and just about everything I could think of, so I&#39;ve run through most of the basic stuff already. 

Anyone have any bright ideas?
 WMD hasn&#39;t found any issues,</description>

            <p>I had a not <span class="bbcode-i">totally</span> unsimiliar problem a while back, it probably won’t work, but try resetting the BIOS settings to default. That might fix it.</p>
