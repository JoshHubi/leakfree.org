    <description>Didn&#39;t see a thread for it and I feel this needs a thread to post it in.

After discussing this further with my colleagues, we have decided to not  implement this feature [being able to remove the color tints through the console]. This is the studio’s take on this matter, and I  support this decision:

[i]&quot;As a studio, it is extremely important for us at DICE to have a  unique identity in our games, not only from a gameplay perspective, but  visually as well. While we appreciate that some players might want a  slightly different look to the game, we are proud of the visual identity  of Battlefield 3 and do not wish to change it.&quot;
[/i] 
I apologize for getting anybody’s hopes up, and if you have any further  questions on this subject, I will refer back to the above statement.

            <p>Considering the unfiltered game looks a lot more real than the normal one, I really don’t know why the hell didn’t they just patch the damn thing and add a option to turn it On or off. If I look outside there isn’t much blue- Well, there is because the condo is painted blue, but shut up. It’s okay if they stood behind their mostly blue vision of reality, but I think (and a lot of people too, apparently) that the non filtered version looks like a game with good graphics, while the filtered one makes it looks a lot more low-quality, like you have to play it through a VCR with faulty cables.</p>
<p>Then again, Battlefield 3 is only a stepping stone for the next one, so is 4. I wonder when will EA actually commit to the games rather than the franchises.</p>

<p>Yeah, but for the record its not like its just bandwagon jumping.  The reason its done is because contrast in design helps draw the eye and the most contrasting color to skin tones is usually blue.  Although I think battlefield does it because the blue contrasts the explosions not flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>well heres some news, blue and orange contrast is the biggest cliché in complementory colors ever</p>
<p>and didnt bf3 advertise itself as “the most realistic shooter ever”<br>
if so, they why the filters?</p>
<p>i dont recall france ever looking to blue-tinted through the eyes of people</p>

</aside>
<p>Liking the filter or dislike the filter comes down to pure personal preference so you will never win that argument.  And again thinking its good of a company to stand by its art or preferring they cop out to some people bitching is also preference so you’ll never win that argument either.  I’m just stating my opinion.  I think modern games take to much of a “we can patch it later” attitude already.  I’d like it if more game devs took pride in what they made and put out on release date.  I just think changing things after you put them out in what is supposed to be a finished work is bad.  Patches for gameplay balance are a necessary evil because there is only so much in house testing you can do but most other aspects should be fine out the door.  George Lucas would argue otherwise but George Lucas is a bitch.</p>
<p>The only thing shitty here in my opinion is saying “Oh we’ll do that” and then not doing it.</p>

<p>is fucking gorgeous.</p>
<p>The very fact that they’ve decided not to implement something that’s OPTIONAL because too many people might chose it (what the FUCK) is just wrong to the core.</p>

            <p>That’s too bad. You missed EA’s screwup (or marketing tactic) where a coupon meant to give one free game under $20 allowed you to add any amount of &lt;=$20 games to your cart and get them.</p>

            <p>i stopped playing when they released premium…then i came back to see what the color grading mod was all about</p>
<p>i honestly am surprised that EA would allow for a console command that disables colorgrading (essentially making the game look more colorful and less “ORANGE-BLUE FILTERED” (Which is a shitty trend pioneered by movie cover art nowadays))</p>
<p>i am also quite baffled to how valve doesnt get this as a hint to make cs:go less foggy/desaturated…or at least unlock the cvars for such a thing to be possible</p>
<p>i guess this is a lesson that orange/blue, and “warish” turd-brown filters etc. do NOT make a game look better</p>
<p>Hopfully people will get the picture that filters and lensflares are just cheap tactics to make somthing look “better” (or its just to mask the flaws in aestetics)</p>
<p>thats why crysis is still regarded as the best graphical game, no filters and that jazz, just clear and pure detail</p>

            <p>The lens flare does annoy me, but it is an interesting idea taken from real life.  In war the side facing the sun has a disadvantage.  Also yes the first point is true, they said they were going to and they probably should at this point.  I just hate it when anyone working in an artistic medium doesn’t have the nerve to stand up for what they produced.</p>

            <p>I can appreciate them sticking to their guns but</p>
<ol>
<li>They pretty much said for sure that they were going to do it and are now going back on their word.</li>
<li>A good majority of the people playing the game don’t like the filters and gratuitous lens flare (to the point they’re risking bans to take them off) and it apparently raises performance with them off.</li>
</ol>
