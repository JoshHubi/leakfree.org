    <title>Crash on Surface Tension when exploding fuel truck/helicopter</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-on-surface-tension-when-exploding-fuel-truck-helicopter/14981</link>
    <description>I&#39;m stuck on Surface Tension. I need to destroy the helicopter by blowing up the fuel truck. No matter how I destroy it (rocket launcher led to the first two errors below, a grenade to the third, exploding a nearby barrel does the same thing as far as I can tell), the game freezes and I (usually) get an error message as shown below.

I probably get the popup error message 80% of tries, but the game freezes/crashes every time I try.

<p>Yup, that did it. It was hard to push some of the cots (with corpses on them) so I used a grenade to throw the corpses off them and move them part of the way, then pushed them further. The fuel truck blew up just fine afterwards, without switching off the violence_* options.</p>

            <p>It’s the cots that are causing the crash? That’s interesting…those were giving us some bad physics crashes back when we first started fixing up that section, we thought we’d fixed it, as it never showed up again after that. And the error report makes it look like a gib error. That’s an excellent find, thanks. We’ll look into it, as that simplifies things down a lot!</p>

            <p>Setting those just before exploding the truck still led to the crash. I tried also before bouncing up the bounce pad to the red door just before that area, and I still had the crash. I tried also from before the door to the area with the bounce pad is destroyed, still no luck. I tried going from the previous map (still part of Surface Tension) and switching it off there, then playing. I quicksaved and loaded a few times and once I got to the fuel truck checked the settings before exploding it; still a crash. Then I went from the previous area again, switched off the violence options (the blood ones too, because why not) and played through to the fuel truck without loading. I still had a crash. This one:</p>

            <p>This appears to be a Linux specific gib crash.</p>
<p>Best way to work around it for now, before we can come up with a fix, is to use the following console commands before you get to that section:</p>
<p>violence_agibs 0<br>
violence_hgibs 0</p>
<p>This will disable gibs for that bit.</p>
<p>You can then reenable them after you’ve completed that part.</p>
