    <title>Half-Life HD Pack Permanently in All HL1 Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-hd-pack-permanently-in-all-hl1-games/12074</link>
    <description>Lambda Generation sent out a tweet a few days ago stating that Valve has updated Half-Life and removed the original models and has replaced them all with the Blue Shift HD pack.  I booted up may game and sure enough, the HD pack was in there.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I figured the HL community would be in a huge rage right now???

[b]EDIT:  [/b]I should also add that this HD pack cannot be removed from the game as it was originally.  Going to the HD pack page on Steam and selecting the uninstall option simply displays a window that says the HD pack isn&#39;t installed.</description>

            <p>The Beta is temporary. Such is the nature of a Beta.</p>

            <p>Before I learned about the beta, this pissed me off so much. But seriously, why do I have to enter a beta to play a game the same way I played it almost 15 years ago?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!  I did notice that even if I enable the HD pack, I still get the old models.  Is this due to it being in beta?  I really don’t care but it’s still nice to have the ability to switch.</p>

            <p>Where?  My video tab doesn’t have any sort of option.  I even reinstalled the game and still got nothing.</p>

            <p>Yeah, you can just flip it off if you don’t want it, which is easier than deleting the files or uninstalling them, so what’s the big deal? It’s not really a problem.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I just tested it and you can switch between the original and HD models with an option in the video menu.</p>

            <p>There’s already a thread about this in the tech support section, and I think it was explained that you turn it off in the options menu.</p>
