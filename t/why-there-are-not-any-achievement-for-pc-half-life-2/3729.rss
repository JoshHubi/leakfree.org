<p>It came out in 2004, achievements were not around then. You are also considering that it is an easy job. By all means, it is anything but that. If they were to get HL2 and EP1 up to scratch with your “dumb xbox”, they would have to update the ENTIRE existing source engine to the 2007 version. That’s very hard work, and with Portal Two and (hopefully) EP3 on the horizon, they don’t seem to have to time to do that, and I don’t blame them.</p>
<p>If you are desperate, try a buggy mod that broke HL2 facial animations: <a href="https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1093025</a></p>

<p>Not really a fan of achievements since they don’t give anything other than satisfaction for a completionist and bragging rights. Since I am not a completionist and prefer to brag using skill rather than my ability to carry a gnome across a game, I really have no use for achievements.<br>
I actually have some console fan-boy friends who spend hours, sometimes days on a game that they grew tired of just so that they can get some achievement. And since after that they usually sell the game I really wonder why they bother.<br>
Achievements detract from the whole point of video games. Games should be played for enjoyment, escapism, the ability to do amazing things you would otherwise be unable to do or all those things at once.<br>
Not so that you can spend forever doing something you probably wouldn’t do otherwise just so that you can get a virtual “achievement” that will only really make you lose time out of your life that you could be spending on something else.<br>
Believe me, if you stop trying to get achievements in games you will enjoy them a lot more and you will not have to spend hours for literally nothing.</p>

<p>Achievements do ad re playability though.   I always ignore them when playing through for the first time, then will focus on them when re playing for fun.</p>
<p>Also, this mod has added lighting effects and achievements to HL2 for pc.</p>
