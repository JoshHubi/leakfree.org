    <description>Has anyone else found this?
[url=&#39;https://imgur.com/LZrJI&#39;]link[/url] (not embedding because it&#39;s kinda spoiler-ish)

It&#39;s located in the room the crosshairs are on in [url=&#39;https://imgur.com/7gb0T&#39;]this[/url] shot.

This can only be found using noclip.

EDIT:
Found another one across from that room [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/jaQ9k.jpg&#39;]here[/url]
That was in [url=&#39;https://i.imgur.com/1Iu58.jpg&#39;]this room[/url].

This is connected to the &quot;Black Mesa ARG&quot;. See the thread for it [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?p=497175&#39;]here[/url].</description>
