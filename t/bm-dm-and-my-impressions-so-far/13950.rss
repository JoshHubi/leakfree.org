    <description>Hello, I&#39;m NightMare and I&#39;ve been playing Half-Life since 1999. I&#39;ve been playing the pro mod
called Adrenaline Gamer for years and I love Half-Life to this day, as do many others. I&#39;m amazed
to see the level of detail you guys put into this game throughout years of development and I look forward to seeing this game
become a success. Here&#39;s some suggestions  that I came up with today after a few hours of playing and reading similar threads that I hope helps.

Note: I will edit this thread to include additional issues as they arise.

Issues not addressed to my knowledge:

- Can&#39;t crouch while in the air.
- rpg laser is off by default (it should be on.) Also, there is an increased delay upon firing compared to HLDM.
- Gauss primary fire rate is noticeably slower than HLDM.
- mp5 magazine capacity is 45, in HLDM it&#39;s 50. In HLDM, it spawns with 25 rounds which
requires a reload to have 50 in the magazine.
- No drop weapon bind.
- No team location bind.
- Ability to disable screen bobbing from side to side while moving.
- Gluon splash damage is negligible or nonexistant.
- Satchel throwing distance has been reduced. In HLDM, it can be thrown and detonated in the air.

Important known issues:

- Gauss jump is too powerful. (It should have a more steady and gradual charge to jump various distances.)
- There is a charge delay after shooting the gauss secondary fire. After each shot, whether partial
or full charge, the player should be able to recharge gauss immediatey for movement or shooting purposes.
- No wallgauss.
- Walk key doesn&#39;t work.
- No bunnyhop.
- Long jump cooldown isn&#39;t implemented in HLDM. This should be a server side setting that allows admins to choose to enable or disable and may vary based upon game mode.
- No wall strafe.
- No circle jump.
- Crossbow isn&#39;t hitscan.
- There needs to be customization options for crosshair.
- Zoom style isn&#39;t the same as HLDM for the crossbow and magnum and there&#39;s no quickbow. Zooming should be instant at a fixed fov.
- mp5 recoil isn&#39;t the same as HLDM.
- Lacking game modes including Arena, Arcade, LTS, LMS, CTF, etc...</description>

            <p>I agree with everything you said. The devs need to address all your concerns in order to make this multiplayer actually be skill based, and resemble HL1 <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> M.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I’m not the same guy as in the video you posted. The developers are doing a great job and it was a very good idea to get the community involved in the early access. I believe most of us would like to see these issues fixed. In doing so, this game will be true to the mechanics and gameplay style of the original HLDM.</p>

<p>Is that you playing? I have seen your videos on youtube a while back if you are the same guy lol.</p>
<p>I agree with all the points you made so far. If the devs want to do a remake of hldm, the issues you posted all are 100% accurate :]</p>

            <p>Here’s a video of a game I played yesterday on rapidcore. I was playing in a EU server so my ping was a bit high. The score was 45 kills and 3 deaths.<br>
