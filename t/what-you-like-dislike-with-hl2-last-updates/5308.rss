    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-you-like-dislike-with-hl2-last-updates/5308</link>
    <description>So, that&#39;s it: post your opinions.

- I miss the first APC fight , where you get the monted gun and shoot metrocops. 
- Like the use of the EP2 vorts, but miss the energy bean of the first vort, recharging batteries. Liked much more that bean than those shiny spheres (they remember the scene of the final boss of Opposing force).</description>

            <p>get a new graphics card<br>
you can probably get one that runs it well for less than $20, though I’m not really up to date with prices or anything</p>
<p>but I’m pretty sure an old high end card can run it fine, and since it’s old it shouldn’t cost too much</p>

<p>I don’t know if you guys have this… but ever since the Mac update, when i get to Black Mesa East the lights and shadows all get so fucked up. When I’m on the coast, and i go through a Highway tunnel, it looks as if it’s a rainy day, but, the tunnel isn’t dark at all, this happens until the chapter “Entanglement.” I haven’t found a fix to it yet, and it doesnt change the gameplay. I just don’t like it because it makes the gloomy, dark parts look horribly colored, and the nice, colorful parts look gloomy</p>

<p>Also, I generally like it, apart from the few bugs. And also how they slowed the buggy down so you can’t race the train without dying.</p>

            <p>I like the updated engine, especially the water coastside seems alot less repetitive now.<br>
Also <span class="bbcode-b">on my machine</span> the updated engine runs more smoothly, no lags at full detail and shorter loading times.</p>
<p>That alot of mods needed fixing was a downside, but didn’t affect that many mods I play.<br>
Also the bugs that occured ingame after the update, but valve fixed them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TL;DR:</span><br>
Big “yay” from me.</p>

<p>What I do like however, is the motion blur and AA, I’m pretty sure the version before didn’t have it (at least the motion blur.)</p>

            <p>Uh, the “APC fight” is still there. No part of the game was cut in the update. :\</p>
<p>I like how they used HDR, but I don’t like how they only put it in the coast maps onwards. I also like how they marked more of the caches, but some of them (like the ones in Nova Prospekt) don’t make sense, so that’s a dislike as well.<br>
I’m undecided on achievements, because my gaming PC is rarely connected to the internet, and as such I don’t use steam cloud.</p>
