            <p>My point is that whatever happens, there’s a probability for it. You have a probability for your racehorse to win. However, all of it’s molecules could vibrate in the same direction, sending into the sky at 500m/s: this isn’t accounted for because the chance is so minute.</p>
<p>The probability model works the majority of the time, and that’s what it aims for. If we could define when and where events will occur, it wouldn’t be probability.</p>

            <p>The human model of luck/probability matches it, but not well. It simply substitutes millions of minute influences that we can’t begin to calculate (or don’t care enough to) with a simple mathematical expression to predict certain outcomes. While we may describe them as occurring by chance, we simply don’t have the time, want to put in the effort, or simply can’t with our current technology define when and where these events will occur.</p>

            <p>You’re misunderstanding me there, ijgs. Like I said, chance is just probability of an event: I didn’t say luck, or fortune or any other personified influence was involved.</p>
<p>I disagree that chance/probability is a feeble attempt at rationalising chaos: I think it rationalises it pretty damn well. It’s a model we use to predict the likelihood of events in the chaos that is the universe, nothing more, nothing less. It can’t be feeble or strong: like mathematics, it just <span class="bbcode-i">is</span>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t see what you were actually objecting to in my post.</p>

</aside>
<p>1 in 10,000,000 chances occur at a rate of about 40,000 per second on this planet, if not more frequently (taking every living creature’s procreation into account). “Chance” and “luck” are observed to have happened every day; people die, people are born, accidents are had and avoided and so on. What happens is:</p>
<ol>
<li>“event”</li>
<li>we respond</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>profi… ahem… in hindsight, we consider the initial event to be “lucky” or “unlucky”, depending on how well we came out of it all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Luck &amp; chance are mere human rationalisations of ongoing chaos, NOT influencing factors <span class="bbcode-i">on</span> that chaos. Events either happen or do not happen, there really isn’t any grey area (oh, and insurance is a massive con as a result!).</p>

<p>My point is that these things happened by chance. That first cell was created because of the chemicals and the environmental conditions of the time, and it just so happened that it had the quirk of being able to reproduce.

</aside>
<p>Sorry, but atheists do not go around telling people that they’re going to suffer in agony for all eternity because they don’t believe precisely as atheists believe.  Yes, I’ve been told that, because I didn’t believe exactly as they believe, I was going to “burn” and that they wanted to “save” me from that fate.   Atheists do not go knocking on doors telling others about the “good news”.  Atheists do not try to get laws passed telling religious people what they can and can’t do in accordance with their lack of belief in deities.</p>
<p>Do you honestly believe that atheists are just coming out of the blue with this; that these sorts of Christians are blameless; that they didn’t do anything to bring about the “wrath of the atheist”?  I mean, seriously.  Things don’t happen in a vaccuum.  Actions have consequences.</p>
<p>And don’t even try the “Not all Christians do this” canard.   There is absolutely zero pushback I see from the “not all Christians do this” crowd that they might as well be tacitly approving these actions.</p>
<p>That being said, I don’t hate any religious person for being religious.  In fact, I go one step further.  I actually ascribe to a Christian teaching:  By their fruits, you shall know them.</p>
<p>And I’ve seen enough actions over the years to keep me in supply of fruitcake for the rest of my life.</p>

 Winged One:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ll just put this here…A question to change the topic and ease the tension.</p>
<p>Science tells us we evolved from single-celled organisms thousands upon thousands upon thousands of years ago.  Those first cells, it is theorized, were prokaryotes which fed on nearby minerals from rocks and the like.  This organism is further theorized to be roused from the primordial soup by lighting and heat energy, essentially churning the organic molecules within to create life.  What I never understood is this: Where did it get the will to survive and subsist.</p>
<p>Call it whatever you will, but even though it had no mind, something must have given it life and the ability to want to survive and reproduce.  If we follow the accepted primordial soup model, the resulting object would be a collection of molecules, nothing more.  What gave it life?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>@ the cult/religion thing, it’s worth noting that <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> religions start out as cults; allow me to clarify…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Any</span> belief system that introduces a new set of beliefs &amp; customs will appear faddish, unconventional and dangerous to the status quo. Humans are inherently conservative (small “c”, not big “c”!!) and most are at least marginally resistant to change.</p>
<p>Christianity started out with 12 blokes, led by a charismatic man who had them do (for the time) unconventional things. Assuming you take the bible’s word for it, he also had them pretty devoted to a set of principles and an entity (god). Now consider how most of the disciples ended up (According to Christian tradition):</p>
<p>Original Twelve picked by Jesus:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter, crucified upside-down in Rome circa AD 64.</li>
<li>James, son of Zebedee was beheaded in AD 44, first of the twelve to die (since the addition of Matthias)</li>
<li>John, son of Zebedee, natural causes due to old age, last of the twelve to die, only one of the twelve (or 13 counting Judas Isacariot) to die naturally (as mentioned by Christ at the end of his (John) Gospel.)</li>
<li>Andrew, Peter’s brother, was crucified upon a diagonal or X-shaped cross.</li>
<li>Philip was crucified in AD 54.</li>
<li>Bartholomew (also known as Nathaniel) was flayed alive (skinned) and then beheaded; some sources locate his death at Derbend on the Caspian Sea.[1]</li>
<li>Matthew killed by a halberd in AD 60.</li>
<li>Thomas was killed by a spear in Mylapore, Madras, India in AD 72.</li>
<li>James, son of Alphaeus, beaten to death with a club after being crucified and stoned.</li>
<li>Jude was crucified.</li>
<li>Simon the Zealot was crucified in AD 74.</li>
<li>Judas Iscariot, according to the gospels, hanged himself after betraying Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replacement picked by the surviving eleven:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matthias, Judas’ replacement, was stoned and beheaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>I presume 12 out of 13 died not because they were jolly nice people, but because they were out there, spreading the word and making ripples in the pond. Even the most cursory reading of the bible would reveal Peter to be something of a zealot and there’s little reason to think that the other disciples were any more moderate in their attitude; if they were they wouldn’t have been killed in such exciting and inventive ways. It’s also worth noting that Romans crucified slaves, pirates and <span class="bbcode-b">enemies of the state</span>. So clearly at least 6 of them may have been engaged in activities that were socially unacceptable.</p>
<p>By way of balance, consider any of the “ancient” religions, i.e. the ones that Christianity and its brothers supplanted;</p>
<ul>
<li>The multi-deity Greek &amp; Roman religions</li>
<li>paganism</li>
<li>the multi-deity religion of ancient Egypt</li>
<li>Ba’al and other “vengeful” gods (including the vengeful god of the Old testament)<br>
to name but a few… All of these religions had significant numbers of followers and all of them had established doctrines and rituals that were assiduously followed. People lived (and died) for these beliefs and yet if you subscribe to any of them today, you’re branded a cultist by people who, a mere two thousand years ago, would have been considered cultists themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know about you, but in my book, that’s irony.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Hello everybody !<br>
Checking this forum, i couldn’t help but see that my country was mentionned… Well, for all its faults, the french Republic still has this little thing that changes everything : Church is separated from the State. No one here would try to make you feel guilty about being an atheist (or a believer, for that matter) danielsangeo, as per our Constitution religion is considered strictly private. Which is pretty neat when you need to fight things like scientology, or extremists.<br>
<span class="mention">@SassyRobot</span> :<br>
Don’t be fooled by definitions, for if they seem set in stone, the things they describe are born in history. Christian church didn’t start as a full-blown religion. And any religion can degenerate into a cult. Nothing is pure and everything changes.</p>

            <p>I typed wrong.  I meant to write some Christians (and, if you’ll read my entire post, you’ll see that I wasn’t talking about all Christians and I know other Christians don’t consider Jesus to be the founder of Christianity but some Christians do) but not all Christians, so I beg forgiveness.</p>
<p>However, the problem I have with Christianity (and, yes, the majority of Christians that I’ve ever run into that I tell that I’m an atheist) is the command to be “spread the word” which many take as a command to “spread the word even to people that don’t want to hear it”.</p>
<p>I have had Christian after Christian after Christian many hundreds of times over try to “save” me or to “educate” me “on God’s word” that I’ve taken to not reveal that I’m atheist as it almost always leads to an argument.  For example, here’s one that I had about 9 months ago:</p>
<p>Them: “So, I just told my pastor that I would be coming to Sunday mass.  Would you like to come?”<br>
Me: “Nah, but thanks.”<br>
Them: “Oh, it’ll be fun.”<br>
Me: “Nah.”<br>
Them: “Okay, if you come to my church, I’ll come to yours.”<br>
Me: “I don’t go to church.”<br>
Them: “…what?  Why?”<br>
Me: “I’m an atheist.”<br>
Them: “…”<br>
Me: “I don’t believe in God.”<br>
Them: “That’s terrible!”</p>
<p>And that’s when the argument started.  If they had simply said, “Okay” after I told them that I was an atheist, that would’ve been the end, but they started saying that what I believed and didn’t believe was “terrible” and I naturally took offense.</p>

<p>Christians/Muslims/other religious people commit crimes, murder, etc. just as much as non-religious people do. It’s just that people don’t want to take responsibility for their actions, and once the consequences fall on them, they try to use religion as a scapegoat for their actions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If anything, I think Christians/Muslims/other religious people <em>on average</em> commit more crimes.  Note that the percentage of the population that actually commits crimes is, y’know, fairly small.</p>
<p>Some of these crimes (or even less than kind actions), of course, have nothing to do with their religion and would be committed by a believer and non-believer alike.</p>
<p>Sometimes people of some religions may be tempted to do things because they think they can simply ask for forgiveness (more or less exclusive to non-crimes).</p>
<p>And some people are motivated by their religious beliefs to do things like shoot doctors who work at abortion clinics.</p>
<p>Of course, trying to figure out what truly motivates people is an interesting question.  Do people do things or believe things because their religion tells them to (and if so, what areas does this apply to) or do they typically pick religions that validate their own beliefs?</p>
<p><a href="https://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/11/creating_god_in_ones_own_image.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/11/creating_god_in_ones_own_image.php</a></p>
<p>Personally, I think it depends.  For example, I doubt people would think using electronics on Saturday is a big no-no without religion.  On the flip side, many people have an emotional reaction to things such as abortion would be “pro-life” regardless…then you also have the “Cafeteria Catholics” in America who are pro-choice, which is interesting.</p>
<p>In general, I only care what someone believes when they try to force that on me in one way or another.  Unfortunately, in a democracy, this tends to happen every election, of course.  You also have people trying to insert Creationism into science classes instead of history and various other things…but the people who are actively pushing things like that aren’t your “typical” Christian, to be fair.  However, most “typical” Christians also don’t seem to have an issue with that and give tacit consent.</p>
<p>In regards to a question a page or two back about “will to survive,” I was under the impression that assigning a “will” to creatures without a brain didn’t make much sense.  I believe there’s an idea that basically everything we do is a function of our genes trying to survive (and we are our genes), but as I haven’t taken a biology class past high school, I wouldn’t be the person to ask on that.</p>
<p>The very idea of a “will” is also interesting…as most things seem to point at the idea of “mind/body” duality as being flawed, aka the notion of a separate soul that controls the brain…instead of the brain being the brain.</p>
<p>Oh, and Scientology is fine.  I’ll even give you fine ladies and gentlemen a special discount on our goods for the next 72 hours, so call now!  1-800-IMCRAZY</p>
