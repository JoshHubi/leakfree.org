    <title>Will the Xen Update likely break most steam workshop addons?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-the-xen-update-likely-break-most-steam-workshop-addons/15407</link>
    <description>Like the title says, anyone think the[b] Xen Update[/b] likely break most steam workshop addons? I know in the past some have disabled a few addons, but I also know that usually half of the addons don&#39;t get altered.

Side note, anyone actually enjoy using any workshop addons?
I personally enjoy the ones that make it closer to og Half Life like the original soundtrack. Some I find are just game improving overall like the Realistic Damage addon and the Revolver Skin... and the remastered original HECU voices. [/size]</description>

            <p>It depends on what they do with the engine. The reason why all the maps on the workshop broke, (and to be honest, many are still broken) was because the lighting engine went through an update. Unless they radically change how the textures and sounds are handled, nothing will be broken. (Except for the maps, but that’s the mappers fault for not releasing a fixed version.)</p>
