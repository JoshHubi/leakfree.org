            <p>I think the puzzles could have been a bit more complex, at least from the perspective of someone that has played other Half-Life games.  I got past all of them pretty quickly.  Map design, music and overall feel I also enjoyed, though I don’t think they took full advantage of the engine’s graphics.  I also thought the voice-acting was awesome.  The beginning scene was pretty cool.  Forced me to play differently, as I normally like to loiter, explore every crevice and break everything that is breakable, but you were forced to keep running (which is more realistic).</p>

            <p>It was really fun, but short. Not much gameplay elements but map design, music and feeling was great.</p>

            <p>I played it… It was really nice I have to say… but nothing was really “new” except for the healing thing of the hunter.</p>
