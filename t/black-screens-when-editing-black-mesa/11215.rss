    <title>Black screens when editing Black Mesa</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-screens-when-editing-black-mesa/11215</link>
    <description>Hey there, hopefully this thread is in the right spot, because I need some help  :frowning:  . I&#39;ve added Black Mesa to my SDK to make some custom maps as I&#39;m sure many people have, but unfortunately I am experiencing a problem with hammer.
 
   It loads up fine, but I went to start a new map all the ports were blank and black, no grid and no response from the tools. Also in the camera window (top left) I can move around but can&#39;t select anything or at least am not getting a response from selecting anything.

   Is there a fix or something for this bug? , because for lack of another word it&#39;s making it very difficult to map ...

   Thanks!

            <p>There’s a thread around here somewhere on it, but if you don’t feel like searching you could do what I did before I saw that thread;</p>
<p>Make a mod under the Source 2007 configuration. Name it whatever, you’re just going to delete it. Use any available option besides Source Code Only. Refresh the list by switching engines to any other build and back.<br>
Then open the edit game configurations menu, and manually create one for BM. Delete the configuration for your temporary mod, as well as the folder structures the SDK made for it.</p>
<p>Open Hammer, set up the FGDs and your default preferences, and test it.</p>

<p>Resetting the Game Configs would add Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and most other Source games, you sure you did it right?</p>
<p>And you did do it in Source SDK and not by opening Source SDK Base 2007?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was in the small main menu of the SDK, and the Engine version was set to 2007, and I clicked “reset game configurations” which mentioned it would reset all mods and so on, then I tried to “edit game configurations” and got the “no game configurations to run with” message.</p>
<p>Here’s what I was looking at :</p>
<p>Also what would I do to manually change it?<br>

            <p>Sometimes resetting game configs doesn’t fix that problem, open the GameConfig.txt in the source2007 bin folder and add the entry manually, that should work.</p>

            <p>Re-set it up under the Source '07 build in the SDK. Just select the Source 2007 in the engine menu thingy, click edit game configurations and add. You’ll probably have to reconfigure your Hammer setup as well.</p>

<p>Oh that makes sense, it’s under 2009 in my SDK. How would I go about changing it back to 2007?</p>
