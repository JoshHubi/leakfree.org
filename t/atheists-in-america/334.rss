    <description>Hi all,
recently I saw a program which reported that atheists aren&#39;t welcome in USA.
They said they&#39;re in the opinion of the americans below immigrants and muslims.
Is this true?</description>

<p>While it was supposed to be humorous, I do pretty much agree with him on the whole no God thing. I find it incredibly self-important and arrogant that people think we’re the pinnacle of everything in the Universe, made in the image of a supreme-being who seems to have done a second rate job, and then eternally punishes people for next to nothing.</p>
<p>But that’s just me.</p>

And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do.

            <p>This thread is fucking stupid.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>There is never any way to win or lose this argument.</p>
<p>Religious nuts are always going to be blindly faithful and atheists are always going to lovingly cling onto guesstimates and science.</p>
<p>If you actually have ever tried to win a religion argument you are a tool.</p>

<p>most of the christians I know think of the bible as more of  a metaphor than an actual historical account. the old testament anyway, although a good bit of the new testament as well. Some people view God as more of an ideal than an actual physical (or spiritual, depending on how you look at it) being. In my mind, 99% of being a “good christian” is just being a good person.</p>
<p>I (plus 99% of the other people in my church) have absolutely no problems with other religions, as long as they don’t tell people to hurt other people. Note that I’m not singling out Islam here, the vast majority of Muslim scholars believe that terrorists are going to burn in hell for eternity. Again, according to my history class, Muhammad taught that the Major Jihad was against evils insider yourself, while the minor jihad was against infidels, which actually are not christians/jews (which are acceptable religions to Muslims) I’m not trying to offend anyone, sorry if I do. If I’m off the mark, please correct me.</p>

<p>Your church doesn’t seem very liberal… But that may be influenced by the fact that I live in Massachusetts.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I don’t know anyone who believes that science and religion can’t coexist. According to the flashcards I just finished, Aquintas proved that in about 1100 CE.</p>
<p>I’m probably much more liberal than most Christians, but the Christians described ITT are much, much more conservative than most Christians. I can think of sects that are much more liberal than me. Not going to name them, but some of them object to their leaders referring to God, as they disagree on God’s nature.</p>

<p>Correction, they’re asked to declare that they believe in a Supreme Being, without going into too much detail, that doesn’t necessitate the sentient God type being common in the monotheistic religions.

<blockquote>
<p>They’re Freemasons, which believe in God.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Correction, they’re asked to declare that they believe in a Supreme Being, without going into too much detail, that doesn’t necessitate the sentient God type being common in the monotheistic religions.  Given the mandates of Masonry, I would be more inclined to interpret Supreme Being as the perfection of self for the betterment of others.</p>

<p>Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time!</p>
<p>But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He’s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can’t handle money!</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-b">BEFORE</span> any one reads below this point, I share both views as well as growing up in a family with two religious views, (Christian and Baháí; originates in Asia some where) AND being exposed to the Science of the modern world, I have at least three views that I can use to put my argument into prospective.</p>
<p>Before you read beyond this point, if your going to slander me <span class="bbcode-i">or</span> start up a flame war, please do some research and give me some hard proof to your points. Other wise, you’ll be doing nothing then blowing hot air.</p>

<p>I’ve always seen religion as almost the “why” we are here, since along with God and creation there is also a lot of things about loving your neighbor and world peace. Before you start arguing about crusades and stuff, I would like to point out a few things though:</p>
<ol>
<li>Different people think “peace” can be accomplished different ways and</li>
<li>I’ve heard people argue “Muslim’s are wrong, they think they have to kill the infidels when the bible says ‘Thou shall not murder’!”. While I agree it’s wrong, I’ve always seen it as they don’t see “infidels” as murder in the same way as most people don’t see hunting for food as “murder”. Basically, same religions, just different interpretation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Most of these are valid points, it’s the incredibly devout idiots (priests and/or regular people calling some one a heretic and basically turning into Hitler) that really make my blood boil, <span class="bbcode-i">along</span> with some of the Neo Nazis laying around in the South that give Christianity a bad name… it’s the same with the Terrorists over in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Science, on the other hand, I see as the “how”. How did God create the universe? How is everything set up on this place we call “earth”? I’ve found both make more sense if you find a way to combine them. Again, that’s just me.</p>

<p>I would like to point out I do not believe in anyway Atheists are bad. While I have no idea (assuming there is a heaven) if they will go to heaven, I know plenty of Atheists who are wonderful people and may even be better people than some Christians I know.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, it’s the idiots that give them a bad name… I believe in the little man sitting up in the clouds, but I don’t like worshiping, this is why I <span class="bbcode-i">hate</span> people who try to tell me “if you don’t worship him, you burn” or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Atheists or Freemasons, have a pick.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They’re Freemasons, which believe in God… your thinking of the Illuminati as the “Atheists”. They got driven underground by the Church in the ancient past. Leonardo Da Vinci was apart of them, however, he was a practicing Catholic.</p>
<p>On topic, no, generally the ones who are dumb enough to start screwing with people because of their backrounds generally get arrested for Harassment or the other guy/person(s) move before any thing happens.</p>
<p>Edit: To sum up my rambling; those people only represent about 0.0001% of the religious/atheist population… the good ones who can remain calm are extremely rare in these debates, they’re opinions are prolly the most valued because they can argue their points and show it with out making themselves look like an idiot and/or offending the other person… that is assuming they want their ear raped.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m a total christian who goes to church weekly, believes in God, and tries to live a “Christian lifestyle”, and I officially hate you for saying that. That isn’t the way to “convert people”, it just makes people angry for being told to more or less “go to hell”.</p>
<p>I somewhat agree with intooblivion. Mostly because you can’t have the kind and generous “christian God” and then have him condemning people to hell. It just can’t possibly work that way.</p>
