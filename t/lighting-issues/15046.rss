    <title>Lighting Issues</title>

    <description>I&#39;m having issues with the game being too dark. When the game initially loads, it&#39;s perfectly bright, but then slowly darkens to the point where I can barely see anything. I&#39;ve already attempted to adjust this in the advanced video settings and following a few suggestions on other threads but with no effect. Any suggestions?</description>

            <p>I remember <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/29066-Everything-Gets-Really-Dark/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">an old thread addressing a very similar problem</a>, but IIRC not a lot came of it. Then in one of the fix updates the developers claimed to have resolved this problem.</p>
