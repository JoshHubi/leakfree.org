    <title>L4D2 Infected Bots?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/l4d2-infected-bots/2268</link>
    <description>So a friend and I just love playing L4D2 because it&#39;s just a good, solid game (duh). We&#39;ve done all the campaigns on all difficulty-levels, and have now moved on to 1v1 (yes, ha ha at us) Versus. It&#39;s still mad fun, even though the Survivors can&#39;t lose because of the limit to 1 Special Infected at a time each round, but so far my friend and I have just enjoyed trying to end eachother in original/clever ways (or at least have funny moments).

And this is where a huge flaw (imho) in the game comes in, and I still can&#39;t believe Valve left this out.. Why are there no Special Infected-bots to fill the team? Anyway, I decided to check into getting some third party mod or plugin to get some Infected bots (I really don&#39;t care whether they have good AI or not), and found this forum called AlliedModders that had a plugin for this, using MetaMod and SourceMod. I tried to follow the &quot;install instructions&quot; (that didn&#39;t exist and required some additional googling) for those things and the plugin, but I just couldn&#39;t get it to work in L4D2.

Now, I tried asking for help over there, but they seem to be the elitist-kind-of-reets that laugh at you for not having spent the last 3 years setting up these things (and hell forbid the possibility that there&#39;s people out there that are doing this for the first time), so I didn&#39;t get any help in there. So Now I&#39;m aiming at the only HL2-related forum I&#39;m on (yes, you guys!) for help.

Could anyone give me a step-by-step to get Infected Bots into L4D2 (the &quot;2&quot; is important here), either through this plugin or some other way?

Pwetty pwease? :x


PS: &quot;Get more friends&quot; -&gt; I tried, but all the gamer-ones have grown some weird hatred-tumor that makes them dislike anything Valve-related.. I think it was the betas of Steam that caused it.</description>

            <p>First of all, Merry Christmas y’all!</p>
<p>Secondly, thanks for the replies so far (minus that one post). That mod was indeed what I was trying to use. After a lot of checking and reinstalling, I got it working by downloading one of the new “instable” beta builds of SourceMod (not the recommended one), and now it works just fine, though the survivor-bots seem to got dumber… Even more than normal (gasp)</p>
<p>But it sure did improve the fun abd quality of these 1v1s (I actually managed to wipe my friend’s run in the Parish just outside the starting safehouse, but that was mainly because his bots bugged out. Still, mad fun! :p)</p>

            <p>I know it’s possible, I play on a server quite often that has it working. Unfortunately, I have no idea what mod he actually uses. I’ll try and get a hold of him though.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here’s the mod he uses and it works great.</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=893938" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=893938</a></p>
<p>It might be the one you tried given it’s the same forum. However, he <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> get it working on L4D2. Unfortunately, I’ve never worked with it myself so I can’t give you any more help.</p>

            <p>It’s quite possible that the SourceMod plugins might not work properly in L4D2 yet (I don’t see why they wouldn’t, but unless they are specifically designed for L4D2, its possible…) - I would wait for a stable release of the plugins for L4D2 in order to get bots working.</p>
<p>Why not just use the built-in matchmaking system to find people to play Vs with? There are always idiots playing but a lot of the time you can get people that focus on teamplay as well.</p>

<p>Also the point is he wants special infected bots for versus mode.</p>
