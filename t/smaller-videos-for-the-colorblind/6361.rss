    <title>Smaller videos for the colorblind?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/smaller-videos-for-the-colorblind/6361</link>
    <description>Hey there, 

My cousin has Achromatopsia, which basically means he see&#39;s things like a really good B &amp; W tv. He can discern between blue and yellow if their really rich colours aswell.

I have a 200gb + video collection and he wants some, but usually he has to wear special glasses to help him see contrast better

is there anyway I could find a program that makes files smaller for him by changing them to black and white, and or change the contrast to make everything about 20% brighter?


thanks,

YoYo</description>

            <p>my friend spent a lot on a HDTV a while back which contrasts the colours differently, so HE see’s the correct colours.</p>

            <p>^That. Also using the nVidia control panel or Ati(amd) settings you can pump up the gama/contrast or adjust hue settings to get ever further controll.</p>
<p>As for games many casual games could be played, word of goo, eufloria, possibly vvvvvv but not sure how it would play due to the fact that some areas have bright foregrounds and bright backgrounds.(try watching a game play video first?)</p>
<p>Also thinking about your wind water comment psychonauts is an amazing game that should be playable.</p>

            <p>How old is he?</p>
<p>I have a friend who can’t see any damn colors either, and she plays whatever she wants.<br>
I think she adjusts the contrast of the picture via display settings on her computer/tv/projector</p>

            <p>Okay that’s working fantastic thanks alot  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>One other thing, can people recommend any ‘bright’ games that aren’t too childish? From what i’ve gathered, a style similar to Wind Waker would be great</p>

            <p>virtualdub is one of the best, and used by many other converters that are just a nice GUI wrapped around virtualdub</p>

            <p>I am not positive, but I think virtual dub can do that for you. It is free.</p>
