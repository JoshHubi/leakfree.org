<p>When was the last time you played a game where you could strategically destroy every building piece by piece? The answer is never.</p>

            <p>Hi, sorry to bring up an old thread, but in the mission where you are protecting the rocket in the truck via the artillery guns, did anyone else notice that the scrolling text said “Text that you cannot read” or some such thing, or was that some strange glitch?</p>

<p>I got it via Steam, but have yet to get into it as it’s startup logos get stuttery, then it crashes just as it gets to (or just before) the main menu…  I guess I should see if my drivers need updating or something…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I had it crash a ton before I got into the game but now that I am about 10 hours into it (I have pretty much spent my life in it for the last day), I have only had it crash once. This may or may not relate to your issue but it nevertheless should give you hope of uninterrupted destructive mayhem, something we all need from time to time.</p>

            <p>I had it for PS3 for about two weeks, then I sold it to a friend at my school. I really wish I hadn’t. The game is awesome, especially the multiplayer. Someone was sniping from the top of a tower during a deathmatch, and everyone below toppled the tower with team effort and he was crushed under the falling steel.<br>
The story is decent, <span class="spoiler">[COLOR=‘DimGray’]You win, Mars is freed, and Samantha is a wastelander person, who are actually the decendents of scientists and are super advanced, main mission giver is killed by EDF, and you use the power of your nano-rifle to blow a Flamberge-sized ship out of Mars airspace </span><br>
Gameplay is awesome. I would head to a mission point, stop, get out of my car, and set up a trap for EDF headed my way, I raided EDF supplies, then stormed out in mining walker, I blasted the snipers at the top of the building with my X-Ray railgun, I did <span class="bbcode-i">EVERYTHING</span><br>
If you haven’t got it, get it. (unless you are Dias, in that case go back to planning how to prove everything in the world is shit.)</p>

<p>I didn’t care about any of the other available weapons, and I really had no interest in it other then randomly killing people.</p>

<p>Not even the nano rifle that dissolves everything? Kickass gun.</p>
<p>The multyplayer’s pretty fun though.</p>

<p>From the Steam store page for Red Faction 2:</p>
<p>NOTE: Direct X 10.1 ATI video cards or Direct X 10.0 Nvidia video cards are not supported.</p>
<p>I hear there’s a mod to make it work if you have that hardware in your system.</p>
<p>I’ve read that Red Faction 2 was pretty bad though.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have the mod cause I have two 4890s and it works. Red Faction 2s story and gameplay suck, but the visuals and physics engine are pretty impressive for 2003.</p>
