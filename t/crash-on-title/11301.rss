It says loading... then it fatals.. and windows closes the program. no error message or anything.. jsut says the program has stopped responding. Im running windows 7 on a HP g56.. which shouldent matter.. this lappy has been pretty reliable so far.. But any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated.</description>

<p>I managed to get the game running alot more stable. turns out my direct X needed to be updated… interesting considering CSS and HL2:E2 run fine without any qualms. i dont have any modified cfg files, i havent touched any of the SDK base files… The advanced KB menu is still bugged… but other then that… everything seems fine… However… Right after the resonance cascade (unforseen consequences) I can only get as far as thoes poor souls trapped in the elevator that plummets them to their death…<br>
when I hit the button, and the elevator falls it fatals. I managed to enable the dev console and no clipped past most of it… got on the ladder… game froze on load screen… got the autosave loaded it up… and the headcrab scientists textures arent loading. they look like luminecent ghosts… Also… froze when I picked up the crowbar. lots of bugs for me apparently lol…<br>
Also, noticed when objects fly at me… like headcrabs or thoes little bug things the game fatals… pretty much everything fatals.</p>

<p>Still going with the fatals. It seems after no clipping past the elevator scene… the physics or something went to hell… if I hit something… it fatals… like an enemy. if an enemy hits me… it fatals. the models are off… as per screen shot. Right after this door, loadscreen freeze. The game has become essentially unplayable.</p>

<p>Do you have a modified autoexec.cfg in the source SDK base 2007 folder? Delete that whole folder and try launching Source SDK base 2007 by itself before running Black Mesa and make sure the menus are ok with that.</p>
<p>May be the wrong SDK base is being used for the mod, I have SDK base 06 installed also, maybe it’s partially required on some systems.</p>
