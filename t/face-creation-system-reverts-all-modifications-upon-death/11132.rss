    <title>Face Creation System reverts all modifications upon death.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/face-creation-system-reverts-all-modifications-upon-death/11132</link>
    <description>This seems to be a problem with all NPCs who die that use the face creation system to modify their faces - since the system employs the use of facial flexes to change facial structures, it&#39;s on the same system as a faceposing, of course.

...This results in a very [i]odd[/i] glitch, that, while probably minor, just seems weird.

Here&#39;s a scientist from Anomalous Materials, probably the best example of a NPC using the face creation system in the mod, with pictures of him both alive and dead:

Notice it? All the flexes that were increased to change his facial structure have all reverted to zero.

I killed a few other scientists to check this and they all seem to suffer from the same issue.

I hope this post helps with the problem.</description>

<p>Even with different angles, it’s still pretty noticeable.</p>
<p>Unimportant or not, it’s still a pretty weird glitch that could do with fixing (Though whether it’s a priority or not is up to the devs.), because I can imagine the oddity of a NPC with a complex face just suddenly reverting back to default when he dies right in front of you.</p>

            <p>I’m actually kind of disappointed that there’s like 3 or so different head textures and all the flex variations are hardly noticeable. I’ve even made it a little personal mini-objective for my current playthrough to kill every instance of the ever-present <span class="bbcode-i">moustache guy.</span></p>

<p>Scrutiny like the OP’s is exactly what we need in the forums. Replies like yours are exactly what we don’t need. I for one never would have noticed this, but I’m glad someone did.</p>
