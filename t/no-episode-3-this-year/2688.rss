    <title>No Episode 3 this year</title>

    <description>[url]https://www.vg247.com/2010/01/19/report-no-new-half-life-this-year/[/url]

According to the article in the Game Informer, there will be no &#39;Half-Life related&#39; game released this year by Valve.

Most of us already thought so, but now we can be pretty sure it ain&#39;t appearing this year.

The source does seem a little sketchy though.</description>

            <p>I like valve’s attitude towards game graphics.  I personally think extremely good graphics are sort of over kill and a waste of time.  But graphics are an important part of immersing someone into the game experience.  I think valve has found a good balance, and you can pretty much expect graphics to be above l4d2’s level  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>

            <p>I’m sure they’ll add a few whistles and bells to the Source engine when Episode Three comes out. They’ve improved the engine with each episode so far. And what they meant was that they don’t strive for Crysis-level graphics, that doesn’t mean they won’t update the graphics at all.</p>

</aside>
<p>Didn’t someone from Valve at one time say that computer graphics (in their eyes obviously) has reached its peak, making the argument querying “how much more realistic do you expect characters like Alyx to be?”<br>
So I wouldn’t hold out for better graphics in the next episode. Valve has never quenched my thirst for ‘good graphics’ since the first Half-Life.</p>

            <p>I dunno if anyone else has considered this, but maybe (hopefully) they’re working on HL3, or whatever is gonna come after EP3 at the same time as EP3 itself, so after waiting ages for EP3 we’ll have a very short time to wait for whatever is next. I dunno if that sounds any good but it sounds like a nice idea.</p>

<p>How about you post a picture of yourself to show how pretty you are? And while you’re at it, how 'bout you start a video game company and put out a series of bad ass video games that create such a fan base that VG nerds from around the world want to remake your first game in a new engine because thats how cool it was.

            <p>I’ll buy whatever comes next, I just that after all this time, I hope it’s not the exact same stuff as the episodes. It’s pretty stale now, and even more so with the time that’s passed since ep2.</p>

<p>IMO any Half-Life game is justified by a full price tag. I’m thinking this will probably be a much longer episode considering the time it has taken to develop it. In all honesty, Half-Life 2: Episode 3 + Portal 2 would be well worth $50.</p>
<p>Yes I’m a Valve fanboy.</p>

<p>I believe this game could justify a full price tag, only if it is at least as long as Half Life 2 or released as part of a package. In my honest opinion I believe it should be in a compilation with Portal 2, a mystery game and a multiplayer component (Counter Strike 2 perhaps?)</p>
<p>Go on Valve, you know it has to been done!  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I reckon they’re stalling the release of Episode 3 for a reason. I mean, it isn’t going to be released as a standalone game, is it? It’s only an episode, It’s not going to be released on its own. I think that they will release it in another compilation much like ‘The Orange Box’ along with possibly ‘Portal 2’ and another new game to help justify a full price tag.</p>
