    <title>Servers are too busy</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/servers-are-too-busy/4262</link>
    <description>Every time when i try to download any game and play existing (portal) on my mac, steam shows &quot;Servers are too busy to process your request&quot; and i cant do anything. 

Is there a way to fix this?





This Steam thing is getting on my nerves. At first i thought it is a nice idea, but every two weeks there are at least two day when i can&#39;t play anything - because Steam does not works. And when it came to Mac, everything was perfect for a day. And since then, nothing that is connected to playing game works.</description>

            <p>Restart your computer?</p>
<p>If you have a Dynamic IP try restarting your router or whatever to renew your IP.</p>
<p>If both those don’t work reinstall Steam. Remember to actually delete the steam folder.</p>
<p>If none of the above work then I don’t know what else to do, sorry.</p>

            <p>I have expensive and powerful PC, which is in use almost all the day, but sometimes i don’t want to turn on this monster. Sometimes i just want to play something casually.</p>
<p>And first part of my complain about Steam was about working not entirely flawless on PC.</p>

            <p>Well, I don’t see why anyone’d game on a mac. Also, mac’s only had steam for a few weeks now, there’s bound to be alot of bugs.<br>
But yeah, as Brokenfridgehinge said, you should probably get a PC if you’re gonna do some heavy gaming.</p>
