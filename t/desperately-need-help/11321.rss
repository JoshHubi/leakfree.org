    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/desperately-need-help/11321</link>
    <description>Hello. I am having rendering issues with the characters in the game, it&#39;s mainly white spots on characters heads and messed up faces, I wrote about it in the Bug/Ingame issues subforums but noone has answered. 

I am trying to figure out what is causing these messed up characters. One thing that got my attention was that after reinstalling the game the ingame graphics settings was still the same, even ater reinstallation. Are the settings stored somewhere else than in the cfg folder of BMS? I also tried to remove the game from the steam mygames list but I did not find a way of doing that. Rightclicking and closing uninstall or remove game content doesn&#39;t work.

Any ideas? What is keeping the settings? How do i remove the game from the steam list? And is there any config files somewhere else that I should know of?

Thank you in advance. I so want to enjoy this game, but I can&#39;t stare at effed up characters, Dr.Kleiner looks ridiculous. Please help me  :frowning:</description>

            <p>I simply went by what he said in the first post where he brought up that he posted the issue before, and if people were going to help him they would see the first post he mentioned it in. I didn’t bother to look through another thread when he pointed out he mentioned the issue before. How was I hostile? I apologize for not answering your question but I said people will look after it. Gosh</p>
<p>This is what I read…<br>

<p>It <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> be that your PC is having some trouble handling the game, as it occasionally kicks the asses of some of the more powerful computers.<br>
Try this, right-click on the game in steam, click properties, hit “set launch options” and type in “-dxlevel 80” without the quotes. Hit ok and try and run it.<br>
This’ll make the game run… erm, less intensive, and hopefully fix the problem (I make no promises however). Assuming that works you can try changing it to “-dxlevel 90” and that should increase the graphical quality, but may bring the problem back.</p>

<p>Heisenberg. No they are not quite about the same thing. In this post i wanted to know about the savefiles and why settings stick even when i uninstall and reinstall the game and wanted to know if there was any config files or cvars settings outside the BMS folder that I didn’t know of. My other thread was only about the rendering issues I’ve been having. Did you even read my other thread?</p>
<p>And what do you mean by, it will get “looked after” when someone else has this problem? Does this mean that I wont get any help/advice just because noone else has posted about this issue? That doesn’t make one bit of sense when posting in a “Help” part subforum and wanting help. And why are you being so hostile man? U rather rack down on me, pointing out my faults instead of trying to help me, I really dislike that kind of people on forums, they contribute nothing but whining and trying to correct, don’t have any help for my matters? Then please don’t even reply here. If you got something useful for me, please do contribute.</p>

<p>Crypt. Here’s my specs:</p>
<p>Intel P4 2.66 @ 2.9ghz<br>
Geforce 6800GE (asus v9999), unlocked pipes/vertex @ 430/1170<br>
1GB of RAM, pc2700<br>
XP 32bit.</p>
<p>And here’s the settings:<br>
<a href="https://www.abload.de/image.php?img=2012-10-04_00006uvj45.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/3X/6/8/6898898f5945bc73790162bdab86ec999ee705fc.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="eVisVUsddAQACyUexCPF1XVIdC4" width="132" height="147"></a></p>
<p>And removing the mod folder simply was not a final way of removing the mod, as some cvars/config files was still left untouched, which caused problems after reinstalling the game, such as rendering error not disappearing and settings being saved and not reset. Also the game was still listed under “My games” list on steam, even after the so called “uninstallation”. I know this rendering error wasn’t there first when I played BMS the first time, it came after when I started tweaking with the autoexec file or something.</p>
<p>I mean, does this look fun to you?</p>
