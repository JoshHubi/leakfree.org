    <title>Strange bounce bug in Residue Processing.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/strange-bounce-bug-in-residue-processing/13085</link>
    <description>This bug was weird and discovered quite by accident. When Residue Processing starts, when I was sliding down that pipe from the trash compactor into the water... I jumped into the pipe from the top lip. (There also seem to be some weird issues around that pipe opening in the previous map, but nothing that breaks the game.) Anyway, I was crouched, and when I hit the water at the bottom, I bounced. HIGH. Clear out of the map, then fell and died. Doesn&#39;t happen if you&#39;re not crouched.</description>
