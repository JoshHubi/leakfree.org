    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/father-grigoris-ethnicity/9470</link>
    <description>I was just walking along the internet down Google ave. when I came across this mysterious Half-Life 2 file- Well, I thought: Hm? grigdie.wav? Now what could mean, so I listened to it twice, last week, haven&#39;t slept sense then- the noise is stuff in my head... :&#39;(

Now back to the question- is Father Grigori Italian? &#39;Cause when I was playing through Ravenholm, I detected that he had a slight accent.</description>

            <p>As someone said, I personally believe he is supossed to be slavic.</p>
<p>Wether he was relocated from another city or if he had been in 17 the entire war and occupation is anyones guess.</p>
<p>I personally believe he had been there since HL1, started going insane during the portal storms and went completely over once the Combine dropped in the Citadel.</p>
<p>To a religous man that could be quite the sign. End of the world and he’s still there. God must have more work for him after the apocalypse. Who knows, maybe the G-man used this to his advantage with getting Gordon through Ravenholm.</p>

            <p>Grigori is a goofier spelling of the Russian adaptation of the name Gregory. His Voice actor, Jim French, is American. There is no immediate accent in his performance as Father Grigori that can be attributed to any particular nation’s dialect.</p>
<p>Daniel Dociu, the man whos face was scanned for the in-game model of Grigori, is Romanian.</p>
<p>Pick one. Case fucking closed.</p>
