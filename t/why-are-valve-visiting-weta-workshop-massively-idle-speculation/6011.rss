    <description>[url]https://www.systemwars.com/forums/showthread.php?87446-WETA-built-Valve-a-real-TF2-Sentry-and-it-s-fucking-awesome[/url].

So question: why are Valve visiting Weta - you know, the folks responsible for Lord of the Rings and District 9, among other things? Might this have anything to do with a half-life movie...?</description>

<p>As much as I love Half-Life, I wouldn’t see it.  Before LoTR, Peter Jackson made campy movies that weren’t very good.  Including and after LoTR, Peter Jackson made movies that were too long and quite boring.  And I enjoyed the LoTR storyline as a whole.</p>

<p>How about we let Peter Jackson’s good pal Neil Blomkamp take care of it?</p>

<p>Yees, I know it’s about the sentry gun they made. I wasn’t aware major film studios were generally in the habit of making props for people’s lobbies. I was hoping for some massively idle speculation like, you know “OMG they’re gonna make a half-life trilogy with Peter Jackson directing and it’s gonna be in new brain-o-vision, directly beamed into the base of the sensory cortex.”</p>
<p>But no. Well fine.</p>

            <p>For a while, my Windows sound scheme was nothing but Aperture Science turret quotes.  When I logged into Windows, “There you are.”  Error message: “Owowowowowow…”  Close a program: “I don’t blame you.”  Log out: “Sleep mode activated.”</p>
<p>Was extraordinarily cute.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’m not surprised Valve’s visited Weta workshop, if I remember right, Valve hired one of the prominent individuals who worked on animating Golem’s face to assist them in improving their facial animations. I wouldn’t be surprised if Valve has spoken with Weta digital about licensing proprietary software and the like to help improve the source engine. Newell probably dropped by Weta workshop afterword and asked if they might make him a sentry.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t read into anything, though. Right now Weta workshop is probably got their hands tied with The Hobbit preproduction and won’t have time for very many other projects for a good long while.</p>

<p>Yees, I know it’s about the sentry gun they made. I wasn’t aware major film studios were generally in the habit of making props for people’s lobbies.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They will make props for anyone (Replica or Custom) as long as your willing to pay good sums of money for manufacture and delivery.</p>
<p>I was hoping to get money to buy the this full size replica; and who knows, If both Valve and Weta agree to it, we may be able to purchase the sentry gun in the near future<br>

<p>As much as I love Half-Life, I wouldn’t see it.  Before LoTR, Peter Jackson made campy movies that <span class="bbcode-b">weren’t very good.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Whoa, that’s a load of crap. Braindead is an outright classic in the horror genre, and Heavenly Creatures was a very acclaimed drama.</p>
<p>But he still shouldn’t do a Half-Life movie. He would have been perfect as a producer on the Halo movie though. Too bad that deal fell through.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So question: why are Valve visiting Weta - you know, the folks responsible for Lord of the Rings and District 9, among other things? Might this have anything to do with a half-life movie…?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>because it was guys from weta who gave them hints on how to make antlions look this awesome. later, a couple folk from weta went to work for valve.</p>

            <p>I don’t know, it probably means nothing. Valve got to visit Weta, and they asked them to build them a sentry gun. Probably as open and shut as that. There’s a possibility there was another purpose behind their visit but I wouldn’t get my hopes up.</p>
