    <title>Ancient PSU with a slightly less ancient system</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ancient-psu-with-a-slightly-less-ancient-system/6822</link>
    <description>My PSU just died on me so I tried fixing it which naturally resulted in it pretty much blowing up. Figures.

Still not willing to give up I found some old PSU and after some minor rewiring managed to get it to work with my system. ^_^

The thing is, I&#39;m a bit weary about plugging my GFX&#39;s external power in. I need this PSU to last until I get a new one (might take a few days at least), so can&#39;t have this one blow up as well.

The PSU is made by Enlight Corporation and the warranty has ended sometime in &#39;98. It boasts mighty 230W and promises a max of 8A on the 12V rail. :jizz:

There was no 4-pin CPU power connector so I attached one and the MB connector seems to be working fine with 20 pins. There are also 2 7200rpm HDDs connected. The CPU is a 65nm Cedar Mill at 1.3125V and the GFX is a 7800GT which is supposedly content with just ~60W.



tl;dr

</aside>
<p>If your hardware doesn’t get the power it needs from the PSU, it simply becomes unstable or unresponsive.  Your PSU should not blow up, assuming it is a decent brand.</p>
<p>The maths so far say the results will be unsatisfactory though.  You can try it if you must, but at this point you already know what you have to do.</p>

            <p>My rough guesstimation is about 371w is needed. So Im gonna say no.</p>
