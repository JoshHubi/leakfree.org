    <description>ok ive seen mods that im interested on installing but, some are not ready yet, some others have the same idea so i dont know which one is better
but the question is...
why dont you all work together to bring them as a big badass mod?
the reasons

first
as i said there are some that are the basic same idea(on a rail, have already two mods that aim to add the &quot;missing&quot; part of the episode)  blueshift have two remakes for black mesa
two more for the xen episodes(dont know if finished but both are just reskinned original xen maps)

second
the time one have to put to just install each episode

third
it would be easier if the teams worked together to bring the mods, first because you could use more people that already have things done, second, because you could release the mods quicker

but that is just an idea
-_-

            <p>Which mods are doing the same?<br>
I can’t really think of any apart from maybe the sound packs.<br>
All ogf the bigger mods are doing different levels,so why mash everything together?</p>

            <p>Bad idea.Like Crypt said, we all got different styles &amp; development schedules.<br>
If everything gets mixed together, I’m pretty sure everything will become a mess.<br>
Not only in-game, but also if there was a group of BM modders.</p>

            <p>i said it because i still dont think we really need two different version of one or another episode,  i get what you mean, but still, why would i create a mod alone when someone else is doing the same(in a different way) instead of joining together to make it in less time, with access to more ideas, and since some have said that they study/work, it would a lot to have more people on the project, so it doesnt consumes so much time and so<br>
second, i never said “do not release each mod separately”, i said that it would be great if we could have the mods together, yeah i think i forgot to mention that it could be each one separated but i dont know, on the same page or something, so the users can just go, select the ones they want, or download a full pack or something<br>
not that great of an idea but neither a bad one</p>

            <p>I assume you are talking about all the different Black Mesa mods that have been made since release.</p>
<p>Well, it’s very simple, would you be happy if all the GTA IV mods were put into one giant mod? No. Because it takes away choice from the user. Mods are created to add more choice, not take it away.</p>
<p>Also the Xen mod is a temporary solution, using HL1 assets, while we wait for the real Black Mesa devs to finish their version of the chapters.</p>
