    <description>From patch 1.0: *Vorts AI now behave differently depending on how brave or scared they are feeling, which is based on damage taken / done to the enemy.*

This is really cool, and watching the vorts run away is great and really makes them feel like real characters in a world instead of enemies to be killed - but if the player is very close, a low morale will have the vort ponderously turn about and turn their very vulnerable back to the player in which time I have already blasted them. This makes them feel a little goofy, ineffectual, and it breaks the immersion because it feels &quot;off&quot;, something only a weird video game AI would do, since in a real combat situation the last thing you would do is slowly turn around and show your back to the enemy.

Short of implementing a much faster &quot;turn on your heels and run away&quot; animation, I feel that in order to reflect a real &quot;fight/flight&quot; situation, the scared AI should run away UNLESS the player is very close by, in which case they should fight desperately, either closing in for melee or instantly using the &quot;dispel&quot; attack. This would make them feel more formidable and less awkward.

Really minor, but just something I found quite noticeable and immersion-breaking on my last playthrough.</description>

<p>Or, they could fling their arms up to shield their heads and perhaps plea for mercy.  That would be cool too.  I could see an “achievement” for sparing a Vort too!</p>
