    <title>Film Trailer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/film-trailer/4415</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I recently finished a project for my A-Level media course which was to create a fictional film-trailer based on our own characters and plot. The story and continuity didn&#39;t really matter (which is why it&#39;s shit) but the way in which it was edited, the camera angles and the familiar conventions of a film-trailer did. All content had to be created by us, so we made the soundtrack, sound-effects and everything else.

Filmed on a Canon 550D DSLR HD Camera, edited with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects CS4.

Just thought I&#39;d throw it out there and get some criticism.  :wink:

            <p>Alright, the trailer is amazing and how you left the ending is even better! I need to know what kind of camera style it is though. Is it POV? Guerilla? If it’s not POV then I think there is too much footage of that “through-my-eyes” at the start.</p>
<p>Good example of making sure the trailer grabs the viewers’ attention right away. Putting the most mysterious or thrilling or thought-provoking scenes at the start of the trailer.</p>
