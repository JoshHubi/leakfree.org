    <title>Sooo... Patch ETA?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sooo-patch-eta/10648</link>
    <description>Curious if there is a patch inbound for the various issues being reported? If so whats the immediate focus?

The 2 biggest issues I am seeing are performance (especially the least level) and game balance. The balance can be manually changed by the user, so I am not sure if it is going to be considered an issue or not. 

The more minor issues I think are the need to jump crouch for everything and the lack of DX8 support (which I am not sure will even be addressed).

Are there other issues people are seeing?</description>

            <p>apologize for using the wrong word since I’m confused with the wording used in this article as well: <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_2009" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_2009</a></p>
<p>how should I say it correctly? I didn’t say Valve released “Source Engine source code”, what I meant to say was… uh… k nvm forget it, can’t get the wording right.</p>

            <p>Yeah at Easy you won’t have problems defeating the HECU because they do no damage. But they will hit you everytime they shoot and that sucks eventhough they don’t kill you, because then you feel like you’re a fucking invincible robot and not a person. So it would be better to make them less accurate.</p>
<p>Actually that’s the only problem I’ve found so far.</p>

            <p>I think it is perhaps safe to assume the version you played will be the one that goes on greenlight and an immediate update will be applied but what that has is anyones guess but bug fix is a dead cert</p>

            <p>Loved it absolutely. I played it on easy as i do most shooters, they get abit rediculous on the harder settings ive found. I want it to feel like bullets, not ruber bullets with maybe slight lead coating.this is what it feels like on Hard, if u get me.</p>
<p>At first i was abit iffy about the whole sounds and things chanhged but it grew on me fast. I remember putting in some code into one of the files people suggested on the forums was only a couple lines and did seem to make the soldiers more human like. Something to do with making the soldiers respect site cone or something.</p>
<p>Anyway i didnt noticeto  much difference. I liked their BOT AI and amazes me to this day how ai is made. Counterstrike bots are pretty smart i reckon, really love their ai.</p>
<p>By the end of the game when the credits rolled i nearly sheda tear or 2. Thats cos i played Half - Life 1 in year 7 at high school. My friend and i loved it and talked about it every day at school abut our last played thru,untill we finnished it.  We’d help each other out with clues of how to get past the next bit. One of us might be stuck in certain bits. One bit i missed was the scientist whos hanging onto the train platform near the  start of the game. My friend told me to go look out the front door when u get back to the main entrance…You had to break a keypad to open the door.  Now its auto open door a guard and he just falls, oldschool bit was way a scientist and as u walked ontothe station platform to try maybe save him the platform would start to collapse and the scientist would say "No ! - Stay Back! …  GORDON !!!   RAAAAHHHH!!! and fall to his death… made me laugh every time.</p>
<p>Cant wait for a  patch release made by the devs if it even needs it. Im not gonna stuff round with user made change that have no idea what they doin. I just cant wait for some more half life fun. The Episodes are ok but somehow not as cool to me as the Original.</p>
<p>Thumbs upto the mod team u have givin mehope in life again just by playing your great game. Thank You All.  Fans too</p>
<p>PS Would love to seea few things thrown into the knoocks and crannies. Some extra doors openable with somethn in there. And more physics puzzles…  PHYSICS PUZZLES  PEOPLE !</p>

</aside>
<p>That seems like the most sensible idea, tbh. It’ll certainly simplify the patch system as there are still some people who can’t seem to even install the mod.</p>
<p>Will Achievements retroactively convert to Steamworks ones or will we have to get them again? Not that I mind. Any excuse to play it again  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>I feel that people will think every little thing that doesn’t work for them specifically will be a balance bug.  “The enemies are too hard!”  <em>Devs make them weaker and everyone else complains that they were fine</em>  “The mp5 is too inaccurate/weak/strong/real looking/phallic-shaped”  <em>Devs do whatever and everyone else complain they were fine if a person with half a brain used them</em></p>
<p>There are bugs…and then there are petty things that only a portion of the players are noticing.  I admit SOME things need looked into but others need ignored or tactfully handled.</p>

            <p>Okay, good to read that you are considering a patch! I hope this does not affect the development of Xen too much!</p>

<p>Are there other issues people are seeing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the main focus should be on the bugs you named:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance/Crash issues</li>
<li>rebalancing</li>
<li>fix collection of minor bugs (like noclipping HECUs, floating arm gibs,…insert a longer list here…)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe, some people should make a collection thread were the bugs are listed including links to the discussion threads but not discussed anymore, so that the devs (and the community) get a concise bug table!</p>

            <p>Instead of making a new thread, I will post and ask here… how is it that “multi-core rendering” isn’t working? Thought that comes with the OB version of Source</p>

<p>Curious if there is a patch inbound for the various issues being reported? If so whats the immediate focus?</p>
<p>The 2 biggest issues I am seeing are performance (especially the least level) and game balance. The balance can be manually changed by the user, so I am not sure if it is going to be considered an issue or not.</p>
<p>The more minor issues I think are the need to jump crouch for everything and the lack of DX8 support (which I am not sure will even be addressed).</p>
<p>Are there other issues people are seeing?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think we will address them with the steam release.</p>
