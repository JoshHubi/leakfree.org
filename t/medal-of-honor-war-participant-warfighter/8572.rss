    <description>I can&#39;t believe that there isn&#39;t a topic for this yet.

Debut Trailer: [url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRoXqvCz6Zc[/url]

I am pretty hyped about this game,I liked the story of the last one. I hope that they focus only on SP and I really could care less about MP, too many games nowadays put MP as the main game and then SP as a pack-in for the game to seem like it&#39;s worth $60 when it isn&#39;t. Then they make 99% of the achievements SP based so that you&#39;ll have some reason to play it. However, MoH(2010) was actually very good story-wise and I actually got feels in the end. I like how the story is also based off of real wars and battles of modern times.</description>

<p>I’m almost positive he’s referring to “the first one” as in the first of this wave of MoH games. It’s like referring to “the first one” while playing MW3 will most likely be talking about MW1.</p>

<p>:fffuuu: I guess some people like small and reused tubes or new, a bit larger, and well made tubes eh.</p>
<p>No offense, but CoDs campaign is literally so boring that I had to force my self to play it, I mean WaW was pretty good and so were the ones before it, but MW2, 2.5 and black ops were crap.</p>
<p>I already know whats gonna happen before it happens in the campaign, I guess I’ve watched too many movies or I’m just not easily amused by explosions, scripted events, and terrible AI.</p>

<p>Just a fair warning, you will most likely not like the MP and you should try SP first.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s what I would do.  Play as much as I would of the SP (beat it or not) then possibly try the MP before returning it.</p>

            <p>Crysis 2 was pretty fun to play on it, surprisingly.</p>

            <p>isn’t the PS3 controller a nightmare for shooters as it is? The triggers don’t have anything to bump back on. The sudden drop-off makes it feel like massaging a primitive mollusk.</p>

            <p>I played MoH 2010. I ran into a few glitches here and there that annoyed me, but it didn’t have quite as arcadey a feel as your typical CoD style twitch-shooter, which is good. Sadly, the peek n’ lean system was pretty awkward on a PS3 controller. If you ask me, they should go for a Rainbow Six Vegas style cover system for subsequent games in this iteration of the franchise- it just controls better and gives much greater situational awareness.</p>

            <p>I guess you really can’t make a perception on a new game if all you’re seeing is prerendered cutscenes. Despite that, I have a general interest in the series, though I haven’t actually been through any of them, and I hope they keep putting out more of them. Call of Duty really needs some more competition in order for it to change up its game.</p>
<p>Speaking of games that Activision drove into the ground, I’m happy to discover that EA picked up the Tony Hawk franchise with the HD remake of the first two games. It’s the first time in a long time that I’m actually looking forward to a THPS title.</p>

            <p>MOH is a bumpy series. I approach em all cautiously.</p>
<p>Seriously, the franchise has a quality range that goes from “You ought to be in pictures” to “I should have got an abortion”.</p>
<p>This does look like it has some attention given to it, but I feel like we don’t need another modern war shooter on the Frostbite engine. It’s definitely going to be endlessly compared to Battlefield 3.</p>

            <p>Sue me for saying this, but I’m looking forward to Warfighter. I liked the 2010 game, though I found the MP too similar to BF: Bad Company 2.</p>

<p><em>cough</em> Black Ops 2 <em>cough</em> that is all. In fact the only positive is that it might go on the PS Vita and it might provoke my friends to get a Vita and give it good reviews.</p>
