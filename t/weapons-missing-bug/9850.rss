    <description>description:

The game removes all but a few of my weapons on map change

repro:

1. Start up bm_c2a4h (last map of QE)
2. Take the door at the end of the map which goes to c2a5a (first map of ST) which is located directly in front of you at (setpos -249.156311 -5535.410156 -358.125793;setang 3.358535 -87.349045 0.000000)
3. Move backwards so that the last map of QE loads again
4. You now only have a crowbar, glock, magnum and satchels (assuming you had any to begin with). My shotgun, MP5, Tau, and Crossbow are all gone

The only fix is to load an earlier save, or to give yourself the weapons manually.

To do that, type &quot;give &lt;weaponname&gt;&quot; in console.

The relevant weapons names are:

weapon_glock
weapon_shotgun
weapon_mp5
weapon_tau
weapon_crossbow
weapon_357
weapon_satchel</description>

            <p>I got this as well, but kept the crossbow. The shotgun &amp; MP5 are easy enough to get again, whatâ€™s the console command to spawn a Tau?</p>

<p>Just had this myself.  Effected all my save games and am now screwed. Have to start all over because you need that one gun to get through the next section. Fuck.</p>
