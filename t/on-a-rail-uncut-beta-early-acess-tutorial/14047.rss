    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/on-a-rail-uncut-beta-early-acess-tutorial/14047</link>
    <description>* I found out how to get on a rail uncut beta mod from modb to work with Black mesa early access. First download the mod then open the rar file. Take the materials and models folder out of the rar file and back them up. Then delete them out of the rar file. Take the files out of the rar file and make a folder called on rail part 1 (the name doesn&#39;t matter) put them in a folder than make it into a vpk. Then take the materials and models and put them into a folder and name it on a rail part2 then make it into a vpk and install it in the addons folder. That&#39;s it the mod seems to work after doing these steps. It took me awhile to figure out how to do this but it works in the end. Hopefully this will help people and will also get this mod on the workshop sooner. This also works with surface tension uncut and the vent mod but the vent is already on the workshop.</description>

            <p>Excellent that’s great to hear I thought you had cancelled it but it’s great to hear you’re still updating on a rail uncut. I made this topic as a way for people to play the mod while they wait for the newer version.</p>

<p>It’s already finished, I’m waiting for the workshop rewrite so I can upload them. I’m waiting for our programmers to have that done, but we are swamped right now with a thousand higher priority things. It will come, soon enough.</p>

            <p>Another weird thing was that the vortigaunts int the tunnel of the surface trainyard couldn’t attack properly, they would charge up their attacks, but nothing would happen.</p>

            <p>Seems to be working for me, but for some odd reason it changed the smg crosshair to the 2012 version. Does anyone have an idea how to change it back or am I just gonna have to wait for the workshop release?<br>
EDIT:There also seems to be a problem with the music for OAR uncut, the music for the turntable fight does not play.</p>

            <p>It crashes in the free version sometimes as well I think the modder who created it also said there was no way to fix it unless he remade it.</p>

            <p>Ok I just tested out the concept on ST uncut, basically it transitioned smooth but it all of the sudden became super laggy with fps drops, and BMS generally runs fine on my rig, which is:</p>
<p>AMD Radeon r7 265x sapphire 2gb<br>
AMD Athlon II X4 640 Processor<br>
32 gb ram</p>
<p>Then it crashed after a few minutes in the level… happened twice so it must be because of the way the mod’s details were compressed differently than the retail game’s…</p>

            <p>Didn’t he say he cancelled the new on the rail uncut mod or am I wrong? Also I’ve only seen very minor bugs that don’t effect game play like vortigaunts not moving a scripted scene but other than that it appears to work fine.</p>

</aside>
<p>VPK is the file packaging valve uses for its games on source, be it portal 2 or half life 2, atleast for the past couple years after gcfs were scraped. Mods are now used in vpk forms as well</p>
<p>Basically all of the files of the game are compressed into files, saving space. They’re generally located in the steamapps/common/half-life2/hl2 folder (or Black Mesa/BMS in black mesa’s case)</p>
<p>You can view each one individually with gcfscape.</p>
<p>As per this specific method, you’d be making an addons folder in the bms directory, copy the folder from OAR uncut and make it into a vpk (which the tool used to make such is included in each source game in the bin folder)</p>
<p>I myself am going to try this on Surface Tension uncut since OAR uncut still had some bugs in it… Also, if it was a simple case of repackaging into vpks this probably would have been done earlier, I’m thinking Text1FamGuy is making fixes to the ones he intends to release</p>

<p>By the way Text alredy done his part with his uncut mods. The 100 mb limitation is the reason he cant put them up on workshop yet. That problem is going to be fixed in the near future though  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <ul>
<li>I found out how to get on a rail uncut beta mod from modb to work with Black mesa early access. First download the mod then open the rar file. Take the materials and models folder out of the rar file and back them up. Then delete them out of the rar file. Take the files out of the rar file and make a folder called on rail part 1 (the name doesn’t matter) put them in a folder than make it into a vpk. Then take the materials and models and put them into a folder and name it on a rail part2 then make it into a vpk and install it in the addons folder. That’s it the mod seems to work after doing these steps. It took me awhile to figure out how to do this but it works in the end. Hopefully this will help people and will also get this mod on the workshop sooner. This also works with surface tension uncut and the vent mod but the vent is already on the workshop.</li>
