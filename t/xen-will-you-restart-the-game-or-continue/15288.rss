    <title>Xen - Will you restart the game or continue?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/xen-will-you-restart-the-game-or-continue/15288</link>
    <description>Since we&#39;ve been waiting for Xen for so long, i forgot a lot of the game.
So i figured when Xen comes out, i&#39;ll play from start.

What&#39;s your choice?</description>

            <p>I played the mod on release day in one 9 hour sitting (with breaks of course) and then a few more times after that.</p>
<p>I played the Steam version over a weekend and have completed it a few more times too.</p>
<p>I will most likely start from the Xen chapters so I can get straight in to the new stuff.</p>

            <p>I’ll go one better - I’ve never finished BM. Played a lot of the mod version, but stopped short for similar reasons, wanting to play the whole thing through while it’s still fresh. Only played a few hours of the EA version a few different times. I’ve been following the mod for a decade, going to be quite surreal finally playing the finished game through to the end.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When I first finished BM in its original mod form I decided I wouldn’t play it again until Xen comes out so I wouldn’t have to get bored of the main game or get blue-balled by the ending again. Every time Xen got delayed I thought “well… I’ve already waited this long. I guess I can wait a while longer.” And now here we are – five years later.</p>
<p>So yeah. From the beginning.</p>
<p>Nov. 24 edit: LOL.</p>

            <p>I hope the engine update for the old chapters will be released two weeks before Xen is shipping. So we will have enough time to reenjoy the old chapters and are not forced to made a decision!</p>

            <p>I was considering playing from Lamda Core, so that the transition into Xen feels more natural and less jarring. I feel like would I lack the patience to play the entire game from the beginning through to Xen to be entirely honest. I believe having to replay one old chapter right after Xen comes out is more than enough torture for one man to endure.</p>
<p>Maybe I will play the entire game on the same day as the update hits all the way through to the end of Lambda Core, then wait a little for the update to ship, download, continue playing from Xen. That sounds reasonable I guess.</p>

            <p>Don’t wait to play Xen for us, we have no idea when HC will get finished porting, and Xen is much more important to the experience!</p>
<p>The devs have said the engine update is coming out before Xen, but we also don’t know what all the update entails - I know there are some graphical improvements that I’m really looking forward to playing with, but so far nothing around mod support has been announced, and I doubt it’s a high priority for the devs right now since Xen is slated to release in only a couple months. If we’re really lucky, per-map/addon character manifests, choreo, et al. are already implemented, but I expect those will have to wait until next year.</p>

            <p><span class="bbcode-i">In theory</span> the engine update is supposed to come out before Xen proper does, so they could get started on it potentially a few months <span class="bbcode-i">early</span>. However, we’ve not gotten a solid date on that part of the project- people have told me ‘Halloween’, but I’ve not been able to confirm this or figure out where that date is coming from.</p>

            <p>I was always looking forward to play the game start to finish once Xen is out. Much more so since they’ll be implementing dynamic lighting. So it will be fun to look for all the changed environments!<br>
Almost there guys and gals!..presumably.</p>

            <p>Every time the game got updated I would start from the beginning to the end for a whole gameplay. So when Xen is released, I will do the same thing.</p>

            <p>Gonna be playing the whole game again as I do it more than once a year so it’d be an excuse to play it again as well as experience the engine improvements etc. and teleport to Xen as it was meant to be.</p>

The developers have said that they will include a saved game for those that just want to start playing Xen.</p>
<p>I’m going to play the whole game again to see the new changes that they have encorporated into the Earth levels.</p>
