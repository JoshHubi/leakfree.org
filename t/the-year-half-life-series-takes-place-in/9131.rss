    <title>The year half life series takes place in</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-year-half-life-series-takes-place-in/9131</link>
    <description>Although valve intentionally keeps the date of half life series vague, many beleive, in the wake of portal series, half life is set in 1998 (the same year the game was released)

Other debates include half life being set in 2003, due to a page in Raising the bar showing Marc Laidlaw&#39;s draft despicting half life to take place in &quot;March 31 2003&quot;
although many rectons were made (where instead of march 7, gordon&#39;s journey starts at May 7) Its probable half life 1 takes place in 2003 (5 years &quot;in the future&quot; from the game&#39;s original release)

taking into account that hl1 is set in 2003, that would made hl2 take place in May 2023 (assuming gordon was in stasis for exactly 20 years time)


what do you guys think of the setting of half life?
is 2003 believeable?

would it be cool if the mod acknowledged the year setting in some easter egg or scientist diologue?</description>

            <p>It could be that many, many parts of the facility were just outright outdated. The upper management might have decided it would be extremely tedious and time wasting to get all the new tech in and even working properly all that way underground. It might have been more cost effective to simply not upgrade but replace instead.</p>
<p>I know someone who’s electricity company they work at has taken three or four years just to make sure their software wont glitch up on them. With Black Mesa being so much more complicated, I’d imagine it would be a monstrous challenge for them.</p>

            <p>I would prefer a more 90s like style for Black Mesa, with Win 98 computers(or ones that look like them) and all the stuff. That gives us a more Half Lifeish feeling.</p>

            <p>well half life could be set in 2003 because well back in the 40’s/50’s/60’s/70’s/80’s/90’s there were those pop culture trends where anything set around the 2000’s would be considered “futurastic” and this seems to be the case with half life since there is nuclear intervention needed to contain black mesa (remeber that warhead the blackops used in opposing force?)</p>
<p>and even though humanity collasped during the combine occupation, there are still signs of new techology present in the hl2 (circa 2023) world; like that computer-suitcase alyx was using at the beginning of episode 1, and the “ressurrected teleport” of all things</p>

</aside>
<p>That actually does make sense for Half-Life to take place in the late 80’s to early 90’s. Plus, when you think about it, it doesn’t make sense for a government funded research facility to have such outdated equipment (computers on tape reels, CRT monitors, etc) in 2000 to 2009.</p>

<p>A lot more is going to make the game feel dated than just the specific year it was set in. I’d rather it be considered alternate history than forever trying to say it’s set in a not-to-distant-future. Even in 1998 pineapple grenades were too old to be in the game.</p>

            <p>the reason black mesa has alot of legacy pc’s etc. is so players can easily relate the environments to real life counterparts (in 1998) thats another technique that hooks in players in with the “realism” trend</p>

            <p>Gordon was in 20-years stasis between HL1 and HL2. This erased the age difference between him and Alyx, who was an infant back at Black Mesa. I believe it’s canon, I read it on wiki.</p>

<p>We don’t have most of those things now, though. Half-Life is basically set in an alternate universe where science has moved on quicker in some areas than it has here.</p>

<p>It could as well be happening now in some secret USA complexes that are well hidden from the public, we will never know what sort of technology they in fact invented yet. I believe the newest computers we buy are in fact released by secret USA agencies to the world officially as a “new invention”, but in fact these are the computers that they were using already and they became too obsolete for them already, so they release them to world for $$$.</p>

<p>“This is the period during which Portal is set. It occurs a short amount of time after the Combine invasion of Earth.”<br>
I know I was wrong but it was a bit after the black mesa incident</p>

<p>Also, regarding the flat-screen monitors at Aperture, perhaps they developed them early and tested them out in their offices but never marketed them to the public, as they did with the ASHPD etc. This would explain why we see them there and not in Black Mesa.</p>

<p>Where I work, there is some lab equipment run by Windows 95 computers, because the software that runs the machines just won’t run on anything newer.  It’s entirely possible that something similar is the case with Black Mesa, Breen doesn’t want to spend thousands of dollars to replace perfectly good, if a bit old, machinery, when the money could be better spent on some more important improvements to the facility.</p>
