    <title>Bug in bm_c1a3c</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bug-in-bm-c1a3c/11020</link>
    <description>I am not sure if this has been reported or not, I could not find anything about it yet. In bm_c1a3c before the chopper drops the marines down the silo, if you move to the vent to start the process and then move back behind the crates, the marines will not drop correctly. This results in only seeing one of the (and only being able to kill one of them) but they can both see you and kill you.

so far its the only thing I have caught. Awesome job on the game, Ive been waiting quite a while to play this and I am overjoyed I can now!  :smiley:  Keep up the good work!</description>
