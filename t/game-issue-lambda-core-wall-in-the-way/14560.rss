    <title>Game issue - Lambda core - wall in the way</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-issue-lambda-core-wall-in-the-way/14560</link>
    <description>Hi,
I stuck in Lambda core. In one part, the game do not show the loading process and I can not walk into another sector, because wall is in my way.

The point is [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8guGzxX6FHw&#39;]in this video[/url] at 27:10.

In my game, I can&#39;t see crates behind the dead body (nor that body - it appears after loading), [url=&#39;https://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/356148425661518203/1AD54DDFAF673A0ED7523818368F7904ACF7A9B5/&#39;]because of that wall[/url]. But guy in the video can continue without problem.

Can anybody provide more info, please?</description>

            <p>Could be an issue with the game though, rather than a level specific one.</p>
<p>Both in the game and mod releases I could sometimes pass the loading screen at completely random times/levels. Even in HL2 one time. The game would look like it’s loading and after it’s done, nothing actually happened.</p>

            <p>Well, it looks like the loading zone (trigger_changelevel) isn’t working for some reason.<br>
I can’t think of any reason why that particular one wouldn’t activate, since it’s not one of the triggered ones.</p>
<p>Did you maybe use noclip at some point, or some speedrunning tactic that causes you to get up higher than normal? Only thing I can think of that would cause it not to load is that you maybe bypassed it somehow.</p>
<p>Try walking back through the hall, and turn around and go back if it loads the next map at any point.</p>
