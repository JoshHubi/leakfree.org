He doesn&#39;t say it clearly, but he does say, that they aren&#39;t going to continue the episodic model. So we can expect, that Episode 3 won&#39;t be released and that Valve will develop a Half Life 3. Well, I hope so.</description>

            <p>They could always do a prologue at the start of HL3 tying up the the end of the episodic story arc, then have the main game arc be whatever the deal with the Borealis was (say you get teleported somewhere completely different by some Aperture tech on the Borealis).  Then a final epilogue to tie up the overarching story.</p>

            <p>He was asking for Source Portal 2 version not for Source engine 2, and to answer your question maybe they will update, depending if they want,time, and if it will be easier than before … it can cause a lot of bugs.</p>

            <p>You all know why it’s called “half-life” right? It’s cause they never planned on making the rest of it, and “half-game” just doesn’t have a nice ring to it.</p>
<p>I hope you like hats and 2forts, cause TF is next on the rotation.</p>

<p>He doesn’t say it clearly, but he does say, that they aren’t going to continue the episodic model. So we can expect, that Episode 3 won’t be released and that Valve will develop a Half Life 3. Well, I hope so.</p>

<p>I read the article and it sounds very encouraging.  I don’t want JUST another Episode either.  I know a lot of people are anxious for anything Half Life even if it means episodes.  But this will be much better.  Thanks for the tip.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Half-Life 1 did not feature the Combine at all.  It was all Black Mesa and Xen.  Half-Life 2 was all Combine.  Half-Life 3 should not have Combine except as a reference (such as the references to the BMRF); it should have an entirely new kind of enemy.  We haven’t finished with the Combine yet; we need to address that before going to Half-Life 3.</p>

<p>To me, thats a hard sell.</p>
<p>Sure, whoop-de-fucking-do, you found the Boreallis.</p>
<p>But the Combine have mother-fucking starships.</p>
<p>They’ll be back.</p>
<p>Now, transhumans? Ok, you might have something there. I’d like to see more Synths.</p>

            <p>I think they will start with Gordon finding the Borealis, doing something with the huge portal thing that moved the Borealis, and then having to deal with the effects, which should make up the majority of the game. I wouldn’t be surprised if the portal opens up some big link between the Combine homeworld or another alien race’s home planet, and so the majority will be fighting proper aliens, rather than just Overwatch soldiers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think “being done with episodic content” necessarily means that Episode 3 will never come out or that Half-Life 3 will begin directly after the events of Episode 2.  It’s just that they won’t be making any future episodic games.</p>

            <p>That’s not any basis for a pattern though, you’d need more than just two full games to make something like that out. I do think that there will be different enemies in HL3, I don’t know how it will work with the story though, but what I’m saying is there is still no reason for the Combine to not be the main enemies of HL3, maybe some of their other races or their homeworld will come into play?</p>
