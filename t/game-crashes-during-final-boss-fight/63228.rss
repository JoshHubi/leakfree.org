    <title>Game crashes during final boss fight</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-crashes-during-final-boss-fight/63228</link>
    <description>Hey, guys! Great game, thank you very much! Enjoyed every level, and all of them were working just fine UNTIL the very fight with Nihilanth. I was about to finish him off when the game decided to &quot;NOPE&quot; me and crashed. I tried again several times and the issue was still there. That just couldn&#39;t be more frustrating! Download crash files from google drive (as i couldn&#39;t attach them directly to this post) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Srgt4kJrQpKpyN9QYX6g6DPMCnqtaTFo/view?usp=sharing</description>
