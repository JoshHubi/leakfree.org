    <title>The Windows 8 Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-windows-8-thread/8706</link>
    <description>Didn&#39;t see a thread like this so I&#39;d thought I&#39;d make one.  I&#39;d like to start a discussion about Windows 8 since it&#39;s going to hit the shelves in a few months.

I&#39;d would like to start off by saying I&#39;m really scared for Windows 8.  Windows 7 is excellent.  It&#39;s fast, simple, and really has no major issues around it.  Gabe Newell himself even said that he hates what Microsoft has done with Windows 8.     I pretty much do too.  I realize the desktop is integrated but let&#39;s be honest, remember what happened when Windows took over DOS?  DOS was still there until Windows pretty much got rid of it.  But that was really for the better since Windows is far easier than DOS to use.  Now all we have left is command prompt.  I fear the desktop as we know it will eventually be obliterated by the Metro UI for the more casual market.  I may have this completely wrong and Windows 8 may be a smash hit, but if Gaben says it&#39;s bad, it must be pretty suckish.

And I really hate how they took the ribbon layout and slapped it on Windows explorer.  Never really liked the ribbon thing.  Everything always felt too cluttered.  But I guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have been using Windows 8 as my sole OS since the first public beta (DP) came out months ago just because I could.</p>
<p>At first I really regretted it, and came close to rolling back to Windows 7. When the newer beta (CP) was released it fixed a lot of problems I had with it, and really I have no problem with Win8 anymore. It is a little faster than 7, it’s easier in some areas, such as the new task manager (which actually helps more than I thought it would), the new Windows Defender is awesome, it’s nice to have a built-in AV… so really the most annoying thing for me is the start screen.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> The Start screen is annoying.</span> Whenever I logon, it’s there. Everytime I want to run a search, it’s there. Everytime I go to click on the first icon in my taskbar, I accidentally click on the Start popup instead… and BOOM. The start screen likes to fling itself on top of whatever you’re doing and won’t go away until you find the “Desktop” tile and click it.</p>
<p>It happens about 3+ times a day on accident, of course you actually do need to click the Start button if you do need to access the Start screen. And that’s when the start button doesn’t want to appear… &gt; <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>As annoying as it is, you get used to it, it becomes muscle memory to click the Desktop tile, and actually some of the metro apps have been fun and useful.  :s hrug:</p>

            <p>I haven’t run into that, but as I said, very limited experience.</p>
<p>(I’ve set up a few Drupal pages to mess around with, and I’ve set up Alfresco.  Drupal needs PHP and MySQL, Alfresco has everything in the installer.)</p>
<p>Maybe when I eventually redo my shitty laptop, I’ll throw CentOS on it instead of a fresh XP install.  CentOS only because that’s what we have where I work, IDK how CentOS/Red Hat Enterprise rank among linux distros.</p>

            <p>The only reason I’m still a fan of Microsoft is because of Xbox.  Windows 7 is great.  Everything supports it too.  So why spend millions to pretty much port WP7 over Windows 7?</p>
<p>Microsoft really is almost like a legal monopoly.  Yes, they don’t control the PC OS market.  But they have WAY to much power over it.</p>
<p>All stores that sell computers carry Windows PC’s.  Only some carry Macs because they cost more than some cars.</p>
<p>And the issue with Linux is that people who use it must know their way around a computer in order to use it.  That shouldn’t be a problem for any of us here but what about the average Joe?  And there are too many options to choose from as well.  Of course, the only reason that I still use Windows in primarily for games.  But I trust that if Valve can pull Steam for Linux in the right direction (I.E. bringing over all of their games like HL (even the originals), CS, DotA, TF2, L4D, etc. as well as making mod support easy) I think we may see a huge shift in market.  Gabe Newell is already against Windows 8.  So that gives a huge advantage to Linux.  The ball is in Valve’s court and I hope and trust that they’ll make the right move.</p>
<p>I’m about 50% ready for Linux.  All of the applications I use will work or have alternatives, Ubuntu is easy to use, and it’ll cost me nothing.  The other 50% is all up to gaming.</p>

<p>On topic: I have no problems with the Metro UI, it’s pretty much the only thing I still like about my phone, but it wouldn’t be very effective on a desktop PC.  They should have just gotten Android tablet developers to make Windows 8 tablets instead.</p>
<p>If the Steam on Linux thing pans out, (I.E. is actually supported by a majority of game developers) I may eventually switch, but I’ll stick with Windows 7 until I build a new computer.</p>

<p>Exactly.  I know they’re trying to support the newer touchscreen PC’s but as much as people would like to think, touch isn’t the future.  There will always be a place for a keyboard and a mouse.  Will there appearance and general usefulness change with time?  Of course.  But the general idea will always be there.  Windows 8 however would work great on with tablets since it gives a little more control over the device than say iOS for example.</p>

<p>What? When did I ever imply I was a HTML5 apologist? I was just saying that if IE10 supposedly does no support Flash, maybe it’s because they’ve gone HTML5 with it all the way.</p>
<p>I was just as little verbose about it as possible.</p>

            <p>I get the feeling that rather than offer a unique OS they are now just trying to ape Apple.  The reason I don’t use Apple products is because it’s like using (as Rameraziod nicely stated) something <span class="bbcode-b">“designed for use by autistic children”</span>.</p>
