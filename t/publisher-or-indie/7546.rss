    <title>Publisher or Indie</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/publisher-or-indie/7546</link>
    <description>Well what do you think? should a game be published by a publisher (call of duty and friends)? or risk it by going indie (minecraft and friends)?

I&#39;ll pick Indie, yeah there&#39;s no huge flow of money and shit, but nothing beats FREEDOM, That&#39;s one thing that a publisher rarely give chance to a developer.
So there&#39;s no boundaries on how you do it, how long you do it, or are you going to do it at all.

Besides, the bigwigs publishers are money whores anyway (Activision, EA, others)</description>

<p>Indie is more of a get-rich-quick deal than signing with a big shot publisher, at least if you don’t suck.</p>

</aside>
<p>So every indie team that’s not making millions of dollars sucks?</p>

<p>The cool thing with publishers is that most of the time you can get a team of people that know what the fuck they’re doing so your product is sure to get at least a million bucks out of it</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nonsense, the reason they make millions is because they have very large organized teams working 24/7 with a lot of cash for marketing and production itself. Indie developers still need to work a second job to get a monthly income so there’s also a time limitation.</p>

            <p>For most of us there is no choice. We have to go indie. It’s not like there are publishers waiting around every corner that want to publish our games. If you want to make a living in the game industry you’d be much better off working for a studio that has a publisher so that you have a more stable source of income.</p>
