    <title>Sprint boosts long jump module</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sprint-boosts-long-jump-module/11183</link>
    <description>Not really a bug, but it should be changed anyway.

While you run, you jump longer distance with long jump module than with regular walking. I think this is unfair to players who don&#39;t use &quot;always run&quot; option because it&#39;s very impractical to quickly press Shift, Ctrl, Space and W all with one hand. I suggest deleting this increased sprint jump distance. It&#39;s a minor issue in current release, but I suppose it will be significant once in Xen.</description>

            <p>It’s not so hard to drop the lower part of your pinky to hit Ctrl while holding Shift. Hell, I do it almost every time I jump! Besides, the difference is pretty small, and probably won’t make much of a difference.</p>
