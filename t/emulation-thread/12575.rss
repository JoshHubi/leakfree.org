    <title>Emulation Thread</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/emulation-thread/12575</link>
    <description>Since I know at least one of you on here managed to get Metroid Prime running through Dolphin, I figured I&#39;d start a thread about how to emulate games and stuff on your PC. You know, a general discussion thing.

Anyway, PCSX 2 is working out great for me so far, but I was curious about dumping the BIOS on other consoles like the Cube or my Dreamcast. Googling has mostly informed me of how to dump the games rather than the actual system BIOS, and Dreamcast seems to require the Broadband adapter (which is VERY rare). 

(Which reminds me, I should check my local used game shop&#39;s hardware area to see if they have a BBA. I&#39;ve found some rare shit there before, could be worth a look.)

EDIT: Clarification here: DO NOT post download links to BIOS for ANYTHING. The only way to legally obtain one is to do a dump from a console you own.</description>
