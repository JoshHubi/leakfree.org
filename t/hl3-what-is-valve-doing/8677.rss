    <title>HL3: What is Valve doing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hl3-what-is-valve-doing/8677</link>
    <description>Okay so I don&#39;t expect any real answer but maybe just speculation on the matter, however why would half life 3 be taking so long to come out? Is there any information on the webz that indicates what valve has been doing? 

Have valve even touched their product since the end of hl2 ep.2? Is it such a delicate process that they are still working on the story and where it will take freeman? or are they waiting for better technology to make Half life 3 a ground breaking game like half life 2 was in 2004?</description>

            <p>Yeah we really didn’t need another HL3 thread <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>BUT.  I’ll still answer your question.  Valve is working on Half-Life 3 right now as we speak.  It’s pretty obvious.  And remember, there was about six years between Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2 so long waits aren’t anything new to Valve.  They’re just taking their time.</p>
<p>Look at this video.  If it doesn’t say there is a Half-Life 3, I don’t know what does: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPHDi8Z3yVs" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPHDi8Z3yVs</a></p>

            <p>I agree with wanker. Which makes me a wanker too, I guess.</p>
<p>Fun fact:<br>
81% of all men admit to wank from time to time,<br>
19% lie about it.</p>
