<p>Adobe does push Flash for applications programming. They got Flex for coding and the AIR cross-platform framework.</p>
<p>Both MS and Adobe pushes their own RIA tech despite HTML5 and improvements to JavaScript engines.<br>
I don’t think it is going away anytime soon as long as web developers still find HTML5 + JS lacking in either performance or features. And they might be better trained in doing Flash/Silverlight work than HTML5+JS (which is more complex due to various browser differences).</p>

            <p>I’m not saying there haven’t been improvements, I just don’t think there are enough updates to warrant whole new versions of the software. Streamline what’s already available, or make major changes for the next version.</p>
<p>It was a nice update going from PS7 to PS:CS3, but I honestly couldn’t guess at why there needed to be 2 in between versions. Yes, I could do things a little easier, but I couldn’t do anything new particularly.</p>
<p>Saivert: Thanks for picking probably the most useless example. No, I don’t want to brush several layers at once. I do however want to be able to apply filters to multiple layers or style various layers at once.</p>
<p>So, yeah, this is just my opinion and what effects me. Maybe I’m too stuck in the past being happy to create things by hand instead of relying on hundreds of automations, but that’s me. I’m not saying you guys are wrong, and if the changes make you happy then it’s all good, but I’m fairly certain there’s nothing in there that will be changing my life.</p>

            <p>Ehm, Jaycee, if you didn’t see any improvements to their applications since pre-CS to CS3-4, then you’re not using them well enough.</p>
<p>Flash for example (granted, pre-CS(2, I believe) it was still Macromedia) has taken huge leaps forward in terms of workflow and ease-of-use. Photoshop has added a ton of useful features that make the lives of many designers/editors/artists easier (quicker retouching, 3D, content-aware scaling (and now content-aware filling), smarter/smoother workflow (the tabs are brilliant), 3D acceleration, etc.), same goes for pretty much everything, apart from InDesign (and even that had some nice changes, but it generally remained the same throughout CS2-3-4).</p>
<p>I’m one of those fools that buys these packages because I work for a company that has a tight-nit partnership with Adobe, and through said company, I can get some sweet deals. I’ll probably be getting this as well, even if it’s just because of the performance boost it offers, but what I’ve heard and seen, it’ll be worth it. Even if they didn’t change some minor trivial things like linked-layer-styles or whatever (which is pretty pointless and against the way layers work).</p>
<p>PS: imho, Flash is a dead horse in terms of web-technology. I hope Adobe realizes this soon and starts working towards the creation of Flash applications and similar tasks.</p>

            <p>yup. I personally don’t see why you would like to say paint in multiple layers at once. that goes against the concept of layers. you have layers to separate elements from a picture.<br>
the layers combine to form the final composition. this is how PS has always been.</p>
<p>also I like the worksheet/layout presets that has been a part of Creative suite versions of photoshop for some time now. using pre-CS PS doesn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>and if you really only use basic stuff <a href="http://Paint.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.net</a> might be worth a look. but I have found even Paint has some features missing in PS and <a href="http://Paint.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.net</a>. the way you can cut/copy parts of the image and just make a color transparent. in the more advanced programs this requires more steps.</p>
<p>but we all agree to disagree here right?</p>

<p>nice Jaycee. how about a list of changes you want instead.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I work with most of the Adobe suite for a living, and quite frankly I don’t know why they keep releasing new versions other than for the benefit of their bank balance.</p>
<p>Most of the Photoshop improvements seem to be about photo manipulation and retouching, which you can download addons for anyway.</p>
<p>But since you ask, the thing I’d like to see implimented now in PS is that if we can select and move several layers at once, why can’t we apply styles or work on several layers at the same time? You can paste layer styles onto multiple layers but as far as I know that’s it.</p>
<p>I’d like easier movement between Illustrator and Flash too (which I’m sure there will be), and to be honest why not combine the two peices of software now anyway?</p>
<p>Those are the only things that could make my life easier. You?</p>
<p>[edit]btw, I haven’t bothered to read the release notes or whatever information is out there. Feel free to school me on whatever might make a difference that they’re adding this time round…</p>
