    <title>SpeedStorm - Now on Greenlight!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/speedstorm-now-on-greenlight/14831</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
So as some of you may be aware, I&#39;m in a Game Development program at my University where each year we make a game prototype for marks and to fill out our portfolios. This year, in addition to my own team&#39;s project, I contributed some minor feedback and acapella sound effects to a game some friends in the year below me were working on, and they&#39;ve since brought me on to help them continue the project as they gear up to release it on Steam.

The game itself, SpeedStorm, is a fast-paced sidescrolling shoot-em-up, with an emphasis on the player learning to beat the levels as fast as possible through subsequent playthroughs.

It&#39;s pretty arcadey and has well polished [url=&#39;https://www.facebook.com/PlasmaGameStudios/posts/583345731834700&#39;]award-winning[/url] gameplay that&#39;s easy to learn but takes time to master, so if that sounds like it interests you, we&#39;d welcome your vote on our [url=&#39;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=705485961&#39;]Greenlight page[/url]!
