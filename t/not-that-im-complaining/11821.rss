    <title>Not that I&#39;m complaining</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/not-that-im-complaining/11821</link>
    <description>I am soo happy this project is finally done, and I will do what it takes to play it  :slight_smile: 

So far my initial download of the blackmesa.zip containing the 3 files is reported as corrupt by the standard XP pro .zip program.  I am forced to download a 3rd party program, 7-Zip to get the folder blackmesa with blackmesa-setup.exe, blackmesa.7z and the .md5 file inside. I run the setup file and it is taking a very long time to extract but if it is not corrupt I will be ecstatic. Crosses fingers.</description>

            <p>Edit: Ok, next day I was able to install it and play for a bit. I quit and stopped and started Steam and the game is not in my list. I tried the desktop shortcut, “C:\Program Files\Steam\Steam.exe” -applaunch 218 -game “\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS” and it gives error that gameinfo.txt is not in the bms folder when I see it there. It is installed in the default folder as instructed and I still can not play it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Edit: Finally figured it out, at least the desktop shortcut works sans the (x86) and the game starts… not in my steam list yet but as I said, I’m not complaining lol</p>
