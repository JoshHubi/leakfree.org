    <title>Trick Steam Localization for Games</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/trick-steam-localization-for-games/6477</link>
    <description>I hope, the topic name is somehow linking to what I want, which is:

I live in Germany, which has it´s good sides, but for a gamer, it sometimes sucks. 
I prefer english versions of almost any game i get to play, for various reasons.
Steam though knows that I live in Germany and thus when I want to buy games it offers me the german editions, which are often [u]only[/u] german.

Can I trick Steam by using a proxy-tool(like proxyfier) when buying games via Steam so it thinks I´m in America so I can download the english version?
Or will Steam know that I once were in Germany and continue to offer german-only versions?
Has anyone expierience with this?</description>

<p>Even if you buy a game in the USA using your Steam account, when you go back to Germany, you’re still getting the German version of the game.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>wrong, steam locates you by ip when the game is bought, not where it is downloaded, if you bought it from usa/uk and travel abroad and download it say in germany or austrailia you’d download the uncensered verson. and vice-versa</p>

<p>another link</p>
<p>if someone gifts you the game from uk/us it should be fine<br>
(to op you could also buy retail from uk, or a country that has uncensered, and the code to activate will be uncensored too)</p>

            <p>hrrrm I think mr freeman above me may have missed an integral part of this conversation.</p>
<p>I too have heard of this being possible but I cannot find the proper procedure for it right now, however I will keep looking and report back if I come up with anything.</p>

            <p>I know this isn’t helpful but I feel as though I should tell you that doing this would violate the ULA.  However I have heard of this being possible, but live in the US so never needed to.</p>
<p>Perhaps try using this proxy and changing you steam region to wherever the proxy server is located?</p>

            <p>I just got my money back, so I could have bought a new Fallout 3 from an onlineshop in austria, but I didn’t because when I tried to play that game it crashed for me very often.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I don´t have friends outside Germany.</p>
<p>Of what use is a refund there? That way you still don´t have the english version.</p>
<p>I doubt this petition will be taken so serious. At least someone could have looked it through for grammar correction.<br>
It seems like there will be a discussion about it tomorrow, sadly at a time when I´m in school. I hope I can stream it sometime later.</p>
<p>Well anyway, apparently most of the games are available in multilang and the first thing I learned to do with the internet was installing blood patches so problem solved…for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing that out</p>

            <p>ah, right, totally forgot about Fallout 3, I bought it once on steam and asked succesfully for a refund.<br>
hm, well, at the moment there is a online petition asking for a age verification thing to allow uncut games in Germany over services like steam and the replacement of the USK with PEGI: <a href="https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/index.php?action=petition;sa=details;petition=15885" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br>
If you have a friend from somewhere outside Germany you could ask him/her to buy you the game -&gt; problem solved.</p>

            <p>Dragon Age 2 afaik, at least as I looked it up in steam shop last time. Fallout NV also, as far as I remember. I bought it from England. I think every game that is cut in Germany comes out in german-only versions. It´s not like I love gore so incredibly much(I like it as much as anybody else does  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> ) but I enjoy english as a language, the sayings, the jokes, the sound sound of it.<br>
The games I like to play(RPGs, FPS) are just the type which get censored often.<br>
Another reason I forgot to mention was:<br>
Money, we all love money don´t we? Steam(or Valve) loves money so much, it goes for the $=€ course even for download versions. I thought maybe this could be circumvented.<br>
Edit: Just saw that many costs were lowered in the steam shop.</p>
<p>Evidence:<br>
Fallout NV<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/</a><br>
Low Violence: German low violence version only available with German language<br>
Same goes for Fallout 3…</p>
<p>Ok, apparently Dragon Age 2 comes with multi-lang on steam, maybe I mistook that for amazon…</p>
<p>Also: is this multilang-version thing at steam new? I really feel like there were a lotta more games german only the last time I looked into the steam shop, which was quite a while ago. I will look up some more games and if multilang is actually common, my topic is invalid, sorry</p>
