    <title>Scientist Model Tie Glitch</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/scientist-model-tie-glitch/14294</link>
    <description>Hey all, just a small glitch with the ties of Scientists. At any point after you meet Issac Kliener, where a scientist moves more than around a little bit at their devices (i.e. when a scientist will follow, or escort you,) their tie will shake violently; (observe Kliener&#39;s tie, and this will continue as long as this is stared at.)

and after some time, the bone at which the tie is attached will extend into oblivion:

This is only really noticeable when Kliener first speaks to you, as well, I noticed ties will only extend once you meet Eli. The tie will be back in place once you look away and back at the scientist again, but I can only assume that it is because this resets the model. I tested on all model detail levels, and this still occurred, more so on low, I found.

If any other information or evidence is required, just let me know.</description>
