    <title>Game stuck at initial Loading...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-stuck-at-initial-loading/9774</link>
    <description>Installed the game, everything went fine, but when I load it up; I get the blurred background of the initial main menu screen with Loading... in the bottom right.  The game then just sits there indefinitely (Cursor goes from progress to normal).

I tried a few other source games (Half Life 2, CS:S) and those start up just fine.</description>

            <p>I’m having the same issue here, my game has been working fine with a couple of issues here and there and now suddenly it doesn’t even go past the “loading” before the main menu. If anyone knows a fix, please reply!</p>

<p>I am having this problem too. I left it to load for about 15 mins thinking maybe it needed to sort through everything thing but I would really like to play the game.</p>
