Enjoy  :slight_smile:  I added annotations to illustrate what the glitches/what went wrong. Because some are less obvious.

EDIT: I forgot to mention in the video that there is a really bad bug with the &#39;SSAO&#39; when using the Crossbow. For example. When using any other weapon except for the Crossbow SSAO works fine. But when swapping to the Crossbow lots of shadows around objects and walls etc. completely disappear. The game also seems a little bit &#39;brighter&#39; for some reason. Try it. I couldn&#39;t find a good example of it in the video but if you watch closely when I swap from the crossbow etc. to the shadows and SSAO in the game you&#39;ll see.</description>

<p>I’ve seen the bug where the control panel was missing on other people’s computers, it’s not just you, OP.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The bug happened when I died in the room. There was a table there with a monitor on it that disappeared as well as the laser control panel. Wasn’t really a ‘big deal’. What I forgot to show, (or well… didn’t record) was that the console shows ‘re-draw’ errors after you die when it obviously attempts to load the laser control panel.</p>

<p>I had the control panel glitch too - also the blast shield and blasted wall were completely missing, leaving only the drips suspended mid-air. Reloading at the beginning of QE fixed it. I think it’s something related to individual hardware, not really a game issue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well the person below me says he has a Radeon card. I have a Nvidia. I don’t think it’s so much a driver/hardware related issue. But it could be a source sdk 2007 issue, that the devs can’t fix themselves.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve never seen that glitch, but I’ve had problems with the shadows, or shadow-lining (I thought it was SSAO) since I got the crossbow. Starting a new game and sv_cheats 1-ing the weapons creates the same problem. So it is directly linked to the crossbow for some reason. I’m sure there’s something specific about the crossbows coding that throws that shadows off.</p>

            <p>SSAO isn’t a feature of Black Mesa. As such, any issues encountered with SSAO are a problem of an external program (in this case I’m betting nVidia drivers) and isn’t something the devs would care about fixing.</p>

<p>(for example your whole bit on the laser panel missing and stuff, that part worked fine for me and looked awesome</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just because you haven’t encountered a specific bug doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist/is meaningless.</p>
<p>A lot of bugs are hard to reproduce due to differing hardware, game settings and some other obscure differences, so it’s good to see someone is taking a better stance than just “lol i didn’t get that bug so who cares.”</p>

            <p>I watched your whole video, and a lot of the "bugs you show are either your computer, or some problem on your end (for example your whole bit on the laser panel missing and stuff, that part worked fine for me and looked awesome, so I dunno whats wrong with your computer or your install but you should look into that), or so insignificant that they were’t even worth mentioning, I wish Admins would close threads like this, because the whole video was just you basically talking shit about the game, or ripping on stupid little things, other things you show are things that happen in the source engine itself and can also be found in Half life 2 and other source games. Either way, the fact that you composed a 15 minute video to show missing splash effects and talk trash about “bad shadow rendering” and stupid stuff like that is pretty sad actually xD. If you decide to make another one I would make sure you have it installed correctly though or that your computer is capable of running it properly, because as I stated before I saw things in your video that were fine in my game. on a final note I lol at your easy difficulty play.</p>

            <p>I was able to take a picture of the SSAO glitch.</p>
<p>Here is SSAO and the shadows as normal:</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/2/2f0984456f8dd47c5beb0a68b72c3d6cf62ef2aa.jpeg" alt="" data-base62-sha1="6I6PuuEmauXO02up6hgyYXrei26" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>Here are the shadows gone from the corners of walls and objects. You can noticibly see a difference. It really lights some maps up and looks quite unnatural.</p>
