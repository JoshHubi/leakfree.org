Here are the things I&#39;ve noticed so far:

1. The crowbar collision detection seems weird. Face any given wall and swing the crowbar. Now turn to the left or right and keep swinging. Eventually you will start hitting the wall away from the crosshair. In fact, at one point there was a wall close behind me and I could hear my crowbar hitting the wall behind me and to the right.

2. Tripmines do no damage if you pass through the laser against the opposite wall. Seems a little... underpowered.

3. No sound effects play when you first pick up the MP5.

4. The MP5 firing sound effect and muzzle flash are both somewhat underwhelming.

5. The menu screens (such as options menu) are transparent and I feel that it would look much better if they were opaque.

6. The workshop mod that alters the grunt&#39;s voices really improves the atmosphere.</description>

            <p>Well, I saw there was a patch posted a couple days ago and was disappointed to see neither of these things addressed.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are many, many other issues but these seem relatively glaring to me. Especially the fact that the trip mines are so weak. Shouldn’t that be a simple adjustment of a couple variables to improve their damage/blast radius?</p>

            <p>tripmines are hilariously weak, they either need a larger blast radius or less damage falloff, or maybe even both</p>
<p>cause as it stands, there’s no consequence for tripping them (unless you are in the maze in ST)</p>

<p>I’ll post this here because I’m not sure if it’s a bug or I just (somehow) broke something.<br>
Is this normal behavior?</p>

<p>I noticed it both on official SP maps as well as custom ones. <span class="bbcode-i">Player-placed</span> mines work as usual.</p>

            <p>50 views and no replies? Has anyone else experienced or noticed these things or am I crazy?</p>
<p>Or have they all already been reported?</p>
