            <p>Some more Baten Kaitos Origins. I believe I’ve clocked in just over 30 hrs, yet it seems as if I’ve hardly scratched the surface. I got my party pumped up quite a bit though. Managed to grab some pretty cool weaponry through Magnus card trading.</p>

            <p>Haven’t actually had time to play anything since Sunday really, though I did load up HL1 on my piece of shit laptop and played for like a minute.</p>
<p>My laptop is really fucked up, my sister borrowed it for a while, it used to be able to run HL2 on all low settings, I just got it back and it goes as low as 15 fps in <span class="bbcode-i">HL1</span> in intense parts when it used to run it smooth.</p>

            <p>I powered through the game from WGH to FAF yesterday. Granted, it’s not nearly the full game… but I’m a bit rusty right now in my Half-Life Hard difficulty so bear with me.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I remember enough of the game to anticipate the enemy and use the levels to my advantage though. Won a few battles that I would have otherwise lost.</p>

            <p>CS: GO is well worth the investment, though the restrictions on local play are kind of annoying. Not a big deal though as the game is a blast to play online.</p>

<p>Essentially.  They literally spent almost an entire year tweaking and balancing the game.  The results shine through but there’s still some issues as said before. I.E. AWP is still way overpowered.  But basic stuff like hit boxes and recoils have all been fixed and balanced.</p>

<p>Played some Republic Commando after buying it and not finishing it for a year.  It’s a good game.  I like the squad functionality with the exception being the AI…  And I can never figure out how to kill these annoying things.  Seems like they wipe out my entire team even before I notice it’s there.</p>

            <p>I played World in conflict for the first time. I didn’t like it very much. Maybe because there are too many soldiers and the interface is too small.</p>

            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, start your Half-Lifes.  Wednesday will probably be the first time I’m able to start a Half-Life run before the BM release.</p>

            <p>Slender: The Eight Pages.</p>
<p>Holy crap this game had my heart racing. Managed to knab four pages before I met my end.</p>
<p>Though I was having serious lag issues, and my laptop can handle just about any game currently on the market. I dunno, perhaps too many trees.</p>

            <p>Today I played Half-Life on Hard difficulty for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>I got owned by Grunts a few times since at the moment my Half-Life 1 skills are rusty as hell. But I remembered enough of the game to take advantage of things and turn around a few fights that I would have otherwise lost.</p>
<p>Just waiting on Black Mesa now.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I played the Outside game for once in a while.<br>
But seriously though, played Sleeping Dogs (yesterday). It’s really quite fun. I’m afraid however that after I finish the main quest and do most of the side missions that I won’t be able to just dick around in the world for fun. That’s the thing about GTAIV vs. every other open city free roam game ever: the story line for GTAIV is crap but it’s just so freakin’ fun to mess around that you don’t give two shits about the story.</p>
<p>It normally goes like:<br>
“Oh you know, I haven’t played a story mission in a while, I’ll go do one! <em>sets map marker</em> <em>GAAAASP</em> IS THAT A BUS?”<br>
And then explosions happen. 2 hours later you realize that you still haven’t done that story mission. And then you hijack a helicopter.<br>
The cycle repeats ad infinitum.</p>

            <p>I randomly wound up playing a bit of “Infinite Undiscovery.” Now that I have a guide that can actually show me the control scheme (because my low res as fuck TV makes reading HUD/menus almost impossible in this game), I’m liking it a lot more. It’s got a real time battle system that flows better than .hack//INFECTION’s combat system. It’s quite a bit more intuitive.</p>
