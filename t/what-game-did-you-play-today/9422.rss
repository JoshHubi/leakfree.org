            <p>I watched someone’s stream of The Game Awards, where Gris was up for several awards (and won at least one - “Games For Impact.” Played it, loved it. It’s a super-arty, thematic platformer: basically, the kind of game that’s made for me.</p>
<p>I’ve also been replaying Half-Life because it’s the holidays, and I think I might not really be able to play this game anymore. I’ve played it so many times that I know it like the back of my hand, and playing it is a bit like driving to work. I played about 2.5 hours in two sittings and made it to Residue Processing, but I don’t really remember getting there. I guess it may be time to shelve it for a few years and play it again later.</p>

            <p>I’ve been trying out HL2 Update together with MMod. Have to say that it’s a great exoerience and I realized it’s been a very long time since I actually played HL2. I wanted to save it for <em>after</em> BM-Xen, but I ended up playing until reaching Anticitizen One.</p>
<p>Purchased the Witcher Trilogy yesterday for an extremely reduced price. Well, as it very well looks like Xen won’t release in June (at least not the full thing), at least I have something to keep me busy until Xenn will - eventually release.</p>

            <p>Bioshock. First time playthrough.<br>
I tried it a couple of years back but didn’t quite get into it. But I got a new laptop now and it’s a much more enjoyable exeprience.<br>
I’m loving the atmosphere and the idea of building a city on the oceanfloor is fascinating, yet must have been an organisational hell.<br>
Great story so far, and I’m really lokking forward to finish this one and get to the next two. They’ll keep me busy for a while.</p>

            <p>I made it to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996" rel="nofollow noopener">Project AHO</a> in my heavily modded Skyrim playthrough, which is the first quest/new location mod of the bunch I’ve installed.</p>
<p>Bags don’t come much more mixed than this.</p>
<p>The writing is abysmal. The first part of the mod is a bunch of tedious fetch quests for some 2-dimensional characters with middling-to-bad voice acting. For an idea, one of the quests is literally talk to a guy, he gives you a scroll, you cast it; talk to the guy, he gives you another scroll, you cast it; talk to the guy he gives you another scroll, you cast it; success! You complete the quest and get a new spell.</p>
<p>Once you get to the final part of the main quest line, though, the dungeon that I’m currently crawling through is really, really cool. The main hub town is a huge clusterfuck of colors, but the variety of colorful flora actually seem to work in this dungeon, for some reason.</p>
<p>I can’t believe how broken all the English is. Beyond that, I also can’t believe that the voice actors <em>are faithfully reading this horribly broken English.</em> Some of them sound like native English speakers; at some point, you’d think one of them would have told the author/s, “Hey, this line doesn’t make any fucking sense.”</p>
<p>Making a rewrite patch for all the quest descriptions, books, notes, etc., and maybe the subtitles, could be a fun project.</p>
<p>[spoiler]Speaking of bad writing: the premise of this mod is that you’re captured and sold into slavery in a Dunmeri city. Eventually, the leaders of the city offer to free you in exchange for your help saving their city… but first, they mock you for getting caught? I’m playing a pure mage this go-through, so I used alternate start to start at the College of Winterhold and do its questline first, so I’m arch-mage. The leaders of this Dunmer city were saying that they’ve looked into my past, and are wondering how the College is getting on without its arch-mage. Maybe they’ve already replaced me with another arch-mage? Maybe they should capture that arch-mage, as well?</p>
<p>That really puts me in the mood to save your city for you.</p>
<p>I’m going to bring back a couple followers later and murder this entire town of slaver assholes.[/spoiler]</p>

            <p>I’ve got Skyrim Special Edition modded up. It’s the heaviest mod load order I’ve ever put on a Bethesda game. I’m actually really impressed with how well SSE is holding up: the game is super stable and is running super smoothly. That said, I did install a bunch of patches.</p>

            <p>X-COM 2, starting without the “war of the chosen” expansion.<br>
Awesome turn-based action! I loved “enemy unknown” and I really like X-COM 2 even more. There’s a lot of detail into tactical decision making, be it on the battle field or on the world map, or even in your mobile base. Great game! I am  planning a replay with the add-on and may check out “Long War 2”, though I doubt I will have time for that.</p>
<p>Now, if only the Jagged Alliance franchise would fall in such capable hands like Firaxis’… <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/worried.png?v=9" title=":worried:" class="emoji" alt=":worried:"></p>

            <p>Been playing dusk lately, and I’m loving every minute of it. The weapons have a nice, crisp <em>crack</em> to them, Hulshult’s music is amazing, the atmosphere is palpable, the level design is great, and there’s at least a half-dozen flourishes to really round the whole thing out.</p>
<p>I was hoping for a game that was to 90’s fps’s what shovel knight was to late-80’s platformers, and that’s pretty much what it is!</p>

            <p>I finished up the main quest in Shantae: Half-Genie Hero. I ultimately thought it was kind of mediocre. The game ranged from too easy to frustratingly, unfairly difficult. The last game (Pirate’s Curse) was definitely better, in my opinion.</p>

            <p>Played and beat Red Dead Redemption 2 on PS4 Pro. I give it a 8/10.</p>
<p>So… I see a lot of people hyping this game up super high and a 10/10. Don’t get me wrong, it was definitely fun and beautifully crafted but it had some negatives I wanna point out.</p>
<p>First, the pros however.</p>
<p>Beautiful game, graphically. The environment design is gorgeous, I’d spend hours just admiring the scenery as I rode by. Interactions with people feel genuine (mostly) and I loved how you could interact with someone and meet them later and they’d remember it. Animations are phenomenal, some of the best I’ve seen. Pretty much everything has a detailed animation to it that brings the game to life. Customization of weapons, outfit, and hair is great (rocking that mutton stache the entire game). The story was good and really made Red Dead Redemption 1 mean a bit more to me. It was nice to see how the events of the 1st game came to pass.</p>
<p>Now the cons. Sometimes this game draaagggsss. I loved the story and characters and everything but by the time I got the the final mission, I was simply trying to finish. Only to find out the epilogues are like 6 hours long. It’s still fun, but it’s like God damn. Another con is that sometimes the interactions at camp feel… Off. It’s hard to explain but when you play, you’ll notice they feel awkward. I hate the survival aspects, especially towards the end (I won’t spoil anything) when it becomes even more annoying to maintain your cores. Cleaning weapons, while it was cool in the beginning, became a tedious chore. Especially when swamps brought their condition down FAST.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d recommend it. It’s very slow paced, and while people didn’t like the gun play, I did enoy it.</p>
<p>Edit: oh, and there’s some continuity issues regarding Arthur never being mentioned by anyone in RDR1 and <span class="spoiler">New Austin, particularly since an epilogue mission brings you right there to the canyon outside armadillo</span>. That will bother me till the end of time to be honest.</p>

            <p>I’d been off the Undertale train for like two and a half years, but ever since Halloween and the surprise release of Deltarune, I’ve been back on. It’s a lot better than the first one mechanically, and there’s some really nice spritework to boot.</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>wish it wasn’t an alternate continuity though. I get that it’s kind of inevitable but dammit I like my sequels to be part of a SEQUENCE</p>

            <p>Downloaded a mod for C&amp;C Tiberian Sun. „Twisted Insurrection“ is pretty awesome!  I‘m on mission 13 on the GDI campaign and up until now it has been rather challenging but fun! Feels like a proper  C&amp;C game, albeit without the cheesy cutscenes. Mission 13 however had me cringing a lot. You have to protect 10 super slow convoys while constantly being assaulted from all sides. It‘s super frustrating at first and there‘s a lot of R‘n‘R. Had to watch a couple of playthrough to get an idea of a decent tactic. Could‘ve skipped the mission (all missions are available from the start) but I‘m kinda determined to pull through.<br>
Anyway, awesome mod, lot of polish! Definite recommendation for any rts-fan.</p>

            <p>Soul Calibur 6 on pc… ITS AMAZING.  Takes me back to the original Soul Blade and then Soul Calibur for the Dreamcast.  Soooooo many hours spent playing those games with friends.   The last couple of games in the series were not so great, imo.   6 is certainly a return to form.   I’ve played just about every fighting game over the years, the Soul Calibur series has always been one of my favorites.  On my rig it runs like butter at max settings.  It looks incredible, there is a lot going on and man is it FAST.  Not many fighting games around that are melee weapon based, I’ve seen people have been struggling with frame rates online, I’ve not really experienced any problems with the net code, in about 20 matches, ive had maybe 2 frame hiccups.  The net code will just get better, so if you are looking for something a little different, yet competitive, this is a great choice.</p>

            <p>Forza Horizon 4 is fun if you can ignore the avatars and emotes and just race around the beautiful UK countryside.<br>
I’m also pushing Lara Croft around and watching her die a lot in Shadow.</p>
