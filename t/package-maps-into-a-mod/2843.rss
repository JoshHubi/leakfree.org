    <title>Package maps into a mod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/package-maps-into-a-mod/2843</link>
    <description>Hi, this isnt about how to map but how to &#39;package&#39; maps into a game(mod).

If I had 3 maps that are joined together (get from map 1 to map2 to map3.) then how would I put them into a mod? So when I open the mod and click &#39;New Game&#39;: map 1 starts and I can play it all the way through to map 3. (most likely on just 1 chapter)

I clicked &#39;Create a Mod&#39; on source sdk. And I think Ive got the files/folders set up fairly correctly. But I can tweak things once I get it properly working, All i need is to open the mod and click new game and it plays map1.

Im using HL2:Episode 2 so the video that plays at the beggining of the game plays which I dont want.
Thanks.</description>

            <p>I found an answer: - (I asked this question on several forums) so here it is for anyone else with this question:</p>
<p>Originally Posted by l4nd0fc0nfu510n<br>
In the CFG folder of your mod’s directory, there will be files named “chapter01.cfg”, “chapter02.cfg”, etc.</p>
<p>Open up the “chapter01.cfg” in your favorite text editor (I use Notepad++ for CFG files).</p>
<p>Within the file will be something like “playvideo_exitcommand ep1_recap map past01”</p>
<p>What those things mean are…:</p>
<p>“playvideo_exitcommand ep1_recap” - This means, that when you start Chapter 1 from the Main Menu, it will play the video “ep1_recap”, and when it finishes, it will run the next command.</p>
<p>"map " - Starts the map.</p>
<p>So, you can remove the whole video playing part if you want, so that the file ONLY says “map map1”</p>
<p>Assuming you set up your level transitions within the maps correctly, you will be able to get from map1 to map2, and from map2 to map3.</p>
<p>Oh, and put your maps in the Maps folder in your mod’s directory. It’d be like “C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\YourMod\maps”</p>
<p>You can lock this thread now.</p>

            <p>Make a replacement of that video that is blank and half a second long, and place it in your mod folder with the same filename and file path as the original.</p>
