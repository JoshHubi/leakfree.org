    <description>Hello!
I&#39;m currently on the Apprenhension chapter of this great game however when I enter that room where the lights go out and you get &quot;kidnapped&quot;, nothing happens... I&#39;ve killed every other mob in the area and i go in there and nothing happens... Is this a common bug? or have I missed something?

Thanks for help!</description>

            <p>Are you sure you went into the correct room? There’s multiple rooms. The correct one is behind the doors you have to open with the switch.</p>
