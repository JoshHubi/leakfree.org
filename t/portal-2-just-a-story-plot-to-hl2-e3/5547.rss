    <title>Portal 2 just a story plot to HL2:E3</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/portal-2-just-a-story-plot-to-hl2-e3/5547</link>
    <description>So I was thinking about Episode 3 ... The main feature will be the Borealis, or goal if you will, and what kind of lab was it again that produced this magnificent vessel? That&#39;s right Portals own Apperture Science. I think Portal 2 is partially to get the players closer to the Borealis by playing Portal 2, to take this new fact and use it in Episode 3.

Yeah I know that Portal 2 is many hundred years in the future ... But still, don&#39;t you think Portal 2 is gonna have anything to do about the Episode 3 story plot?</description>

            <p>I remember reading somewhere that Portal 2 will for sure not be connected to the Half-Life universe whatsoever, other than the fact that you are in the same complex that you were in in the original Portal. Portal 2 is going to be its own standalone game with not attachments, however slight, to EP3.</p>

            <p>Well, we do at least know the planet hasn’t been destroyed in a few hundred years. Unless of course you aren’t actually on Earth.</p>
<p>Also, it could easily be called a FPS. You play it in first person and the entire premise is based around shooting a gun.</p>

<p>I’m really going to have to disagree with you there. I think pretty much everyone would agree that Portal is a first person puzzler. You don’t have any weapons and the only way you kill things is indirectly.</p>

<p>Isn’t it random, that it’s “exactly” what Valve said in the GameInformer? Everything but the first sentence. They hired the guys behind Narbacular Drop and made Portal, and not if they can make a cool puzzle game, they did it, to make a game with a new principle.</p>
<p>The Borealis exists since 2004 and wasn’t made for Portal 1, but they reused it in Episode 2, and Portal doesn’t take place on the Borealis.</p>

            <p>My theory:</p>
<p>Portal was an experimental game for Valve to see if they can make a cool puzzle game. They re-used Half-Life 2’s engine, and many elements, such as sounds, some elements for the turrets, the energy orb, etc. since they already had all that.</p>
<p>Then, for fun, they figured it would be cool to have some indications about Black Mesa in Portal and link the two universes together.</p>
<p>Then came the idea of the Borealis, and that Portal takes place on that ship, but no reference has been made to this in the games. In EP2, all we know is that there is the Borealis and it has to be destroyed. They have teleportation technology, and that’s it.</p>
<p>I doubt they would eventually link Portal and Half-Life together. They’re about different things, it would not work. Portal is a puzzle game, and Half-Life is a FPS. The link can be present for fun and for easter eggs, but I don’t think they would really let you have the portal gun in EP3, or anything like that.</p>
<p>Portal 2 has been announced, and there was no indication of it being related to EP3 in any way from the teasers.</p>

Many Half Life fans never played Portal.</p>
<p>If you have to play Portal 2 to understand some things in HL2 Episode 3, that’d be stupid, cause some people just don’t like it.</p>
<p>There won’t be more than 1 or 2 very little hints, I think. Moreover, AS is a underground laboratory, the things which happen outside do not affect the things inside.</p>

            <p>they were supposed to be deeply connected but they dropped the idea a long time ago, watch the e3 and pax interviews ffs, they answer all questions, they go pretty deep why there was connection between ep 2 and portal in the first place, there wont be the slightest mention on hl2 story in portal 2, only ester egg stuff i bet.</p>

<p>So I was thinking about Episode 3 … The main feature will be the Borealis, or goal if you will, and what kind of lab was it again that produced this magnificent vessel? That’s right Portals own Apperture Science. I think Portal 2 is partially to get the players closer to the Borealis by playing Portal 2, to take this new fact and use it in Episode 3.</p>

<p>No, no it will not. It may reveal some information about the plot to Episode 3, but it will have no bearing on the plot, 'cause, well, it takes place WELL AFTER Gordon Freeman and Alyx visit the Borealis.</p>
