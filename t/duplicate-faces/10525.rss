    <title>duplicate faces</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/duplicate-faces/10525</link>
    <description>minor issue, and I assume it&#39;s unintentional given how many faces you went to the trouble of making, but I had some dopplegangers. Neither have been carried over from extra areas, one sec guard you save while hes running from soldiers, and the other is the very next guard you meet in the armory. I&#39;m only guessing that you didn&#39;t intend this, so sorry if it&#39;s not an issue for you:

It was amusing however, when one said to the other &#39;nice to see a familiar face&#39;.  :smiley: 


EDIT: On thorough examination, there are some slight differences in hair/facial hair but the faces are very similar. Nevermind.</description>
