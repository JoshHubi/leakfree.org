    <title>Explosions not affecting entities correctly</title>

    <description>A good example is the sleeping 3 houndeye pack in Blast Pit. In 2012 release, a grenade would blast them away from the spots they were lying at. Now, they are gibbed, but remain exactly in the same place. I also noticed this with bullsquids - they remain on the spot, but gibbed. This almost makes the gibbing pointless because they form a full body on the floor instead of bursting in different directions.</description>
