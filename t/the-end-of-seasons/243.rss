    <title>The end of seasons</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-end-of-seasons/243</link>
    <description>TV show seasons that is.

That right we&#39;ve come back to this time of year where our shows have and are about to end.

and we stand on the brink of of boredom 

All of the good shows that have wrapped up this year, namely battlestar galactica

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ka_sHy9cVH0&amp;feature=related[/url]

But the saga of the end of mankind is not over, for the birth of Caprica, that will share the beginning of the story, while although we have seen the end of the story.


The end of Heroes Season 3 had came and went, what was once was a great show with great potential, ended in a crapfest of a 2nd season and 3rd half of season 3, we shall never forgive this, let the show die in peace.


And now Fringe is about too end with the shadowy figure William Bell to reveled (although I know who&#39;s playing him)

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f9a2RQNY9o[/url]

Lost also end&#39;s and how the hell its going to end is anyone&#39;s guess

[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R97E1C0fVUc&amp;feature=channel_page[/url]


Dollhouse has ended, and they gave the fans who Alpha was, and if you were a fan of firefly, you&#39;d enjoy this.

This is all I can give to this thread, share of the ends of your shows to the thread, for it just and wise to do so.</description>
