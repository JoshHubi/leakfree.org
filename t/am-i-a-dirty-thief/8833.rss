    <title>Am I a dirty thief?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/am-i-a-dirty-thief/8833</link>
    <description>The Warehouse (New Zealand&#39;s equivalent of Walmart) sells it&#39;s PC games at ridiculously high prices, around November last year I discovered that for some of the PC games they stock they had left the CD keys clearly visible inside the boxes, probably because of a lack of knowledge as to what those keys are for. This mostly happens with games that Bethesda have developed but occasionally happens with games from other developers as well for example I noticed today every copy of sniper elite v2 has the same &quot;issue&quot;

So since then, anytime a game is released I feel the urge to check there to see if I can get my hands on a CD key without actually buying the game, but I cannot help but feel that it is there own damn fault. They might as well just be giving out free money.

I&#39;ll also mention that they market new releases at around 100-120 NZD</description>

            <p>Your opinion is valid. I’m hating it so far, but getting it through customs was such a hassle that I wouldn’t even dream of returning it (not that I could). I’ve been thinking of selling it off so I can get some cash/Minecraft, so I’ll see.</p>

            <p>ME3 was worth 80 dollars, regardless of how disappointing the ending was. The ride to it was probably the most emotional thing a wad of entertainment has ever done to me and I’m grateful for the experience. twas fucking beautiful.</p>

<p>Well just because you couldn’t be arsed to read about the game before you bought it, it justifies stealing shit? Damn.</p>
<p>I purchased ME3 legit, and I regret it like hell. I didn’t read about it (wanted to spoilers, as if there was anything to spoil in the end… gah!) and now I’m paying the price. Am I gonna pirate everything made my Bioware/EA in sight now? Nah. You need some self control, man.</p>

            <p>Yarr, landlubbers!<br>
Don’t get me wrong though. I support alot of developers like Blizzard, Dice, Infinity Ward, Westwood Studios, Nintendo, Neversoft, Valve, Microsoft and Ubisoft. Even if some of them no longer exist I did support them by buying the game back in the day.<br>
Also if I like a game I’ve pirated I’ll buy it, I just want to try it before.<br>
This is mainly because I have indeed bought some shitty games, for instance MW3.</p>

<p>Fuck you. Just because you can pirate a game doesn’t mean you should, or that buying it is a waste of money. Some people actually like supporting developers and paying for the things they own.</p>

<p>I amused as much that the majority of responses would be something along those lines, but the situation itself is I think has some discussion value, I know a lot of people would themselves do the same given the opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think you meant “suspected” or “surmised” rather than amused. In any case, it’s still classified as theft or piracy no matter how you spin it, since you are taking something without providing compensation. I think what you’re asking though is, is it justified? I won’t pass judgment here, but consider the following:</p>
<p>Arguments for it being justified:</p>
<p>-Carelessness/oversight/stupidity makes it incredibly easy.<br>
-The items are overpriced.</p>
<p>Arguments against it being justified:</p>
<p>-The fault is still yours. No matter how easy something is to do, the responsibility is always the perpetrator’s. A baby is easier to murder than an adult, but that doesn’t mean the baby had it coming. Extreme example, but you get the point.<br>
-Item is a luxury. Stealing something you need but can’t afford, while still stealing, is commonly considered to be at least somewhat justified. Stealing something you want but can’t afford is almost universally viewed as greedy and unjustified.</p>
<p>My $.02.</p>

            <p>it’s clever. the only way you’d get caught is if you were loudly walking around the shelves with a furtive moveset, scribbling into a notepad.</p>
<p>CD keys are usually reusable a few times before they come up as invalid so there’s almost zero chance of causing disgruntlement</p>
