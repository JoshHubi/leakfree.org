    <description>I just realised it was meaningles for Gordon to fight so many hecu soldiers after he figured that they&#39;re bad and killing scientist. Why didn&#39;t he kill one of them and then steal his uniform so he would not be chased anymore. Remember what scientist said ? He said that HEV suit is full of tracking devices so military knows where Gordon is exactly. Why wouldn&#39;t he take off that hazard suit then ? I know the suit is kind of armor for Gordon and it was great protection against all hazards he was in contact with but was it worth it ? Gordon could pretend that he is hecu soldier and pull out with the rest of escaping army, he would be free ! 

Tell me guys what you think.</description>

            <p>Attempting to kill an HECU to steal his uniform would have the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The soldiers usually appear in groups. They work with each other all the time, and if someone isn’t responding to his normal callsign they would know something is wrong. Gordon’s disguise wouldn’t hold up very long, and offers less protection than the HEV suit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attempting to take out a soldier in such a manner as to render his uniform unusable would be nigh impossible. About the only method I could think of would be disarming an HECU, disabling his radio, and then choking him to death with a crowbar, which would be difficult for Jason Bourne to pull off, let alone an untrained scientist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if the disguise DID hold up, he would still have to contend with the Black Ops, because in OpFor canon they’re there to cover up the coverup.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Because GoldenSource was probably not capable of making cut scenes where Gordon undresses a dead HECU and himself.<br>
Also wouldnt you be the biggest asshole in the world if you escaped with the army and left all your friends and colleagues you worked with in Sector C behind?<br>
And if you did escaped, the world would be still invaded by Xenians because you didnt kill the Nihilanth so it would be pretty useless to escape.</p>
