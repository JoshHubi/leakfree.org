    <description>Hi,

I have a problem with guards following me, they follow me, but when u reach a door, I go through it, but the door closes behind me, and the guard stops following me, so he&#39;s not able to open the door, so I need to open the door again, and stay in the doorway, so he can follow me again...</description>

            <p>Maybe it was scripted?</p>
<p>Cause it’s in QE, the guard follows me and I don’t desintegrate him this time  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> , but then he stays in the room</p>

            <p>Curious. I’m pretty sure the default Combine AI can, in fact, open doors. I was VERY surprised when that happened.</p>

<p>I remember that similar glitch in the original Half Life in Office Complex where the guard wouldn’t go through the door, it would close itself and he would stop following you.</p>
