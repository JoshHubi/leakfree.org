    <title>Add the Tentacle moaning sounds please</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/add-the-tentacle-moaning-sounds-please/62560</link>

Why in Black Mesa don&#39;t they even make any noise during the death animation?

I&#39;d really like to see the sounds added before the full official release!</description>
