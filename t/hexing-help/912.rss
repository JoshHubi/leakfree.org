    <description>I&#39;m currently adding new zombie skins to SMOD by hexing default HL2 zombies and changing the locations they look for skins, to make different zombies. They work great... until the zombie gets chopped in half, when the skin/models change back to the default HL2 skin. Anyone know how to fix this? All I did for hexing was just changing the folder names, i.e zombie skin 1 is models/zombeh_classic/classic.mdl and it locates the skin at models/zombie_classic/zombeh_classic_sheet.vtf. 
Any ideas on how to get the hexed models to use their own leg/torso models?</description>
