    <title>Good PC coop games?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/good-pc-coop-games/9103</link>
    <description>As the title suggests, I&#39;m looking for a good coop game (campaign, not a coop mode) to play with a friend. We&#39;ve already coop&#39;d through many of our favorite games like the HL series, Quake, Doom, Hexen, Unreal, etc.

Any good games (or good mods for games) that have coop throughout the campaign? The only one that seemed like it interested me enough to look into was System Shock 2 - but I wasn&#39;t sure about it since it&#39;s meant to be played alone and I haven&#39;t played it through yet.

So yeah, any suggestions other than what&#39;s listed above? And do not say left 4 dead.</description>

            <p>Doom II with a modern multiplayer-focused source port, I recommend Zandronum.</p>
<p>Note that it’s not the easiest thing to set up in the world, but it’s not hard to figure out, either. Once you do, Survival (co-op with limited lives) can be insanely hectic and awesome.</p>

<p>^ this, it was even developed by Valve. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/630/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link</a></p>
<p>really fun to play with up to 4 people. I guess it gets a bit tougher, when you’re just two though.</p>
<p>Does anyone know, if there are some good custom campaigns yet? When I searched some time ago most of what I found was unfinished.</p>

            <p>I agree with Katana, I feel that way too, like in APB Reloaded I always felt angry at the players that were on the “bad guys” side. I’m glad people share my feelings  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>My only complaint with Payday is that it feels very, very evil. I’m okay with being the bad guy when you’re still fighting other bad guys, or you tend to run from cops rather than fight them. In Payday, you’re basically mowing down hundreds of the city’s finest to reach your objective, with no tension or standoff; hostages don’t even matter much. I just can’t get out of my head the idea that those people are all men with wives and children, who do their job to protect people. Other games rationalize that type of thing by demonizing the police (evil police state) but that’s not present here.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re not alone in that feeling. Seems like it’s the minority view though.</p>

<p>Dude those cops are evil though.  They use civilians as cover.  They know that I am trying not to shoot them so they stand behind the civilians so I can’t get a clear shot on em.  That is truly evil.</p>

            <p>Oh, I forgot about Payday, that is a good game.  Its best with 4 players not 2 though.  So if you decide to play it and need an extra player to fill in for it you could add me on steam.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions, though I should have mentioned I’ve already played Portal 2 coop, GoW1, and a few others.</p>
<p>It looks like I’ll be setting up System Shock 2 for coop though, because I actually just discovered I have a real copy of the game, and an unscratched CD.</p>
<p>Also found out that SS2 is made by Looking Glass, which got me excited.</p>

<p>Good examples were posted before i could do.<br>
But i would like to add Battlefield 3 (short but funny) and Armed Assault in general.<br>
ArmA is a great game for multiplayer experience. Especially in realism and difficulty.</p>

            <p>Here are some of the coop games I and a friend have played.</p>
<p>System Shock 2(+Additional custom campaigns [<a href="http://systemshock.org" rel="nofollow noopener">systemshock.org</a>])<br>
SWAT4 (very tactical)<br>
Trine 2<br>
Rainbow Six Vegas 2 (somewhat tactical but lots of action)<br>
Borderlands (not tactical at all, just shoot)<br>
Synergy (many custom coop campaigns, HL2 coop)<br>
Sven Coop (many custom coop campaigns, HL1 coop)<br>
Portal 2<br>
Dead Island<br>
Minecraft (survival, and custom adventure maps)<br>
Sanctum<br>
Diablo 2/3<br>
E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy<br>
Microsoft Flight Simulator X (can be in same plane)<br>
Operation Flashpoint Red River<br>
StarCraft2 (not campaign, but team ladder and custom maps)<br>
Unreal Tournament 3 (coop campaign, Horrible, don’t even try it, lol)<br>
Serious Sam (not sure which to recommend)<br>
F.E.A.R 3<br>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Saints Row 2<br>
Saints Row The Third</p>
<p>Both have full campaign coop, with some of the activities being easier with two players, others being harder.</p>
<p>SR3 runs really well on the PC, I’ve heard horror stories about SR2PC, though.  DLC for both is easily skippable, they don’t add much to the main experience.<br>
(PC version of SR2 didn’t get DLC, and SR3 has compatibility patches if one of you gets DLC and the other doesn’t)</p>

            <p>There’s Gears of War 1, but it’s a stripped down shooter built for the 360. The port isn’t bad with it’s accumulative patches, but I know how people feel about simplistic shooters that focus more on player action than player interaction.</p>
