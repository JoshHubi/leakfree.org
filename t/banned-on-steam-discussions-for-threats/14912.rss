    <title>Banned on steam discussions for threats?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/banned-on-steam-discussions-for-threats/14912</link>
    <description>Hello, I am not sure if this is the right place to ask but I was just banned on the steam forums for apparently &quot;suggesting death threats&quot;. But not only have I never threatened anyone on there but I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve even ever commented on a discussion on there. So I&#39;m not sure why i am banned? Hopefully a mod or someone can look at it. Thank you much</description>

            <p>Sorry that was probably me, the steam reporting is unclear who posted vs reported.</p>

            <p>It seems you were erroneously banned for reporting a post. I think one of the admins must have misclicked on the report or something, accidentally banning the reporter rather than the person reported. Silly us! I have unbanned you. Sorry about that.</p>
