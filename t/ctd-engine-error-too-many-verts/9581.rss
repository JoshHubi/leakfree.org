    <title>CTD: Engine Error &#39;too many verts&#39;</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ctd-engine-error-too-many-verts/9581</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just had a CTD with a dialog box titled &#39;Engine Error&#39; that said &#39;Too many verts for a dynamic vertex buffer Tell a programmer to up DYNAMIC_VERTEX_SIZE&#39;.

This was after entering the little room with the scientist that tells you he&#39;s just received a message from topside in bm_c1a2b at co-ords 409.342896 780.432190 352.031250.
After entering that little room I was getting massive amounts of stuttering and then the crash.

I can&#39;t repro the CTD but I can get it to stutter badly when entering that room. showbudget shows that CViewRender::Render goes though the roof.

Attached the minidump file. Hope this is enough info!

PS. Bloody loving it so far :jizz:
