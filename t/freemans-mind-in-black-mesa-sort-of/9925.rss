    <title>Freeman&#39;s Mind in Black Mesa... Sort of.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/freemans-mind-in-black-mesa-sort-of/9925</link>
    <description>EDIT: DISCLAIMER: This was the start of a (badly-done) remake of Ross Scott&#39;s Freeman&#39;s Mind. [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=ELkznu7Gec_hU&#39;]Check out the original machinima here,[/url] and visit [url]https://www.accursedfarms.com[/url] for more information.[/SIZE]

Also note that although part 1 is made from clips from FM Episodes 1 &amp; 2, subsequent parts are a bit more complete.

I made this as an experiment for fun, and got as far as re-doing FM Episode 5 before calling it a day and shifting my attention back [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHzCdXViwc&#39;]to other projects[/url]. Maybe I&#39;ll continue if there is more interest in the later episodes, or enough people ask me to continue and nobody else has done better at doing this than me.</description>

            <p>I now have Sony Vegas Movie Studio 11 which I learned how to use today - This is the first ever thing I’ve done with it, so I may be a little rusty. After having to put up with Windows Live Movie Maker for over a year no matter how many workarounds I’ve come up with, using Vegas is incredibly liberating in comparison.</p>

            <p>I dunno how I made this work, it just works. I don’t think I’ll be so lucky with future episodes though if I still decide to continue compiling these things. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>Sorry to disappoint you guys, but…</p>

 Ross Scott on his news feed:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve had people ask me if I plan to switch Freeman’s Mind over to the new game. No, I don’t. I think the graphical difference would be somewhat disruptive / distracting to the series, especially if I get to Xen before the BM team does. I originally considered switching over after Freeman blacked out since that would be a smoother transition, but I passed that point, so I’m just going to keep going on Half-Life: Source.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Personally I agree with him - Part of the reason why Freeman’s Mind is funny is because he mocks the original Half-Life’s unrealistic level design, plus Half-Life: Source has a certain charm to it. I’m only making a (badly done) Black Mesa rendition as a fun challenge I’ve set for myself, while not really taking it seriously.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It’d be Nice to see the Actual ‘Freemans Mind’ Voice actor play up to a point in his next episode, before saying something like ‘…did I drop my glasses somewhere?’ Before Proceeding to ‘Pick up’ his glasses, and switch over to his Position in the Black Mesa Mod.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have been hoping for that exact thing, that he should drop his glasses or his flashlight should shut off and that be used as a transition.</p>
<p>Edit: I think he mentioned that he was planning to make the transition during the blackout in apprehension if the mod was out by then.</p>

            <p>Second part is now up! Featuring the resonance cascade:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pxzmwnpZSlo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Freeman’s Mind in Black Mesa Source, Part 03</a>[/SIZE]</p>
<p>The difference between my version and other people’s is that I try and retain BMS’s dialogue and sounds where I can - Even making FM’s audio work with the dialogue, which is hard. Maybe this could use even more polish, but I’m lazy.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a little more complete and thorough than the first one.</p>
