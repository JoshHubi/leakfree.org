    <description>The guards did not receive recoil of the gun. Some items will pass through the other object. Crossbow is not &quot;sews&quot; enemies to the wall, even if they cost her in the face. After the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; in the hallway with the laser, the laser is not quite cutting the equipment. Too much blood ejected from the corpses themselves, even touch them gently (to be in a very strong blow that-be emitted blood). On some skybox naked eye can see the pixels, that is not a clear image. The complex lambda water but not as real. In the last mission if contrive, you can get back to the gate, but the road back will be. I do not know if this is a bug, but in the last mission of the gates had to run out Corporal Shepard after the main character, is not it? :freeman:</description>
