<p>I actually do have Jet Grind Radio on Dreamcast. And that’s what made tagging so annoying in that game. The larger pieces took lots of time, plenty of time for one of those fucking helicopters to shove a missile up your ass as you were putting the finishing touches on the graffiti.</p>

<p>Did you play Jet Set Radio for the Dreamcast? I was talking about where you use the joystick to paint the larger tags.</p>

            <p>I agree with the Shadow of the Colossus posts. The game could have worked a lot better on the next gen consoles or a PC. The PS2’s framerate for the game was fairly low and tended to chug. Emulators on PC can solve the problem if you have a powerful enough rig.</p>
<p>Glad someone mentioned Shinobi III. I’d add Rocket Knight Adventures but there’s a third game that just came out that was very faithful to the first two.</p>
<p>The game that needs the remake the most however is 24: The Game. The reason the game came off so badly is that the AI was bad and the controls were worse. Tighten the controls, put it on a console or PC with multicore to help handle AI processing, add more cutscenes to fill players in on the villain’s side of the story (or more missions, but in either case to make it as good as the show’s treatment of events), completely redo the hacking missions, fix the driving, and put the standard shooter segments in Ubisoft’s LEAD engine used in Splinter Cell Conviction. Might want to add Mark and Execute too, it seems that Jack Bauer’s bullets in the show are practically laser guided.</p>
<p>The Jet Set Radio sequel should be on the 360. You simply do not need motion controls for that game. It would just bugger up the works. They should concentrate on making all the districts one seamless world with plenty of verticality. And I want to be able to make my skater slide under trains, hop fences, etc. with fluidity to evade police.</p>

<p>Indeed. It seems no one really watched the gameplay videos on YouTube. They’re videos of PC gameplay. The reason the game was put on hold until Q1 of 2011 is because brats wanted it on a 300$ console just so they can say they can play it. No way would the people of Crytek let their hard work and dedication go to waste on some measly console rig. If anything, the Cryengine 3 is just more optimized in general. AKA, better graphics, though less demand on the hardware.</p>
<p>To add to this list, I would like to see “Odell: Down Under”.</p>
