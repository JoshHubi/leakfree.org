            <p>I had this issue with my PC when I got some faulty RAM from Corsair.  And my brother also had this issue with his old Windows 98 PC, the motherboard was faulty (intermittent cables or some such).</p>
<p>Not really helpful though, I guess it just shows that this problem could have multiple causes.</p>
<p>When your computer froze, did the mouse lock up as well?  The RAM I had before the faulty replacement I received from Corsair was also faulty (but the PC would boot with it) and it would cause the PC to lock up at random, mouse and everything, with the only way out being to reset the PC.</p>
<p>Do you have any RAM you could replace the 98 PC’s with to test this?</p>
