You may not have heard of Doug Church, but rest assured that he&#39;s had a major impact on our industry. At Looking Glass Studios, he helped create the System Shock and Thief (pictured) series. Later, he was involved with games such as Deus Ex and Tomb Raider: Legend. And now it looks like he may be joining up with triple-A developer Valve Software.

[Update] We received an official confirmation via an email from Valve&#39;s Doug Lombardi. It was short and to the point: &quot;On the record: It&#39;s true.&quot; This certainly seems to be good news for both Church and Valve.

So what do you reckon, will he be responsible for a new IP, or improving Gordon Freeman&#39;s ability to shift his suit into stealth mode? A new IP would be awesome, but I still remember back a few years ago when members of staff said they would be interested in making an RPG in the Half-Life Universe, or even revisit the Prospero IP. Doug could be the key to that.

For those not in the know [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Church]Here&#39;s a list of the games he has helped developed[/url]</description>

            <p>He is indeed. (to Ken Levine working on BSI)</p>
<p>Now here’s some speculation for you. Gabe Newell recently said he’d love to see someone remake Ultima Underworld (I think it was in the Steamcast interview, but it might have been something else). What if Valve somehow bought the long-in-legal-hell rights and tapped Doug Church to spearhead the reboot?</p>
<p>Of course that’s probably not what’s happening, but just the thought makes me jizz rainbows.</p>

            <p>Marc Laidlaw must be thrilled. If I remember right, Thief is one of his all-time favorite games.</p>

<p>Haha, true. But knowing this I wasn’t one hundred percent serious when saying what I did. Plus, Levine is hard at work on Bioshock Infinite…</p>

            <p>Excellent! Any ex-Looking Glass employee is a good fit for Valve. That was the smartest, most interesting game studio of all time. I still play their games and they still feel ahead of their time.</p>

            <p>…I really doubt he’s helping in the making of Ep.3, at most he’ll work on npc’s and other aspects of future valve games like L4D series or Portal</p>
