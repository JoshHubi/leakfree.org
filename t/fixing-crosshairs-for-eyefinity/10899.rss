    <title>Fixing Crosshairs for Eyefinity</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixing-crosshairs-for-eyefinity/10899</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been having a great time playing BMS and it looks great maxed out at 5760x1080  :slight_smile: 
The only issue is that the cross-hairs on everything apart from the round shotgun crosshair seems to have been stretched horizontally  :frowning: 
Is there a fix for this or are there some values I can play with in order to fix the HUD stretch?
It would also be nice to have health and ammo appear in the centre screen and not on the edge of the left and right monitor however that&#39;s not a big deal.
The red damage bars that come up are also a bit weird and overlap each other.

Any help would be great.

Regards,
Wolf</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>while experimenting with some of the console commands I stumbled over two (2) that might interest you:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">r_aspectratio</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">r_aspectratio ???</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> “???” stands for a value (0-5 [+/- .50]).</p>
<p>These could be higher (or lower), but above or below a certain value it appears to make the game (visually) unplayable.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">fov</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">fov ???</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> “???” stands for a value (55-125 [+/- 10-15]).</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Examples (screenshots):</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> “<span class="bbcode-b">v-</span>” and “<span class="bbcode-b">-v</span>” are supposed to be arrows, pointing down.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">v- “r_aspectratio 0” and “fov 75” -v</span><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">You may want to experiment with those two commands, in the console:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">v - How-To enable the console in Black Mesa - v</span></p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li> Close Black Mesa.</li>
<li> Open Steam.</li>
<li> Browse to the Library (All Games).</li>
<li> Right click “<span class="bbcode-b">Black Mesa</span>”.</li>
<li> Click “<span class="bbcode-b">Properties</span>” (on the bottom of the menu).</li>
<li> Click “<span class="bbcode-b">Set Launch Options…</span>”.</li>
<li> Type “<span class="bbcode-b">-dev -console</span>” (without “”).</li>
<li> Click “<span class="bbcode-b">OK</span>”.</li>
<li> Close the “<span class="bbcode-b">Black Mesa - Properties</span>” window.</li>
<li> Start the game.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What they do (presumably):</span></span></p>
<p>A higher “r_aspectratio ???” (higher than 1) seems to squeeze the image, while a lower value (lower than 1) seems to stretch it.</p>
<p>A higher “fov ???” (fov = Field Of View) value increases the overall field of view or visible image, while a lower value decreases it.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Other ways:</span></span></p>
<p>There are other ways, as well.</p>
<p>You could try to edit both the values of “<span class="bbcode-b">xpos</span>” and “<span class="bbcode-b">ypos</span>”, for the misplaced HUD elements, inside the “<span class="bbcode-b">HudLayout.res</span>” file ("[b]…\SteamApps\sourcemods\BMS\scripts[/b]"), but that would require even more testing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">(Remember to make a backup before editing it, though!)</span></p>
<p>Moving the health and ammo display(s) of the HUD is also possible (using those xpos and ypos values I mentioned above).</p>
<p>Don’t forget to preserve “r??” on some values, if there is one.</p>
