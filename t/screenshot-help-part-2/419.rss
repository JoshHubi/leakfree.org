    <title>Screenshot help part 2</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/screenshot-help-part-2/419</link>
    <description>Unlike the other thread, I&#39;m trying to take a screenshot from the original Half Life.  I play it via Steam, but it&#39;s the original HL, not HL: Source.

I hit F5 (which is what it is bound to, and I&#39;ve also tried F4) in-game, and then look at the steamapps -&gt; magical master -&gt; half life.  Originally there was no screenshots folder.  After I couldn&#39;t find any screenshots, I tried making a folder called &quot;Screenshots&quot; and attempted to take the screenshots again, with no luck.

I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m even taking the screenshots in the first place, so...can anyone shed some light on this subject?

Edit: Finally found it.  steamapps -&gt; user name -&gt; half life -&gt; valve folder.</description>
