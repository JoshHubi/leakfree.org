<blockquote>
<p>Sexual Repression: The Root of All Social Control?<br>
“The person afflicted with the emotional plague limps characterologically. The emotional plague is a chronic biopathy of the organism. It made an inroad into human society with the first mass suppression of genital sexuality; it became an endemic disease, which has been tormenting people the world over for thousands of years. According to our knowledge, it is implanted in the child from the first days of life. It is an endemic illness, like schizophrenia or cancer, with one notable difference, i.e., it is essentially manifested in social life.” -Wilhelm Reich</p>
<p>Wilhelm Reich was a radical psychotherapist (and former student of Freud) who, in the 1920s, began to make observations about human sexual repression that we believe have a lot to contribute to the anti-civilization critique. The linchpin of civilization, the defining process that holds it all together, is domestication - the suppression and restructuring of what was once wild and free. In the human animal this translates into the repression and bludgeoning of our natural instincts by outside social forces. Reich believed that human beings formed what he termed “character armor” as a chronic result of the clash between instinctual demands and an outer world, which frustrates those demands. This “character armor” is formed when the ego undergoes a structural change in order to carry out the inhibition of instincts demanded by the modern, civilized world and to be able to cope with the energy stasis which results from this inhibition.</p>
<p>Reich described this change in the human psyche as a hardening, a cementing of civilized repressions that take on a chronically operating, automatic character, as if the affected (repressed) personality has developed a hard shell around itself to deflect and weaken the blows of the outer world as well as the clamoring of unfulfilled inner needs. As a protective psychological formation that has become chronic, Reich felt that this character hardening merited the designation of the psychic mobility of the personality as a whole. The maintenance of this character armor always proceeds according to the pleasure-unpleasure principle and consists of multiple, interrelated layers that serve to ward off the most deeply repressed impulses.</p>
<p>And the most deeply repressed impulse in the civilized world, according to Reich, is the natural human need to give and receive love and to experience orgiastic, libidinal gratification and pleasure. But human sexuality had been repressed and disfigured, claimed Reich, by the compulsory sex morality of the dominant culture.</p>
<p>Reich linked sexual repression to the formation of authoritarian personalities and believed that there are libidinal energies, which are employed in the anchoring of the authoritarian social order, as he explained in his 1933 book The Mass Psychology of Fascism.</p>
<p>Reich believed that it was in this anchoring of the social order in the character structure that we find an explanation for the toleration on the part of the suppressed layers of the population toward the rulership of an upper social class that has the means of power at its disposal, a toleration that often goes so far as to affirm authoritarian suppression at the expense of its own class interests. Reich’s analysis of sexual imagery within Nazi propaganda and Hitler’s hypnotic oratory performances led him to believe that Germans achieved some sort of orgiastic satisfaction from their dedication to the Fuhrer and his weltanschaung of sexual repression. Myron Sharaf, Reich’s biographer, commented that, “This intense libidinal excitation, combined with a sense of moral righteousness, was strikingly similar to the atmosphere at religious revival meetings.”</p>
<p>Reich went on to apply his same critique of the Third Reich to Soviet Russia and the Communist Party, and came to the following conclusions:</p>
<pre><code>o Humankind is biologically sick.
o Politics is the irrational social expression of this sickness.
o The character structure of the masses is formed by socioeconomic processes and it anchors and perpetuates these processes. Humanity's biopathic character structure is the fossilization of the authoritarian process of history. It is the biophysical reproduction of mass suppression.
o The fear of freedom - and the incapacity for freedom - of masses of people is expressed in the biophysical rigidity of the character and the inflexibility of the organism.
o Interest in money and power is a substitute for unfulfilled happiness in love, supported by the biologic rigidity of masses of people.
</code></pre>
<p>We want to make it clear at this point that we don’t uncritically embrace all of Reich’s ideas. Like most visionaries, Reich’s life was riddled with contradictions, and even as anarchists, we regard some of his later writings as marginally crackpot. And despite his advocacy of “free love” and non-monogamy, Reich seemed to be pretty sexually repressed himself and maintained throughout his life that homosexuality was a “disorder.” Nonetheless, we feel that Reich stumbled upon a “piece of the puzzle,” and if we accept that even a fraction of what he postulates is feasible, then it revolutionizes our understanding of how both social domestication and authoritarian political rackets work. Human beings as a species have been deeply scarred and traumatized by 10,000 years of colonization, domestication and sexual repression, and no social order that emerges from this collective dysfunctionality/psychosis can offer us anything but more repression. As Reich described it, “The human masses have become apathetic, incapable of discrimination, biopathic and slavish as a result of the suppression of their vital life over thousands of years.”</p>

By your logic, telling people not to kill people is “oppression” as well. When you’re confronted with something potentially dangerous, telling people not to do it outside of very set circumstances is as far from “oppression” as possible.</p>

<p>Think of it like this: let’s pretend that someone likes to go target shooting out in the forest. As any responsible gun owner knows, the forest is not the best place to target shoot, as bullets travel a damn long way, and there’s always the chance that you could hit a hiker you can’t see. A shooting range is better.<br>
Let’s pretend, however, that you tell people that as long as you check behind the brush to make sure there are no people, it’s safe to target shoot. So, now you and all your friends - the entire world’s population, since we’re talking about sex - are shooting into the forest (holy shit this metaphor is appropriate in more ways then one.) Since they’ve settled into a routine of shooting like this, eventually some people are going to forget to check downrange for people - some may even stop checking altogether. Suddenly there’s a huge danger of people getting shot - all because these target shooters didn’t wait until they were at a target range to shoot.<br>
Sex, even with a condom, always presents a danger. Considering that some of you people are willing to destroy economies and take away freedoms to solve this “overpopulation” problem, I’m surprised you’re so hostile to something that would effectively guarantee a drop in pregnancies and curb STDs - as well as increase a person’s self-control wholesale.</p>

<p>I would hate to imagine how terrible that would have been as well - which is exactly why I’m advocating what I’m advocating. Do you think I don’t want to tell children about how dangerous this stuff is? How else do you think I plan to try to convince people to abstain in the first place?<br>
It’s not the education I’m against. It’s the telling people that condoms or other forms of protection constitute “safe sex.” They don’t, just like checking the forest doesn’t mean that it’s safe to target shoot into it.

<p>The difference is that you were controlling a hunk of metal at extremely dangerous speeds that could maim or kill many people, including yourself. Also, the chance of you crashing depends on your driving skill and reaction time, as well as many other factors. When it comes to condoms it basically just down to the condom, unless you do something stupid and use vaseline as lube.</p>
<p>It’s an utterly ridiculous comparison.</p>
<p>Also, like I said before, you are a virgin and therefore have no idea how people act sexually. Yes, you made your vapid point about statistics but that was about one gender in one specific age and group of people in one specific country, and is therefore representative of only that group.</p>
<p>Teaching abstinence <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> mentally and emotionally damaging. It’s repression, which is bad in itself, but it also leads those to give negative connotations to sex: after all, why would you abstain from it if it was a good thing?</p>
<p>EDIT: Condoms and the pill are pretty damn safe. You’d think that with your apparent love of statistics you would know that.</p>
<p>You know, with your logic you should abstain from eating. Who knows, it might have been infected by a dangerous virus. Sure, it’s not likely that it will be, but why take the risk?</p>
<p>You are a perfect example of a damage caused by repression. I mean, hell, you compared sex outside of marriage with murder.</p>

<p>I highly doubt you can confirm that stereotype. Do you know even one priest? One? I know 30 priests personally and ALL of them are there to serve mass and the sacraments.

<p>What kind of statistics do you want? My point here is that people are inconsistent and irresponsible, and because of this are better off abstaining from this until it can be done in the safest environment possible. Do I really need to prove that most people are irresponsible? Do I really need to prove that people, when told that they can have a good thing, will do it indiscreetly and irresponsibly?

<p>Repression is bad, really? So every single urge you get, you do it, because God forbid you should control yourself?<br>
“Hey, that guy just cut me off. I’ll shoot him.”<br>
“Hey, that girl’s pretty hot. I’ll rape her.”<br>
Obviously you don’t do these things. Very few people in their right mind do, because they come with consequences - <span class="bbcode-b">and people know that, for the most part, they’ll have to face those consequences.</span><br>
Why should sex, which has some pretty damn high consequences, be any different?<br>
As for a negative connotation, I don’t think saying that something is so important that one must be very, very careful regarding one’s participation in it gives it a negative consequences. For example: money is a good thing, but I doubt you spend it left and right on every nice little thing you see. You save it for the things that are important, because you know that it has to be used wisely.</p>

<p>All right, let’s take this comparison a bit farther. Let’s pretend that we’ve got a batch of tomatoes that we know are infested with E. Coli. We know that if we eat them without protecting ourselves, we will get very sick - however, if we use some kind of special pill before eating them, we’ll be okay, as long as we take said pill each time.<br>
Now, are you REALLY going to start eating those tomatoes left and right? Or are you going to decide that maybe you’d rather not chance that the special medicine fail, or that you forget to take it, so you decide to stay off tomatoes for a while until you know it’s safe to eat them?</p>

<p>And you compared sex to EATING. A biological NECESSITY. Obviously sex isn’t necessary for your own life, but that wasn’t the point you were trying to make. I understand this. You should try to understand the points I’M making as well for what they’re worth.</p>
<p>A side note, though: I was comparing ALL irresponsible sex to murder. The only way I can find people having sex responsibly is inside of marriage - a situation in which, ideally, they’d be monogamous, so there wouldn’t be a chance of spreading STDs. Also ideally, they’d be a lot more motivated to prevent unwanted pregnancies: it’d be a hell of a lot harder for a married man to skip town after impregnating his wife than for a guy to do the same after impregnating his girlfriend.

<p>Also, it’s pretty easy to prove that people don’t do good things indiscreetly and irresponsibly. Let’s take food again. Snacks are things people find delicious, they are an enjoyable treat and they’re easy to get. Much like sex (assuming you have a partner). Yet you don’t find people looting sweet shops?

<p>A side note, though: I was comparing ALL irresponsible sex to murder. The only way I can find people having sex responsibly is inside of marriage - a situation in which, ideally, they’d be monogamous, so there wouldn’t be a chance of spreading STDs. Also ideally, they’d be a lot more motivated to prevent unwanted pregnancies: it’d be a hell of a lot harder for a married man to skip town after impregnating his wife than for a guy to do the same after impregnating his girlfriend. Overall, and I say for the third time, ideally, a married couple would be a hell of a lot more responsible than their unmarried counterparts…and this ideal is something we’d have to work for along with abstinence.</p>

          <p>I agree with you on everything, Soup, but not on the virginity thing.<br>
It depends on your experiences, really. I’m still a virgin (though not by choice), but from my experiences and knowledge I’ve gained over the years I think I have a pretty good idea of sexual psychology.</p>
<p>gwgmer, you’re basing your entire point on the assumption that people will invariably be irresponsible when it comes to sex.<br>
You obviously have no insight in how sexual relations work. The pill is something you take periodically, without fail (although forgetting it does happen, sometimes).<br>
Using a condom is something that is easily made part of foreplay or some other part of sexual habits.</p>
<p>And either way, surely, even if people were to be utterly irresponsible, chances of people <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> using a condom when necessary would certainly be higher when they’re not easily available?</p>

          <p>I think the problem gwgamer has is he’s taking the black and white stance of either “Never have sex! Wearing condoms will not help at all and probably make you more likely to get pregnant and get STDs!” or “As long as you wear a condom you can have as much sex as you like and there’s absolutely no chance of anything ever going wrong! Also, we’re going to hand them out without telling you how to use them properly!”</p>
<p>Surely it makes sense teach that if you are going to have sex then do wear a condom, but also make people aware that they’re not 100% foolproof, and teach proper usage?</p>

<p>No.  You were lucky.</p>
<p>Just like all those lucky people that cross the road without getting hit by a car because they look both ways and cross only on the green and in a crosswalk.  Or like all those lucky people that aren’t injured during a lightning storm because they aren’t standing under a tree.  Or all those lucky people that don’t get food poisoning by properly preparing and cooking their food.   :rolleyes:</p>
<p>There are MANY dangerous things you can do out there and, if you’re going to  shield yourself from ever doing them because there’s a possibility that you “might be harmed”, then you might as well lock yourself in a padded cell so NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO YOU.</p>
<p>Hell, eating a bowl of cereal can be dangerous.  What if you choke on your Lucky Charms?</p>
