    <title>Chicks in black mesa source?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/chicks-in-black-mesa-source/13359</link>
    <description>I was watching the black mesa source trailer, when it showed the part when the scientist says, &quot;gordan we have complete confidence in you&#39;. And there was a CHICK in a labcoat standing beside him.

does this mean throughout the game there will be... female scientists everywere?

            <p>You could always play it and find out. And in future, for minor questions like this one, could you use the Questions thread <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=12508" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here.</a> Another thing, I’m pretty sure you meant to write Women in Black Mesa as your subject line, right? Can always change that for you.</p>
