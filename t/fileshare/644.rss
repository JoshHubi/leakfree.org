    <title>Fileshare</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fileshare/644</link>
    <description>Hey, I have a 1tb external HDD attached to a server computer, which also has a printer attached to it. I also have my computer on the same network, so I can access the HDD. The reason I have the printer and HDD attached to another computer not mine, is so that my mother can access the shared drive from her computer.
Now, the problem is, that every now and again (especially if a program I&#39;m running off the shared HDD crashes) the fileshare shuts down until I re-boot.
On the server computer it says something in the system tray about &quot;delayed write failed&quot;.
What is causing this to happen, and how can I stop it?
I was thinking of changing the server machine to Linux, would that help?
Tyvm in advance for the help.</description>

            <p>Most hard drives have esata ports, I don’t know how they work as I’ve never used it, but they allow way faster transfer rates between the computer and the drive. May want to scope those out, and see if your drive has a esata port.</p>

            <p>Uhh, it’s not mine, so I doubt my mother would let me hack it apart.</p>

            <p>External USB hard drive, old pc and file sharing are three things that just don’t mix very well.</p>
<p>I’ve always had problems with external drives anyway, take the hdd out, plug it directly to the PC (if you have a sata port).</p>

            <p>It’s wired, and the server comp is old, so it’s probably USB 1</p>

            <p>Running programs off a shared HDD isn’t a great idea. It’s a much better option to just store files there.<br>
If you have a wireless network, it’s most likely due to a the network connection cutting out. Most of the time this can go unnoticed, but if your computer is accessing files, then it cuts off half way through, that’ll cause issues.<br>
If it’s a hard wired connection, I don’t know what it would be.</p>
<p>Changing the server machine to linux probably wouldn’t help if you’re running windows. It’s just cause more incompatibilities, and sharing files wouldn’t be as easy (depending on what you use).</p>
