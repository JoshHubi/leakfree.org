            <p>When I first saw this thread’s title on the main page, I was like, :facepalm:, and was thinking that it was some kid wishing he or she was a Portal core.*</p>
<p>Then I clicked on the thread and saw it was by Harry-UK and then I was like, :o, and clicked on the link.</p>
<p>Then I watched the video and was all :awesome: and :jizz:.  Great work, Harry!</p>
