    <title>Crash on zone in Surface Tension</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/crash-on-zone-in-surface-tension/14571</link>
    <description>My game started crashing more and more often when doing quick-loads and I finally reached a point where I can no longer progress because each time I zone out of the area where you use the TOW Missile Launcher the game crashes to the desktop a split second after the &quot;Loading&quot; message appears.

It won&#39;t let me upload the save to the forum.  It says &quot;An unknown error occurred during upload.&quot;

            <p>1-3 didn’t resolve anything (I didn’t have any mods anyway)</p>
<p>I’ll try <span class="hashtag">#4</span>, but that seems like a really crap option.  Having to start one of the longest / hardest chapters in the game with nothing but a crowbar doesn’t sound fun.</p>
<p>Edit: Never mind the “nothing but a crowbar” part.  Apparently Black Mesa gives you lots of goodies starting a chapter midstream.</p>

            <p>The following information has helped a lot of Black Mesa’ers<br>
Here is what I would do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the computer. (shutting down and turning it back on is not the same in W8/10)</li>
<li>Next, Verify the game cache. if you don’t know how, ask.</li>
<li>Disable any and all mods, somes mods are broken after the update.</li>
<li>Restart the chapter/level from the NEW game menu, not a saved game. A save could be corrupt.</li>
</ol>
