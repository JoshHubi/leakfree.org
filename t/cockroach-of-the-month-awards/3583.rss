    <title>Cockroach Of The Month AWARDS!</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/cockroach-of-the-month-awards/3583</link>
    <description>Only dev / mods are allowed to post and award a chosen cockroach (new comer to the forums = cockroach status symbol) so this is why the thread is closed. Each month a new cockroach will be chosen by a member of the dev / mod team and will be announced in this here thread.  While there is no &quot;prize&quot; at this time (perhaps in future there will be?) this is still concidered an honored status and all should congratulate the winner with pats on the back and pm&#39;s of praise.

Our first honored cockroach is... (drumroll)
