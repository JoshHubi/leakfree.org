    <title>What does everybody want/do during the Holidays?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-does-everybody-want-do-during-the-holidays/8200</link>
    <description>It&#39;s getting close to Christmas, and I&#39;d thought I&#39;d like to share what I&#39;m doing for Christmas.

Well, what I want for Christmas is Kirby&#39;s Return to Dreamland for Wii, Portal 2, and $50 in my steam wallet.  :smiley: 

I&#39;m also having a Party on the evening of Christmas Eve with my Aunts, Uncles, and Cousins complete with Eggnog and Loadsa Good Eats!


So, what are you guys doing for the holidays, especially the devs?</description>

            <p>Christmas eve will be spent at home with my parents, brothers and in-laws. Lots of good noms, cozy socializing and presents at midnight (presents being: exchange money… Parents give their kids €50 each, we give our parents €50 each… Kind of pointless, but there you go).</p>
<p>Christmas day will be spent on visiting forgotten relatives that have not yet died.</p>
<p>New years eve will be spent with friends in Antwerp. Some more good noms, lots of alcohol and a ton of fun in the form of silly games, videogames (albeit silly) and city nightlife post-midnight.</p>
<p>New years day will be spent figuring out what gutter I fell asleep in and then figure out the best way to get back home.</p>

            <p>I’m throwing a party in my house. Normally, there are supposed to be gals coming to the party. But of course we , guys screwed that part up. Only a few girls were able to make it so we said fuck it and it’s going to be a 7 men sausagefest this year. They’re good guys, though. It should be fun.</p>
