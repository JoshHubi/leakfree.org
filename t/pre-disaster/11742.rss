    <title>Pre-disaster</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/pre-disaster/11742</link>
    <description>Hi there!
I&#39;m fairly new to designing levels in SDK, at the moment i&#39;m just creating rooms and adding things, such as doors, one step at a time.
I seem to recall that working in Worldcraft with maps for Half-Life 1 presented one with the possibility of having the NPCs react pre-disaster. This was done by ticking a box called &quot;Pre-disaster&quot;
Is this possible to achive in SDK? I&#39;ve search high and low across google, and returned with nothing... 
Would some kind soul help me out here?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Depending on which game you’re mapping for, you can probably set stuff like this with an env_global. IIRC, in HL2 it has “Gordon Pre-criminal” which was used to make NPCs treat him like just another citizen in C17 - this was used to the same effect as the Pre-disaster flag in was in HL.<br>
If you’re mapping for BM, I think there might actually be a predisaster setting in the env_global.</p>
