    <title>New sub forum for press/reviews?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-sub-forum-for-press-reviews/10345</link>
    <description>Just an idea.

Would it be a good idea to have a sub forum or stickied thread to collect all the various press about BM that are popping up? I find it really interesting considering the time the mod/game has taken and its interesting to see the world explode !

I think it would be a good idea, like a database of links/reviews/videos.
Suppose i&#39;m kinda proud of the dev&#39;s and like to see how places are reacting now BM is actually with us. I hope to hear/see from Valve at some time, i&#39;d love to hear their view on BM.. I hope they were as impressed as most of us were and its maybe inspired some people to get together and think about HL3  :wink: 

Cheers
