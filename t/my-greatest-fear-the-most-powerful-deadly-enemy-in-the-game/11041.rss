    <description>THE LADDERS!

They terrify me.  Nothing sends cold shivers down my spine like dismounting from a ladder over a deadly drop.</description>

            <p>Señores, even me, the person who doesn’t play this kind of games (Black Mesa is exception), had no problems with ladders. “E” to grab it, “E” or jump to let it go.</p>

            <p>Oh my sweet summer child, what do you know of fear? Fear is for the Dentons. When the ladders fling you from rooftops from the slightest errors. When both of your legs are down to zero HP and you’ve run out of medkits and just want an NSF trooper to come by and put you out of your misery.</p>

            <p>Half-Life 1 Ladders &gt; Any Other Ladder</p>
<p>Simply because there’s a chance you can clip through the ladder and not grab onto it at all, so you just fall all the way down. I died a good amount of times from that.</p>

            <p>I think you could turn around 180 degrees while on a ladder in the original and stay connected to the ladder until you decided to jump off. Maybe this is what makes dismounting ladders so weird in black mesa because you’re still slightly looking at the ladder when trying to get off so it just re-mounts it?</p>

            <p>I agree. It seems super simple. When near the ladder, press the use key and you get sucked onto the ladder. When you get to the point you want to get off you can just hit jump.<br>
The one thing about ladders that is tricky is when you are jumping towards the ladder. If you come at it from and angle, you are doomed.</p>

            <p>I think the “E” key worked in the original Half-Life as well. I still managed to forget it many times and more often than not, when dismounting at the top of a ladder to a ledge, I would just fall off and crash to my death (or suffer severe bone fractures).</p>
<p>In Black Mesa, I’ve had this happen less times so far, although at one point where there is some slippery floor near an open elevator shaft, I tried repeatedly to jump and grab on to a ladder (which ultimately I think you can’t or not supposed to do, due to some enofrced collisions) and I died so many times it wasn’t even funny in the end.</p>
