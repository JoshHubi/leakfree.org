    <description>They suck. I&#39;ve been trying to wrap my head around this whole system, and people have told me that you need to edit .gcf files, which I can&#39;t even find, and you need to have an info_particle_system, and so on. So far what I&#39;ve done is follow [url=https://www.interlopers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=26856&amp;sid=658248795d635729a9ae5386e833609b&amp;start=15]this[/url] tutorial as far as I could (I&#39;m trying to make a water droplet effect so my properties are a little different), and I&#39;m using the in-game particle editor thing (which is quite neat).

Now my problem is this: How the hell do I a) place the actual effect where I want to, and b) change its properties such as how fast it falls and how often?</description>

            <p>You, sir, are my hero. That was perfect. If I have questions about mapping, would you be overly enraged if I were to PM you with questions? I won’t bother you for stupid little things and I will be sure to scour the web for what I need before bothering you.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Okay, it makes more sense now. I can’t have one thing pointing at multiple other things of different types. I just have to make them target each other when they’re fired. Okay, similar to JA.</p>
<p>Now, since this thread is a-rollin’, how do I go about making those neat switches with props that animate, such as the one where you throw a lever and when it connects sparks fly and it fires its trigger? I looked all over the net and the valve developer community and I can’t find anything. I don’t want to use that god-awful static red button texture that valve has.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Oh, I tried func_rot_button, which seems perfect, but that’s only for brushes. It won’t let me use the lever handle prop as a button.]</p>

            <p>you need to extract the particlesmanifest.txt and add you file to the list<br>
and you can change the speed of the fall down in movement basic by changing the gravity on the z-axis and you can change the emit count in the emitter properties</p>
