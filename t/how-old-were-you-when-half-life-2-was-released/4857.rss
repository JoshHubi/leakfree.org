            <p>Jesus has it really been that long!? I was in college, aged 17. I remember the day before it was released I was checked every GAME store in my local area and none of them had any copies available due to pre-orders.</p>
<p>Ordered it on <a href="http://play.com" rel="nofollow noopener">play.com</a> and it arrived 2 days later. Then I realised that not a single PC in my house would run it above low settings. Didn’t care. Finished it in a week.</p>
<p>1 Year later I got a PC capable of max settings. Played again. Mind = blown.</p>
<p>… oops. Longer than intended post is longer than intended.</p>
<p>So yeah, 17.</p>
