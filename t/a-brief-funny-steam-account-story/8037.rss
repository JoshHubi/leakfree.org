    <title>A Brief Funny Steam Account Story</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/a-brief-funny-steam-account-story/8037</link>
    <description>So I tried to log onto my steam account for the first time in a year or so a few months ago, only to find that I couldn&#39;t. I contacted Steam Support, and after a week or so of messages back and fourth, I finally got my account back. Shortly after logging on and changing my security question and password, some geezer called tOny MOVIE BOY ! =D messaged me complaining that I was logged onto his account. He had bought it for $20 from a website called steambuy.com.

He&#39;s got a big tournament tomorrow, and is begging for it back.

            <p>It’s not allowed to buy someone’s account. This “Steambuy” site is likely illegal, and the OP should notify Valve of it’s existence. I’m thinking that people hack accounts (probably from the old ‘link to a page that looks like the steam login’ IM trick) then sell the usernames and passwords on the site.<br>
I had a friend that almost had that happen to him, but he caught it and changed his password right away.</p>

            <p>Is it allowed here to buy somebody else’s account just for the game. Although he hasn’t been using it for less than a year doesn’t mean that he is not into the game anymore.I’m just curious…</p>

<p>It is. I thought it said. “Off Topic” not “Show Off.” <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>I dunno though…I don’t think he’s very good, he ruined my stats. I guess he bought it for the games, I’ve got 17.</p>

            <p>Sucks to be him then. :retard:</p>
<p>Why the hell would he need to buy a steam account anyways? Was if for a the games on your account? Did he need a game there for that tournament? And if that’s the problem, why didn’t he just use his own account to buy that game, since he was still able to contact you? And how the fuck do you become competitive in a game you owned for less than a year? Unless he had past experience in that game, which means he already owned the game and had no reason to buy your account!</p>
<p>GAH!</p>
