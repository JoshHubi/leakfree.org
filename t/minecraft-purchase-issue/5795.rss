    <title>Minecraft purchase issue</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/minecraft-purchase-issue/5795</link>
    <description>Okay, I don&#39;t have a credit card or access to one that I can borrow at the moment, so I bought a Vanilla Visa gift card. I have never had a problem with one before until I tried to buy Minecraft. I validated the card with PayPal, they took the $1.50 off my card, I entered the code that I got, and works. Problem is, it works for everything EXCEPT buying Minecraft, which is really making me want to scream. I&#39;ve looked at Vanilla Visa&#39;s FAQ&#39;s and I&#39;ve contacted them for help. I have looked at PayPal&#39;s FAQ and contacted them for help. Both parties say they have no clue what&#39;s wrong and that I&#39;m basically S.O.L. So I come to you. CAN SOMEONE HERE PLEASE HELP ME? I really want to buy the game.</description>

<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Its because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>paypal has marked them as people who might ask for a refund. Possibly because they asked for a chargeback at some point in history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike most sites, Mojang has their payapl integration set to the absolute maximum so it will reject anyone at the slightest cause. They may do this  because little kids keep using their parents card and then the parents do a chargeback. They don’t want these kids or their parents. At any rate, any user who has ever asked for a single charge back in their lives, whether legitimate or not, will be rejected.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Paypal and moneybrokers share this information so using another system wont help.</li>
<li>You can not actually delete an account with either paypal or moneybrokers.</li>
<li>There is no way to complain about their erroneous rating of you or even see it (unless you create you own merchant account and set up a paypal integration and try to buy something from yourself (which what I do for a living))</li>
<li>Mojang is not going to change their policy and, since it’s like 5 guys, probably don’t remember they set it up this way. And anyway don’t care too much since it’s only a small percent of people.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could try to create a another account but if you use the same credit card number, email address, physical address or phone number you will be immediately tagged. Browser and flash cookies will also be used to tag you and maybe some paypal buggy heuristic magic</p>

<p>Theft is not the problem, the problem is that paypal has its own credit reporting system that is buggy, unregulated, secretive, un-deletable and not subject to appeal. The more info you give them, the sorrier you’ll be in the long run.</p>

<p>What they do to validate cards like mine is charge $1.50 to it. When you check your statement, there is a code that they put on your statement. You enter it on PayPal so they know that the card isn’t a fake. Then they refund you $1.95. The only problem I have is that the one thing I bought the damn card for is the one thing I can’t buy with it, at least through PayPal.</p>

            <p>Whelp, You’ve already missed condition A, but at the moment, you may be hard pressed to buy it, Notch is 1. moving servers for the site and 2. the site is getting overloaded because of the update, you may have to wait a bit to purchase minecraft.</p>

            <p>Okay, I don’t have a credit card or access to one that I can borrow at the moment, so I bought a Vanilla Visa gift card. I have never had a problem with one before until I tried to buy Minecraft. I validated the card with PayPal, they took the $1.50 off my card, I entered the code that I got, and works. Problem is, it works for everything EXCEPT buying Minecraft, which is really making me want to scream. I’ve looked at Vanilla Visa’s FAQ’s and I’ve contacted them for help. I have looked at PayPal’s FAQ and contacted them for help. Both parties say they have no clue what’s wrong and that I’m basically S.O.L. So I come to you. CAN SOMEONE HERE PLEASE HELP ME? I really want to buy the game.</p>
