    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/admin-attention-required/15252</link>
    <description>I&#39;m posting this thread as there has been no official word on whether a responsible site admin has been notified of the current spam attack, which is quickly spiraling out of control. Right now, there are eight spam accounts at work, and the number of concurrent spam accounts appears to be steadily increasing. The only currently active mod ( [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/237-TheeGoatPig/&#39;]@TheeGoatPig[/url] ) is clearly getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of spam and he has reported that he is having trouble deleting the spam threads because of forum error messages.

I&#39;m having a lot of troubles deleting the threads. I keep getting forum error messages.
[/quote]
The following problems must be related to the error messages he&#39;s getting:
* Several threads in the Website Issues subforum have lost all their posts and show up as having -1 replies in the thread index.
* [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/12518-The-Unofficial-Official-Chat-Thread/&#39;]The Unofficial Official Chat Thread[/url] seems to have lost 87 pages&#39; worth of posts. EDIT: It appears that it&#39;s the first 87 pages that&#39;s been lost. When you open the thread, you see 702 pages, but in the thread index it&#39;s still listed as having 788 pages.
(As a side effect, my like count has dropped by one as I had a post with a like in one of the affected threads. I DEMAND COMPENSATION! /jk  [img]https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/tongue.png[/img] )[/size]

A site admin should address this issue ASAP, before too much damage is done to the forum.</description>

<p>I doubt the spammers are targeting the users of this forum. Instead, I think what they are trying to accomplish is to increase their search engine visibility.</p>
<p>Even though there’s little activity on the forums, the search engine bots are constantly crawling the site, as can be seen in the screenshot below. The “Baiduspider” bot, for example, is the crawler bot for the Chinese Baidu search engine.</p>

            <p>I agree.  On the old version of the forums, when there was a spammer I could click their name and then click “ban user, mark as spammer and delete all threads/posts by this user”.  Poof!</p>
<p>On the current forums I have to visit their profile, fill out a ban reason, only then can I ban the user.  Oh and then I have to find all their posts and threads, delete all those manually one-by-one and then via some work-around (I completely forgot how, it’s quite hidden) I can remove the “deleted thread” messages.  They can literally post it faster than I can delete them.</p>
<p>To be completely frank, it’s just not worth all the effort.  I’ll try and delete some though, now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span>  not to mention, moderator actions such as moving a thread to the trash take a loooooong time to finish and I get these every now and then:</p>

<p>You are right. What was I thinking.</p>
<p>I just felt that it was important to bring attention to the thread corruption that seemed to have occurred as a result of battling the spam, before we started losing threads like, for example, the ARG thread… So far, I haven’t spotted any other damaged threads other than the ones I mentioned, but I haven’t really checked all that much. As a regular user, there’s not much else I can do other than create a thread here. It’s not my job or place to start PM’ing admins, mods or devs about forum issues.</p>
<p>But Hubi came; he saw; he left. I don’t know if he saw this thread, or if anything was done, but the tsunami waves are still coming…</p>
<p>I think it’s sad and a shame that just about every time there’s a major spam attack, it’s hurting the forums in ways more than one. The deafening silence from the devs these days is also depressing. I know they are busy, but still…</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve changed the title of this thread to make it more visible. Let me know if it’s too obtrusive or inappropriate.</p>

<p>I thought this issue was fixed back in December, guess i was wrong.</p>
<p>EDIT: i made a dummy account under the username TestDummy a few days ago. You don’t need a steam account now.</p>
<p>For a while after Decembers spam attack i think some users, including myself, had to have a steam account to even log in.</p>
<p>This needs to be fixed, its getting ridiculous.</p>

            <p>I’m posting this thread as there has been no official word on whether a responsible site admin has been notified of the current spam attack, which is quickly spiraling out of control. Right now, there are eight spam accounts at work, and the number of concurrent spam accounts appears to be steadily increasing. The only currently active mod ( <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/237-TheeGoatPig/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@TheeGoatPig</a> ) is clearly getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of spam and he has reported that he is having trouble deleting the spam threads because of forum error messages.</p>

<p>I’m having a lot of troubles deleting the threads. I keep getting forum error messages.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The following problems must be related to the error messages he’s getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several threads in the Website Issues subforum have lost all their posts and show up as having -1 replies in the thread index.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/12518-The-Unofficial-Official-Chat-Thread/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Unofficial Official Chat Thread</a> seems to have lost 87 pages’ worth of posts. EDIT: It appears that it’s the first 87 pages that’s been lost. When you open the thread, you see 702 pages, but in the thread index it’s still listed as having 788 pages.<br>
(As a side effect, my like count has dropped by one as I had a post with a like in one of the affected threads. I DEMAND COMPENSATION! /jk  <img src="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/tongue.png" alt="" width="" height=""> )[/size]</li>
</ul>
<p>A site admin should address this issue ASAP, before too much damage is done to the forum.</p>
