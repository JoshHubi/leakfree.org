    <title>Metroid: Other M</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/metroid-other-m/5353</link>
    <description>So our old ecosystem-obliterating friend Samus has an all new adventure on the Wii, the lovechild between Nintendo and Team Ninja.  Basically, it&#39;s a window to Samus&#39; past and I guess bridges the silly gap between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion, so it&#39;s basically Metroid 3.5.

So what distinguishes Other M from its predecessors?
-3rd person 3D mix between isometric and sidescrolling movement
-Fast switching to first-person view
-Fast-paced movement and combat and takedown moves
-Laughable scripts in cinematic sequences
-Rechargeable health and missiles
-Lack of exploration until the very end
-OTHER STUFF

For the most part, it&#39;s a Metroid-themed average brawler, but it&#39;s still a lot of fun if you don&#39;t go in expecting to be the next Metroissiah.

I know most of you dopes are strictly PC gamers, or only have big macho-man consoles like Exboxes and Peyess threes, but I&#39;m sure one of you has a Wii and probably played this game.

Thoughts.  Discuss.  OR SUFFER.</description>

            <p>Super Metroid was very good, Fusion was good since it had better controls, more story and such, but it lacked some of the classic Metroid exploration that made Super Metroid so great.  Metroid: Other M went much further in that direction, to make speed and combat be some of the primary focus, along with story, but essentially no exploration.</p>
<p>However, if they made one more sequel, and kept MOST things from Other M, but put back the exploration, made a few areas have stronger and more memorable music, MADE CINEMATICS SKIPPABLE and hire competent writers, as well as take out the forced first-person pixel hunts and “dramatic” sequences, the resulting game would probably exceed all other Japan-made Metroid titles (the Prime trilogy is sort of its own class, comparing with them is apples to oranges).</p>
<p>Also, toning down the difficulty a bit would be nice.</p>

            <p>JeffMOD, if you have a 360, you should check out Shadow Complex.  The story is sorta lame, but it is pretty much what you’re asking for, minus more than one map.  If you don’t have a 360, then sadly you’re SOL.  IMO they should have put it on at least PC as well.</p>

<p>Nothing, but sprites generally aren’t high resolution. I just want a new metroid game that looks and feels like the next metroid game, and not an FPS or mixed gameplay.</p>
<p>Take everything that made the first three great, slap on better graphics for show (not that it needs it, SM still looks great, IMO) and make a huge game world to explore. And add just a pinch of backstory to the intro and storytelling ingame.</p>

            <p>I’ve actually started playing Metroid: Other M now. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable, with the exception of a few issues with the D-pad being main control. The real issue with the game definitely lies in everything else. Great, they want to have monologues. I’m cool with that… but does she really have NOTHING to monologue about except the obvious we’re currently watching? Also, the voice actor is so far out of character you can just picture her reading the script in front of a microphone. It sounds more like a book reading than actual lines someone would say.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just me, but level design is pretty poor too. I haven’t even played an hour and I’ve gotten myself lost about 3 times already. Also, sending us down a long, windy, and somewhat obscure hallway just to reach a room where a monologue plays HINTING at something cool only to have us turn around and go all the back but not telling us to go back… is not cool.</p>

            <p>I was sorta excited for this game, but at the same time sorta wary of it.  And that’s all because Team Ninja had a hand in it.  I didn’t like their work with Itagaki at the helm (he is seriously fucking overrated IMO) and from the one release we’ve seen from them since then, they seem perfectly content to milk the shit that Itagaki created.</p>
<p>I want to like this game, I really, really do, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over the fact that Team Ninja had a hand in it.  I’m sorta glad to hear that toe story is horrible, too.  Metroid games don’t need a super in-depth story.  Also, from playing Metroid Fusion, it seems like Adam would have been further in the past than however long it was between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.  I sorta figured that once she left the Chozo before the original Metroid, she signed up with the Federation (or whatever they’re called) and bummed around with them for a while, then broke off when Adam died.  Horrible idea to put him near the end of her story so far, IMO.</p>

            <p>It was just too much. The sudden adding of multiples planets, a new asthetic, new gameplay mechanics, Wii gimmicks, and characters with poor characterization just made the 3rd game feel so out of place next to Prime 1 and 2. It wasn’t a bad game, it just didn’t work as Prime 3 in the way I would have wanted it to.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who thought Metroid Prime 3 was excellent?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It was alright. The whole idea of phazon  corrupting your body was a bit B-movie-ish, fighting the boss of the first Leviathan was unnecessarily difficult, the environments were sparse with enemies (unlike the Phazon mines, where Elite Pirates decided to burst out of the stasis tanks as they were behind you and beam troopers came out of the fucking ceilings,), fighting some of the bosses required no strategy and were too repetitive (such as the Pirate Knight that rode whatever that jungle creature was called), and the difficulty modes always felt too easy, unlike Prime 2 where the first boss you encounter almost killed you. Also the voice acting sucked with the exception of pain noises and the Captain of the GF ship that serves as the first level looked like a macho douchebag.</p>
<p>With that said, everything else was perfect. Item placement was awesome, and I really didn’t give a shit about the graphics, since they were decent and looked like they belonged on another console, and navigating the environments was fun like with all metroid games</p>

<p>Prime 3 wasn’t as good as 2, 2 wasn’t as good as 1. While I didn’t care for <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, this one flat-out pisses me off.</p>

<p>This pretty much sums up my opinion of the Metroid games.</p>
<p>I haven’t actually gotten around to Playing Other M, been a bit busy and have a few things on the computer to play while brother plays Other M, but from what I’ve seen it appears like it won’t be as well done as previous titles. I’m sure most of the gameplay will be solid and fun, but decent atmosphere, environment, and story have been butchered… Basically it’s everything I thought they ruined in Corruption multiplied.</p>

<p>She spends 90% of her time bitching/swooning about Adam. She even disabled all of her power-ups to avoid ticking him off.</p>
<p>When they explained that you shouldn’t use power-bombs because of structural integrity blah blah blah, it seemed reasonable for her to not use them.</p>
<p>WHEN SHE DISABLES THE VARIA ARMOR (which stops her from slowly burning to death) AND ADAM SAYS “you should probably turn your varia armor function on” IT JUST MAKES HER LOOK LIKE A SPINELESS RETARD.</p>

            <p>Yup, your opinions are invalid. How can you possibly enjoy something that terrible. Honestly, its like English Majors wrote it.</p>
<p>Or Japs, who did write it. They really can’t make a good narrative to save their lives.</p>

            <p>Metaphorically speaking, in terms of character development it looks like they spent more time on giving Samus breast implants than actually explaining how she got them.</p>
<p>And I haven’t even played the game.</p>
