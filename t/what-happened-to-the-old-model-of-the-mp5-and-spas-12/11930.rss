    <title>what happened to the old model of the MP5 and SPAS 12?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/what-happened-to-the-old-model-of-the-mp5-and-spas-12/11930</link>
    <description>The first model of the MP5 with fixed stock and red dot sight we expected and we saw in the trailer did not appear in the game at launch like the old model of the SPAS 12 with folding stock did not appear in the release of game.
I wonder, will release an update in which placed these weapons?  :frowning:   :frowning:   :frowning:
