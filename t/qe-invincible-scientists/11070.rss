    <title>QE invincible scientists</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/qe-invincible-scientists/11070</link>
    <description>I did a search on the forums, but did not find a post about this yet. So here it is.

Typically I don&#39;t kill friendly NPCs, but I was messing around in QE after I had already beaten the game. In my devious endeavors to kill as many living organisms as possible, I noticed that the 3 scientists you meet in QE are impervious to a few weapons/weapon features, such as the secondary charge for the Tau Cannon and the crossbow.
They also appeared to have super human strength when It took more than a few headshots with the .357 to put them down.

<p>you can kill them with the crowbar, pistol, and shotgun just fine at any time in a matter of hits (sometimes just 1 hit).</p>

</aside>
<p>exactly haha. I can understand allowing them to take 2 hits max, just in case. Especially since 90% of the time my gun seems to involuntarily fire when a save is reloaded (another huge bug in my opinion, idk if its been brought up)<br>
But that is also why autosaves generally take place right before areas like that.</p>

<p>lol I didn’t notice that before… I think it’s just cause it lagged a tad at that moment.<br>
Either that, or the scientist realizes he’s gonna need to reload to take me down  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
