          <p>I played around half of half life in '99 but my computer died, took the HD install with it and  my physical disk was damaged after a move. I started playing HL2 in 2005 after a friend showed it to me. I was hooked. I found BMS in dec 2006  while trying to dig up info on EP2. I have followed the mod, played it and bought the game.</p>

          <p>FragUPlenty, kinda the same for me.</p>
<p>My uncle (who introduced me to building computers and gaming in general in ~1995 when I was 7) told me about this “cool new game where you start underground, fight a bunch of aliens and get to the surface”.  That was probably a year after HL came out, around 1999.  Then I found out about USS Darkstar from a friend, which lead me to hunting for HL mods (They Hunger, Poke646, Challenger Deep, etc).  Then, of course, came Opposing Force and Blue Shift, and Half Life 2 was pre-loaded before release.</p>
<p>I think I found out about Black Mesa when I still subscribed to PC Gamer, then MaximumPC did a quick blurb on it, and I’ve been following since.</p>
<p>I’m waiting until Xen to buy the retail version, personally.</p>

          <p>Purchased Half Life shortly after it came out and fell in love with it. I pursued anything and everything that had something to do with the Half Live universe. I became a beta tester for one of the mods where I heard about a new mod that was starting called Black Mesa so, I’ve been following the mod since its beginning.</p>

          <p>I had heard of Half Life before but never really looked it up or found interest in it.</p>
<p>Used to watch “Let’s Play”-ers on youtube. One in particular started playing the newly-released BM in 2012. Thought “hey thats cool” and downloaded it. She got to the first ichthyosaur encounter before I stopped watching incase of more spoilers. Decided to look up the ichthyosaur, which led to looking at all the aliens/enemies and weapons and just expanding into the half life universe. It all hooked me in.<br>
Stopped my BM playthrough (wasn’t even up to WGH yet), played through HL1, liked it. Well mostly anyway, cause I hadn’t ever played it before and it’s a fairly old game it didn’t really interest me as much as black mesa did just cause of it’s age. Finished my BM runthrough, absolutely loved it and then went back to play HL 2 and Eps 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Here I am nearly 3 years later and still loving it. So compared to most people who have posted I’m still quite “young” to the series.</p>

          <p>My uncle was the one who introduced me to gaming, ad the first FPS i played was actually HL2.<br>
So, since i was like 9 years old, for me it was like a brand new world.<br>
Also this sound got stuck in my head forever.<br>

          <p>^Funnily enough, I’m a similar case. My father introduced me to HL1 when I was around 8-9 yrs old. It was the first FPS I ever played (and the second game Diablo II was my first) ever. It still holds a special place in my life.</p>
<p>As for BM I stumbled across it when it was a CS:S Mod. But I wasn’t interested in it until around 2009/2010.</p>

<p>Like danielsangeo I’ve been playing FPS games since the grandfather of them all - Wolfenstein 3D. I was heavily into Doom and Duke Nuk’em 3D as a kid, was never a big fan of Quake or Quake 2 though.  I saw a friend playing Half-Life at the back end of 1998, and remember the intriguing magazine ads (a sepia toned picture of a vulnerable looking child with lambdas for pupils, nothing at all to do with the game but very eye-catching and original) and the rave reviews and buzz. Got it myself and played it through probably in early 1999, and was just blown away.  Even just the cinematic style opening credits were a revelation at the time, let alone the whole first section being without a gun, or enemies, but just setting the tone and introducing the world and story.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I was pretty much the same, but I found out about HL via PCPowerPlay and PC Gamer when it was previewed in 1997 or so.</p>
<p>I probably played way more CS than HL, but I did play an awful lot of SP mods for HL.</p>
<p>As for Black Mesa, I joined the Leak-Free forums back in the days of HL2’s release as I was fairly disappointed with HL Source and had heard about a Source remake on a few different forums.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few posts on the various BM forums over the years &gt;_&gt;</p>

          <p>(Warning, long post ahead)</p>
<p>I actually don’t really remember how I discovered the <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> series. I got into the series via <span class="bbcode-i">Portal</span>, and I don’t recall where I first heard of that.</p>
<p>I grew up with almost no exposure to video games (save for things like <span class="bbcode-i">Bugdom</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">Nanosaur</span>, and <span class="bbcode-i">Marble Blast Gold</span>), since my parents wouldn’t get me any and my early experiences with computer games at school convinced me that I just wasn’t meant for them (because I was terrible at them), so I didn’t play them with friends either. Then the trailer for <span class="bbcode-i">BioShock</span> aired and it filled me with awe; I decided right then and there that when I had my own money and a good enough computer, I was going to buy that and play it, and try out other games too. And then, I don’t remember how I found out about <span class="bbcode-i">Portal</span>, but that ended up being the first “real” video game I played. My computer at the time didn’t meet the system requirements for the licensed game, so I torrented it. It didn’t run incredibly well, but I didn’t know the difference and I really enjoyed it. From there I found out about <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 2</span> and the episodes, and played them as well.</p>
<p>(In case you’re wondering, I bought them on Steam, and I bought <span class="bbcode-i">Portal</span> on Steam too once I had a computer that could run it.)</p>
<p>By then I was roped in. I waited for <span class="bbcode-i">Portal 2</span> with bated breath, and played it for the first time at a party I threw to celebrate/mock the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_end_times_prediction" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Rapture</a> (lol). Then I found out about <span class="bbcode-i">Freeman’s Mind</span> (again, don’t remember how) and started watching that, and then reading the Combine OverWiki, and learning in a rather oblique way about the plot of <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span>.</p>
<p>To be honest, because of how old it is, my lack of exposure to games when I was young, and my lack of exposure to old games in general, <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> itself never seemed like a game I’d really have a great time with, and it still doesn’t. And I loved <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 2</span> and its story, but I couldn’t get myself to really care about <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span>’s story. It just wasn’t compelling for me. When I watched <span class="bbcode-i">Freeman’s Mind</span> and imagined what the game is like to actually play, the characters didn’t feel seem real, and because you don’t connect with anyone emotionally, the protagonist didn’t feel real, either.</p>
<p>But then I found out about <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span>, (oddly enough I don’t remember how that happened either), and that got me really excited. I tend to derive more enjoyment from games that have better or more realistic graphics, so I knew that, whether I cared about the story or not, I’d enjoy playing a <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> that looked and behaved more like <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 2</span>, than one that looked like <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> actually does. So I got stoked for <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span>, and waited.</p>
<p>And when I played that… Oh my God, that changed everything. I was shocked to find myself caring about Gordon’s journey on a level that rivalled <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life 2</span>. I found myself caring about everyone else in the facility. After I launched the rocket, as I gazed at the moon above the silo (holy shit that night sky is beautiful, good job guys), I imagined how I would be feeling right now, if I were Gordon. The guilt and fear and anger that would be rolling around in my head, now that I actually had a moment of peace to think. And I felt overwhelmed emotionally by this immersion into his situation, because I realized how how truly awful and incredibly <span class="bbcode-i">lonely</span> it was. That sense of “In The End You Are On Your Own” stayed with me through the rest of the game — and beyond, because it coloured my experience with <span class="bbcode-i">Blue Shift</span> and <span class="bbcode-i">Opposing Force</span> when I finally played them. (I still haven’t played <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span>; I’ve only gotten partway through “Unforeseen Consequences”.)</p>
<p>As I gazed at that moon, I also realized how <span class="bbcode-i">brave</span> Gordon was. Now that he’s had time to really think about how fucked up this situation is, surely his resolve might be wavering, just a little. And <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">he could just decide he’s had enough</a>, that he can’t do this anymore, and try to wait out the rest of the disaster out here. But he’s not going to. He’s going to keep moving forward, because there are lives at stake and he has to fix this. “Courage Is Not the Absence of Fear”.</p>
<p>To my amazement, as “End Credits 2” rolled, I thought of all Gordon had endured, all he had sacrificed, all he had witnessed, and how many people died…and I was <span class="bbcode-i">sad</span>. As Gordon, didn’t know what would happen to the people I had left behind; I didn’t know if I could fix all this; I didn’t know if what I was about to do would be worth everything I had already suffered. I didn’t know if I would even <span class="bbcode-i">survive</span>. And I was still, ultimately, totally alone. All I had as I prepared to face whatever horrors lay beyond, were memories of people getting killed and people suffering. My heart felt so heavy. And yet I was awestruck, too. Because I had connected on an emotional level with a story that I had thought held no emotional value. That’s what <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span> did for me.</p>
<p>So, even though this started as a post about how I discovered the <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> series and <span class="bbcode-i">Black Mesa</span>, it ends as a thank you to the Crowbar Collective, for taking the story of <span class="bbcode-i">Half-Life</span> and giving it the power to move me.</p>

          <p>This game was met by a youtube channel. Then directly by steam.<br>
I love half life 1,  I have the original cd of the game. My Father was playing a lot, and i saw him play.<br>
Personally I love the idea of escaping Black Mesa. Half Life 2 did not taste much like the first.<br>
It is for this reason that Black Mesa Source liked it so much</p>
