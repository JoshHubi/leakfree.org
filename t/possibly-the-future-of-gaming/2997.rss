<p>I am not sure what you mean, that you don’t believe that their games are becoming crappier and crappier, or that they are loosing ground in terms of players? Or are you being sarcastic? Sometimes I just cannot tell.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think we have too little information to sink this idea too quickly. We have a CEO “hinting” that CoD would go subscription based.</p>
<p>Now, subscription base makes sense for games like WoW or any other game where its playability would require constant monitoring/service from the developer. For wow, they need to maintain boat loads of servers and accounts, all of which cost money. You are spending your 15 bucks a month to get something.</p>
<p>If COD goes MMO, then this model is logical.</p>
<p>But an FPS? Unless this next CoD comes with massive amounts of updates, add-ons, new maps, new campaigns, and basically gives you something to pay for every month, it simply is not worth it. Simply getting the ability to play the game for the month is not worth 15 dollars, unless you only intend on playing for 4 months.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Valve has released FPS games that have come with constant updates and additional free content. This content is worth money, yet they give it away for free to the PC owners.</p>
<p>Not that I WANT to pay for Valve’s extra goodies, but lets face it: If Valve asked for a small fee for the TF2 updates (I know, they do on XBox… not their choice) it would actually be quite fair.</p>
<p>Oh, and Activision throwing some stupid idea around hardly comes anywhere near even possibly being the “future of gaming.” Over react much?</p>

            <p>Well, they did remake Half-Life in the Source Engine. They just didn’t update the textures or graphics :retard: .</p>
<p>And I couldn’t really care less about CoD online. I don’t really think it’s all that fun and I don’t feel like throwing money at Microsoft to be able to get online…</p>

<p>Especially with the HD pack.</p>

            <p>Well, Valve negotiated with Microsoft to keep the updates to TF2 on the 360 free, but Microsoft refused. That’s why (apparently) updates are farther between, so that they release several at once to make up for the cost.</p>
<p>And I don’t see why people bash so HL:S so much. It’s not like Valve said that they were going to completely redo the game in the Source engine. Like someone else here said, it was just Valve proving that it would be extremely easy to import HL’s resources onto the engine.</p>

<p>I highly doubt that, Valve is the ONLY industry I know that does updates for there games ALOT, for FREE (Team Fortress 2 (PC only), Left 4 Dead Survival mode) Had the Orange Box which contains 5 different games, 3 of them new for the price of one. And does their own funny little videos (Team Fortress 2’s Meet The videos). The only bad thing that Valve has done so far in their career was Half-Life Source.</p>
<p>PLUS! They are the only ones to CARE about their customers. Gabe Newell went to a college class full of deaf students, and took some tips on what they can improve to make the game more enjoyable for them.</p>

<p>Half the CoD fans I know would be pissed about it, but they would still fork out the cash for it. Thats what scares me.</p>

<p>Its a good thing i dont play their shit, its not the future of gaming. Valve would never go that low. As sad as it may seem though, there WILL be people who will buy a subscription to play COD, them damn fanboys. Its sad that people already do it for WoW.</p>

<p>Valve will follow the same path over time, just wait for the original employees to leave or retire. Same thing happend to Infinity Ward.</p>
