            <p>I’ve been using steam on a large HD in my bedroom for a while now, and for some reason when I saw the video about Big Picture, I assumed they were working on some sort of Valve-console to play PC games in your living room.</p>
<p>Now that I understand what this is, it’s really no change for me, but it might make me start using my gamepad more…</p>

            <p>I just hope this encourages split screen play, a feature that I feel most modern pc games are missing. Hell even console games are starting to abandon it with the developers citing hard where limitations.</p>

            <p>Another obvious plus for playing PC games on your TV rather than console games is the post-processing available to high-end PC users, like AA and whatnot. Space Marine runs at a buttery smooth high framerate and looks much better than it’s 360 counterpart, but you also get the added comfort of lounging on the couch rather than hunched in a chair.</p>
<p>Big Picture mode definitely has its uses.</p>
<p>My only problem now is that I have to choose between playing on the big screen, or playing in SLI Surround  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>Ironic, that Valve would make a really good controller interface that seems to be better then existing console designs, for a PC.</p>
<p>Somebody in the youtube comments asked if plugging it into the TV would make steam run his games better then his mac does :lol:</p>

            <p>So, I love Big Picture mode. I just went out and bought a wired 360 controller to plug into my PC and loaded up steam on the 40 inch to play some Space Marine. It’s really cool. Obviously I will only be using it to play ‘controller friendly’ games such as Space Marine, Just Cause 2, etc. So far, I really like the wheel keyboard thing and the internet browser. I think I actually like the whole thing better than the Xbox dashboard…</p>

            <p>Does the browser inside of it seem really fast to anyone else, or is it just me?<br>
If this had a more user friendly tab system I’d leave the Steam client a lot less.</p>

            <p>You can get decent typing speeds on that type of keyboard. My psp had something called the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xVt6Z.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">danzeff keyboard</a> in several homebrew programs. It made the IM’ing application usable. Once you become proficient in it I equate its speed to about that of writing. Not super fast but never feels frustratingly slow like the normal onscreen keyboard.</p>

<p>That daisywheel thing is pretty damn clever. With some practice you can type stuff with the controller pretty quickly. Much better than the virtual keyboard thing that consoles use right now.</p>
