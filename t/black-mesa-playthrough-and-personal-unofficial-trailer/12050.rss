    <title>Black Mesa Playthrough and Personal Unofficial Trailer</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-playthrough-and-personal-unofficial-trailer/12050</link>
    <description>I am a video editor and Youtuber, and I spend a lot of my time creating content for people. Lately I&#39;ve been pretty slow on channel growth, and I never thought once to share it with the community that actually made the game. Whether or not it&#39;s the right thing to do, I guess I&#39;ll show you guys the Unofficial Trailer I made along with the first part of my let&#39;s play of Black Mesa.

Trailer I made:

Tell me what you think either on the video comments or on the forum.  :smiley: . Honest critique please, but don&#39;t just say &quot;I hate it&quot;. Tell me why, like for example that you think my general approach on editing was bad, my choice of scenes, or maybe even my commentary. Anything helps me approve.</description>

<p>Thanks for watching my videos guys, it really got me some views on my channel, and I’d appreciate that you check out my Half Life 2 Playthrough I started a few days ago. You can see it here.</p>
<p>Half Life 2 Part 1: Point Insertion<br>

<p>If you’d like to see more, it’s always helpful to subscribe and show your friends, I work hard to make these videos.</p>
<p>Part 2 will be up with Part 3 tonight as I had to take part 2 down because it had some “editing problems”. I had left a small clip at the end 8 minutes after the end of the video, and it black screened to that section.</p>

            <p>Well, let’s say everyone has to start somehow… personally, I can’t do a shit, so wouldn’t be fair to criticize. It’s not bad, but it’s neither good.</p>
