    <title>black mesa saved chapter games are gone after steam release</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-saved-chapter-games-are-gone-after-steam-release/14281</link>
    <description>Hi All. Got a quick question about saved games. Initially, I had black mesa mod installed using provided setup download from black mesa website. It was installed, and black mesa appeared under steam library. The way I understand it, the game was installed in my steam directory, and saved games were also in steam directory path.

After a steam release, I purchased black mesa on steam, and game was downloaded again. Was it installed under the same path as the original mod location? i noticed that my saved games are gone, and I am playing black mesa from chapter one now. Is this normal?

With other future releases, on steam, will the saved chapter games remain or will they be gone?</description>

<p>Consider the paid Steam version to be a completely new game on a completely new engine. It is so different from the original free Black Mesa mod under the hood, that it’s probably a good idea to think of the two as entirely separate, completely incompatible games. The new version is NOT considered a mod (it’s considered a full retail game), which means it was not installed in the original <span class="bbcode-i">sourcemods/BMS</span> location. It is now located in <span class="bbcode-i">common/Black Mesa</span>.</p>

<p>Future releases will be patches to the new game. Sometimes the saves will still be compatible, sometimes they will be broken. There are no guarantees, unfortunately. The saves may still be there, but they might have awful game-breaking glitches. At the very least, you won’t have to start at chapter 1.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, you can’t use old save files with the new release.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“We are not physically able to support old save games. When the game binaries change in a certain way, save games break because they rely on old binaries. This is impossible to work around.”</span></p>
