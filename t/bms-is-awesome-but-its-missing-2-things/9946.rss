    <title>BMS is awesome, but its missing 2 things.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bms-is-awesome-but-its-missing-2-things/9946</link>
    <description>So, I really love the mod, but found two things missing: 
1. There is no Barney saying: &quot;Catch Me Later, I&#39;ll Buy You a Beer!&quot; Because in Half Life 2 Barney says: &quot;About that beer I owed you!&quot; And: 
2. When you ruin that microwave casserole, there is no Dr. Magnusson in that room, but in Half Life 2: Episode 2, Dr. Magnusson says: &quot;Oh, and Freeman! If you pull this off, I might just forgive you for that debacle at Black Mesa. You know the one I mean... involving a certain microwave casserole.&quot; So I hoped that I could see these in game.  :smiley:  This is nothing serious but it would be nice too see these ingame.  :stuck_out_tongue:  Thank you!</description>

<p>So were Eli and Kleiner. Scientist models used to swap around back when I first played, so I’ve had completely different people take the roles of the two. So was “Barney,” for that matter. Half-Life 2 gave us named characters with unique personalities. Half-Life just had “scientists,” “guards” and “marines.” If anything, Black Mesa giving so many their own identity is actually quite inspired. Especially the grumpy guard right before the Xen jump  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, thank you for letting guards use shotguns and magnums. They’re more accurate with those things than I am.</p>

<p>Is it me the only one who noticed the -no alcoholic beverages in the BMRF- sign?</p>
<p>What I miss from the game, I hope later patches will fix: the lack of balance.<br>
- Hecu marines are too tough, and accurate (as well as the Apache helicopters), Xen aliens don’t stand a chance against them —  that’s no reason for a pull out.<br>
- Also, the Itchnysaur… um… the big ugly fish from Xen, is too weak. A clip from our beloved pistol is enough to kill him.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree, these balance issues are probably my only real complaint so far. The Ichthyosaurs is too easy to kill, and the difficulty spikes dramatically every time there is a marine encounter.</p>
<p>Edit: ALSO, I just got to the first Assassin encounter and they are insanely difficult (but very fun to fight against). Nothing wrong with some difficulty spikes to keep things interesting, but I imagine a couple things will be scaled back at some point.</p>

<p>Those things you mention are sort of easter eggs in HL2, there is no need to ‘fix’ HL1 to keep the continuity.</p>

            <p>Barney is the Calhoun, is he?</p>
<p>Well, then there IS an explanation.<br>
I talked to the officer of the security that stands right before the chamber where you can see the reactor (or whatever it is) for the first time. With Dr. Kleiner in it.</p>
<p>So, that officer of security says something like that if you click on him:</p>
<p>“After the shift, you, me and Calhoun will go get a beer he owes you.”</p>
<p>I don’t remember the exact phrase though, but I do remember that he mentioned this.</p>

            <p>Well they already explained stuff, but forget about that for a second. Magnusson in Episode 2 had mentioned the casserole in a tone that seemed to be letting Freeman know that he knows he blew up his casserole, which would suggest he wasn’t in the same room at the time.</p>

<p>Yea I remeber guard mentioning that but still, and there is Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance so why not Magnusson?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  And as I said this is nothing serious but would be fun and nice to see.</p>

</aside>
<p>Those 2 issues have been debated to death before the mod was even released, and the consensus was that Barney is the first guard seen banging on the door during chapter Inbound, and the other Barneys don’t really owe you a beer.</p>
<p>And the microwave thing was solved too. Magnusson was never in the room with you but he found out right before the resonance cascade.</p>

            <p>I would say the only two things that this is missing is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Xen</li>
<li>Black Mesa: Deathmatch</li>
</ol>
<p>But other than that, this was near perfection.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  Teehee.</p>

            <p>So, I really love the mod, but found two things missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no Barney saying: “Catch Me Later, I’ll Buy You a Beer!” Because in Half Life 2 Barney says: “About that beer I owed you!” And:</li>
<li>When you ruin that microwave casserole, there is no Dr. Magnusson in that room, but in Half Life 2: Episode 2, Dr. Magnusson says: “Oh, and Freeman! If you pull this off, I might just forgive you for that debacle at Black Mesa. You know the one I mean… involving a certain microwave casserole.” So I hoped that I could see these in game.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  This is nothing serious but it would be nice too see these ingame.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Thank you!</li>
