    <description>So I RMA&#39;d my HD4850 1Gb

It&#39;s been a while...they offered me a XFX HD 5750 as an alternative.

Seems pretty similar in benchmarks, what does everyone else think? Is it comparable? I was hoping for a 5770 myself.</description>

            <p>5750 isn’t bad at all, I’d say go for it since they won’t give up the 5770.</p>
<p>I myself use a 5770 and am looking into purchasing a second to xfire. Still not sure if it is justifiable or not, but the 57xx series is pretty solid in my experience.</p>

            <p>Both the 5750 and the 5770 run for about $100.</p>
<p>The 4850 is running around ten dollars less, but its getting less easy to find… it’s 2 generations behind, at this point.</p>
<p>imo the performance difference between any of those gpu’s would be pretty low, but of course the 5770 would come out on top. I think the 5770 is maybe 10-15% faster than the 4850, and the 5750 would be right in the middle.</p>

            <p>I believe 5770 is more in the price range of the 4850 than 5750 is.</p>

            <p>inb4 :3 I did ask for a 5770. The 5750 is better than the 4850 for sure…but only by 2-3 frames in most cases.</p>

            <p>ask them for a 5770 then, say you looked at benchmarks that indicate the 5750 is slower than your old card</p>
