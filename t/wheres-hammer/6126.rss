    <title>Where&#39;s Hammer?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/wheres-hammer/6126</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been a few months since I&#39;ve been able to log in to Steam, and so when I started it up I had a few updates installed. After everything was updated I went to the &quot;Tools&quot; section of my Library to look for Hammer so I could work on the map I&#39;ve been making and it wasn&#39;t there. I have looked for about 15 minutes, and I cannot find that stupid program. Am I just blind? I would appreciate any help.

            <p>Thanks Cameron: D<br>
:facepalm: Wow, it’s been so long since I used it, I completely forgot that. I feel like a complete idiot now. I’m just going to go back to lurking.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
