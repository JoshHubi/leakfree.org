    <title>G Man Sightings</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/g-man-sightings/11028</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always been interested in G man in the half life series; as im sure most of you are as well. I always try to spot him as many times as i can through the game but i never manage to find him that often.

So far i&#39;ve only seen him twice in Black Mesa..

Once in the beginning where he is talking to that scientist and when you stare for long enough they see you and draw the blinds.

Another time pretty early in the game after the resonance cascade where he can be seen on a catwalk when you enter the room below him and he exits through a doorway to his left. 

Has anyone else spotted him in other spots? If so please tell me where because i   know i saw him more often in the original half life and i doubt these are the only 2 spots he can be seen

I apologize if there&#39;s already a thread on this. I couldn&#39;t find one</description>

            <p>On my first playthrough, I more or less lived into Gordon and when I saw him, I was like “Hey, there’s that weird suit guy again. So what, gonna play a staring contest with me? <em>G-Man leaves</em> Hmmm. Guess not. Anyway, on with killing the aliens <em>presses button</em> Hell yeah!”</p>
<p>BM is just awesome.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, he bleeds this time. In Half-Life, if you decide to shoot the G-Man, your rounds spark off him like he’s armoured, kind of like what you’d get by shooting the Grunts in their armoured bits. In Black Mesa, if you shoot him, he bleeds big red sprites and leaves blood marks on the wall. The man doesn’t flinch, of course, and he can’t die, but the difference is there.</p>
<p><em>edit</em><br>
He bleeds from crossbow shots, at least. Not too sure about regular bullets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Considering how the source engine handles these things, he probably bleeds from anything.<br>
Hopefully they’ll patch it so just sparks fly off like it should be.</p>

            <p>My favorite was the one in the window of the door as seen in the screenshot above. I’ve been watching a bunch of playthroughs on youtube and so far everytime the person playing always walks straight by it and it’s painful to me, I just want to scream LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT!!</p>

            <p>Mother of god, part 2</p>
<p>By the way, the first image from Mother of god part 1 depicted a moment that really scared the hell out of me. You are in the level where you can gather up a bunch of guards and scientists, and in one hall way just before you meet some HECU you turn right to see a Gman staring right at you through the door. He then walks away quietly.</p>
<p>In Half-Life 2, I remember one sighting where Gman could be seen far away out in the open on a platform on the left (this was outside). It was really cool because I NEVER noticed him in HL1 besides the ending when he talks to you, and that was my first sighting of Gman in HL2. I didn’t get why he was there, but I was flipping out.</p>
<p>He reminds us all that all of this is just apart of his scheme. With every single thing we do, he is watching. I cannot wait to find out more about him in Half-Life 3.<br>

            <p>I’ve seen him on the tram ride just before pulling into Sector C, talking to a scientist in a closed room, after the RC on a catwalk, through the door window as seen above, on the catwalk in WGH!, looking at the Garg in PU, in QE just before the headcrab room, and walking through the portal in LC. I’m pretty sure all the locations are the same as in HL.</p>

            <p>I saw him twice pre-cascade. Once on the tram and another talking with the scientist. The only other time I saw him was in that area you get grenades… I think.</p>
<p>I have yet to see a thread just about this, incase you were wondering.</p>

            <p>I’ve always been interested in G man in the half life series; as im sure most of you are as well. I always try to spot him as many times as i can through the game but i never manage to find him that often.</p>
<p>So far i’ve only seen him twice in Black Mesa…</p>
<p>Once in the beginning where he is talking to that scientist and when you stare for long enough they see you and draw the blinds.</p>
<p>Another time pretty early in the game after the resonance cascade where he can be seen on a catwalk when you enter the room below him and he exits through a doorway to his left.</p>
<p>Has anyone else spotted him in other spots? If so please tell me where because i   know i saw him more often in the original half life and i doubt these are the only 2 spots he can be seen</p>
<p>I apologize if there’s already a thread on this. I couldn’t find one</p>
