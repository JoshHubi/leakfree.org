    <title>Looking for a couple of Apex Legends players</title>

    <description>Titanfall 2 being one of the all time great fps games that was sadly set up for failure is still alive somewhat, I still play it. But now.... Respawn has given us Apex Legends.  It&#39;s free and if you havent checked it out, you NEED TO. Right so I&#39;m on frequently but I&#39;m getting a little tired of the hit and miss teammates. I dont care if we all suck,but trying to get on the same page as a team would be most welcomed. If there is anyone wanting to team up, (its 3 man squads) I&#39;m available 24/7.  I have comms as well, but using the ping system is great too. So if anyone is wanting to play as a team, hit me up. nothing serious like tournaments, just having a good time playing with a small group that will work together. Hit me up on here or on origin or on steam under drgibbles</description>
