    <title>The magical game genie. (Which game do you want more)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-magical-game-genie-which-game-do-you-want-more/7247</link>
    <description>Game time. Two unreleased games are presented to you. You have to choose one or the other. You get the game of you choice right now, but can never play the other, ever. I&#39;ll start.

MW3 or BF3?

BF3 because, frankly the two games look the same to me, except BF3 is prettier. and I know that MW4 will come out eventually and it&#39;ll probably be basically the same thing. 

If you have an idea for another comparison, post it. Someone do something with Skyrim. And feel free to answer multiple choices.</description>

            <p>If I’m going to do this properly…<br>
BF3 over MW3 - I love destructible environments, and the graphics look amazing.<br>
HL3 over Ep3 or BM - I really want to see what new gameplay features Valve put in.<br>
ME3 over DA3 - if it’s done properly, DA3 could be brilliant, but that can’t compare to the epic storyline (in the traditional, Tolkien/Wheel of Time meaning of epic) that ME3 has when combined with ME1 and ME2.</p>

            <p>BF3 without a doubt… If I REAAAALLLY wanted to play MW3… I could just go play MW1… Pretty much the same game… except not with all the lame killstreaks. But, why would I do that when I could be playing BF3?</p>
<p>Anywho… BF’s main focus has always been the MP… since the beginning. Theyare doing a sp because they can. On the other hand.</p>
<p>CoD’s focus has always been on the SP… but seems to be turning around… and failing…</p>
<p>Still manages to sell due to little kids and their retarded parents.</p>

<p>MW3 or BF3?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’d rather have BF3 and never play any CoD game than have the entire CoD series and never play BF3. They do not look the same in any way shape or form. Of course all BF3 has really showed us is some campaign, which really isn’t BF’s strong point, wait until you see both games’ mp and then you will see the difference.</p>

<p>HL3 vs BM</p>

</aside>
<p>HL3. As badass as BM is HL3 is probably going to be a bigger game and made by the best professionals in the business. Also, a new spectacular game will always beat a spectacular remake.</p>
<p>My turn. Star Wars Battlefront III (if it weren’t canceled and what you’d hope for) vs. HL3. Personally, I’d go with SWBFIII, as badass as Half-Life is, SWBF is just so amazing and offers so much more when it comes to multiplayer. But who knows, maybe with HL3 they’ll really get multiplayer right.</p>

            <p>Game time. Two unreleased games are presented to you. You have to choose one or the other. You get the game of you choice right now, but can never play the other, ever. I’ll start.</p>
<p>MW3 or BF3?</p>
<p>BF3 because, frankly the two games look the same to me, except BF3 is prettier. and I know that MW4 will come out eventually and it’ll probably be basically the same thing.</p>
<p>If you have an idea for another comparison, post it. Someone do something with Skyrim. And feel free to answer multiple choices.</p>
