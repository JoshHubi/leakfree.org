    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/this-is-really-off-please-a-fix/10293</link>
    <description>Any explanation why do the enemies have [b]Aim Bot?[/b] Once they see JUST Gordon&#39;s finger, they start shooting and almost never do miss.... I&#39;m playing on Hard, so no idea how it is on other difficulty settings. I can&#39;t enjoy the game as much due to this reason... instead of tactical shooting, it&#39;s tactical pressing of save/load buttons.
By selecting the &quot;auto aim&quot; in BMS options, I had no idea it affects enemies instead of the player  :smiley: 

Another thing is the Apache is a matter of luck or fail on Hard, no kidding now... it&#39;s a matter of NERVES.
It&#39;s almost IMPOSSIBLE to hit with the Tau Cannon, had to use cheats to get a Rocket Launcher :fffuuu: and still it wasn&#39;t a fair fight.

I know it&#39;s supposed to be challenging, but didn&#39;t have these kinds of problems with the original HL1 as the AI was kinda different.

Also please, reduce the &quot;drowning shader&quot; because the visibility underwater sucks, and when it&#39;s all blue, Gordon is basically blind so it doesn&#39;t help any, thanks.</description>

<p>Erm.  Tau Cannon ammo is rather plentiful in that side warehoue.  It can take out the Heli in half an ammo reserve.  And I fail to see how it’s hard to hit.  The Cannon is hitscan from what I can tell.</p>

            <p>I agree. I was just at the part of surface tension where soldiers are dropped from an osprey, and they could hit me even when I couldn’t see them at all. I think maybe an inch of my head was sticking out.</p>
<p>At first I didn’t know what was going on and thought maybe there was a soldier on a roof somewhere that I didn’t see, but it was just the soldiers on the ground with auto aim.</p>

            <p>Well, because you don’t get the rocket launcher until the cliffs sequence, for one, but yeah, the tau cannon works as well.</p>

            <p>You guys, that part is easy once you know what to do.</p>
<p>Once you get to the dam, there’s a large warehouse/generator housing thing on your right next to the dam. Take cover in there with the Tau cannon, wait for the helicopter to stop firing, then step out and fire with the Tau cannon. I usually aim for center mass, but most of the hits seem to be indicated by the rotor, so that’s probably where I hit as my aim drifts up with the recoil. There’s also some Tau ammo in the crates in this room, so make sure most of your bursts hit and the Helo will set on fire and retreat.</p>

            <p>I tau’d the copter on the dam, the only difference it makes is it retreats sooner. Also, had to use non-charged shot spam to be able to do it, on normal. Went from 100 health and 75 suit to just 35 health.</p>

            <p>You’re not actually supposed to engage the helicopter when you first see it, rush past it will sod off for a while. only returning when you find the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>And yes, the soldiers are ridiculously quick to react and aim, turning battles into wars of attrition rather than tactics most of the time. I made a thread prior that there should be a longer reaction and aiming time on them, also a proper vision cone rather than how they can see you even if you are behind them.</p>
<p>Edit: Another potential part of the solution would be to have soldiers ‘flinch’ when hit.  This would allow the player to effectively ‘lock down’ a single target. Thus allowing tactical use of the environment and cover to engage and defeat enemies one at a time.</p>
