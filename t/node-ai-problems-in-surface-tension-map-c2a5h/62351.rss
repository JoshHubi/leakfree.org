    <title>Node/AI problems in Surface tension map c2a5h</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/node-ai-problems-in-surface-tension-map-c2a5h/62351</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve encountered a problem in map c2a5h where it states that the node graph is out of dater and of course rebuilds it. But after it rebuilds the node any time I die or load a save after the fact it disables the AI and doesn&#39;t even show the full text on screen. I have no workshop addons active at the moment or even installed. I have reentered the map multiple times but the problem persists. No other maps in the chapter share this problem though

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Adding <code>game bms</code> at the top of the searchpaths section in gameinfo.txt seems to fix the problem with A.I. Disabled in bm_c2a5h.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		...
		SearchPaths
		{
			game bms
			 // Black Mesa VPK files.
			game+mod bms/bms_textures.vpk
			...
</code></pre>
<p>This will make it so that loose files are read before packaged ones, and any loose nodegraph file, which is written when you get the nodegraph out of date, will be read instead of the stale one in the VPK files.</p>
<p>I just played through the entire map with no issues, even though I saved/reloaded several times.</p>
<p>This is just a temp fix until the devs update the stale nodegraph file(s) in the VPKs.</p>
<p>EDIT: Note, this issue is specific to the Xen Technical Beta (in the current public-beta branch).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think you can possibly work around the “A.I. Disabled” issue in bm_c2a5h by adding <code>ai_norebuildgraph 1</code> to autoexec.cfg. Alternatively, type it in the console and restart the map or load a save.</p>

            <p>I did post in Discord, and someone suggested a workaround which I thought I tried but I did it and it worked.</p>
<p>You have to load a save right before the load zone that rebuilds the nodegraph, and then get through the entire level up to “forget about freeman” (where the security guard gets left behind and the door closes on him. Then the ai_disabled goes away. The security guard can not die either. I put it on easy and just speedran the level, the bit where he runs to the security shed you have to be careful he doesnt die.</p>
