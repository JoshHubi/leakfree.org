    <description>[url=&#39;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html&#39;]Eight years ago, struggling to remove deadly E. coli from hamburgers, an entrepreneurial company from South Dakota came up with a novel idea: [u]injecting beef with ammonia[/u].

The company, Beef Products Inc., had been looking to expand into the hamburger business with a product made from beef that included fatty trimmings the industry [u]once relegated to pet food and cooking oil. The trimmings were particularly susceptible to contamination.[/u]

With the U.S.D.A.’s stamp of approval, the company’s processed beef has become a mainstay in America’s hamburgers. [u]McDonald’s, Burger King and other fast-food giants[/u] use it as a component in ground beef, as do grocery chains.[/url]

MMM, pathogen-contaminated Ammonia-flavored pet food burgers... boy am I glad I stopped eating processed meat. Anyway, this thread is to discuss the pros/cons of a vegetarian lifestyle. I&#39;m not totally vegetarian but I think we can learn alot from their healthy habits.</description>

            <p>I think we can vie to stop factory farming which is harmful to the welfare of the animals (and the quality of the food once the animal is slaughtered) without striving for vegetarianism or veganism.  If you want to be a vegetarian or vegan, fine by me.  I’ll still have the bacon cheeseburger or chicken salad, please.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It annoys me when vegetarians or vegans claim it is unnatural for us to eat meat.  That we are, indeed, supposed to be herbivores.</p>
<p>If this were true, I eating meat would be taboo in our society, but it isn’t, it’s almost ASSUMED you eat meat.  Not to mention there is not one culture – NOT ONE – that forgoes eating meat.  .</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not so. Buddhist communities tend to encourage vegetarianism, and buddhism itself kind of requires it as well for strict practitioners, as far as I can remember.</p>
<p>I too dislike the ‘unnatural’ arguement because it doesn’t quite fit reality; humans evolved as omnivores, hence the incisory and canine teeth, primarily for meats, and molars which are often found in herbivores.</p>
<p>I would say however there is some weight to the arguement that just because it’s natural to be omnivores doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive to become vegetarians to reduce the amount of animals being bred in captivity to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can’t stand preachy vegetarians; I don’t intend to change other peoples habits.</p>

            <p>We are omnivores, if we were herbivores then our stomachs wouldn’t digest meat. I don’t think that is an argument the give often, maybe stupid ones. The argument I hear most is it is funding the mass slaughter and torture of animals. E.g. chickens kept in large containers which never see daylight and shit on each-other.</p>

<p>icwatudidthar :awesome:</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve been a vegetarian for a while for a few reasons. Firstly becasue my parents are, and I grew up with it, but its mostly the health benefits, low fat diet etc etc.</p>
<p>And it’s fucking <span class="bbcode-i">cheap</span> man. Vegetarian meat subsitute fillets are like three times cheaper than a pack of chicken filllets at my supermarket.</p>
