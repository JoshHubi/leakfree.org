    <description>I can&#39;t believe they actually made and finished it. It had been reduced to rumor for so many years, and I could have sworn Troy Duffy (writer/director) had been reduced to, &quot;You&#39;ll never work in this town again!&quot; syndrome. And yet, here is the trailer:

            <p>My important thoughts on the matter: the first one was a dumb Tarantino ripoff, but it had a funky vibe permeate throughout the whole thing that made it seem like less of a cheapy-action-flick and more of a stylized kinda-cool flick. This second one seems to have lost that magic vibe.</p>

            <p>I fucking loved the first movie and was disappointed when the 2nd one was delayed(I don’t know the details) to the point where it seemed unlikely to ever be made…but if/when it comes out…I WILL see it.  I have like 15 damn posters of the first one &gt;=D  I think im just short of getting the tattoos.</p>

            <p>It’s not that I think it will suck. I just don’t think it will be as good as it could have been.</p>
<p>The Schmecker replacement irks me. The stylization of the trailer is off-putting. The first one pointed out that “shit like this only happens on TV.” And here they are using bad TV gimmicks. The replacement of Rocco with this new mohawk guy. It looks like they are trying too hard.</p>
<p>It’s just a feeling I am getting. I hope it is good, but I am unsure if it will be.</p>
<p>And I removed my opinion from the first post to encourage people to come to their own conclusions about it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>The only thing that seemed to indicate enough information to make me worry is the female replacement for Willem Defoes character. It mentions she is his prodigy, but it looks like she is trying to impersonate his actions too much, and could become a crappy parody of the original character. Other than that I found the trailer too stylized and cut up to tell too much from it. Is there something specific that puts you off? I hate seeing bad movies, so I want to know what I may have missed.</p>

            <p>It is a good start, and I will definitely watch it. But the first one just had an edge that I don’t think the second one lives up to. It looks more derivative than evolutionary to me. It could be just me, and I will gladly be proven wrong if it turns out to be a good movie. But my expectations aren’t very high.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what makes you think that. There is almost no information to go on from the trailer, and the IMDB read doesn’t rally indicate too much to me. At least a good number of the original cast, and the original director are back. That is a good start in my book. Imma watchin’</p>
