    <title>From Console Gaming to PC Gaming.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/from-console-gaming-to-pc-gaming/4882</link>
    <description>Since most users of this forums are PC gamers I figure this would be a good place to ask this.

How many of us actually started gaming on the PC.  No I am not talking about if you mostly played NES but played a little Doom on your computer or something. The majority of you gaming was done on PC.

I know I started on consoles.  I played some games on my computer Diablo, Half-Life, Doom and Command &amp; Conquer games but mostly it was Nintendo consoles from the NES to Gamecube and then 360.  Until the begging of last year.

I&#39;m simply curius because PC seem like a weird place to start gaming.  Most parents don&#39;t think of a PC the same way the think of a PlayStation or Atari.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I only started PC gaming last year due to Lamsey constantly demanding I purchase TF2. I did and it ran like shit. But it was <span class="bbcode-i">ace</span>.<br>
So now one year on I’m beginning to look at expanding my options a little. The idea of modding the games I adore - like Oblivion, Mass Effect and Dragon Age have so much room for tweaking so I can essentially tailor it specifically to me.</p>
<p>But I still absolutely adore my Xbox. I love coming back from work and being able to sprawl across my bed and just veg out to Viva Pinata or whatever. Yeah I’m going to be that person that buys Kinectimals. I think I will always have a console, but now I’ll be looking to have a PC alongside it.</p>

<p>I have a projector set up next to my computer and a white sheet between the projector and my couch. I have my keyboard connected to a long usb extension and my mouse plugged into my keyboard. The keyboard goes in my lap and the mouse on top of a plastic bin set next to me on the couch. It’s actually very comfortable.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s the problem, though. Consoles are designed to work on TVs, so you can play while you relax on the couch. No one’s gonna plunk a desk down in front of the TV just so they can play, especially not when they want to lounge and play with friends. And while FPSs really don’t work as well on consoles,  they work well enough. Plus, no game developer in their right mind would leave a market that profitable untapped just because it wasn’t fully optimized for the hardware. So…we’re kind of stuck lol.</p>
<p>These motion controls are kind of getting out of hand though IMO. They seem to be moving in the opposite direction of relaxing, making you be on your feet flailing around. Soon you won’t be able to play a game without standing up and exercising. Are you perhaps missing a leg? Well screw you. Tired from a hard day’s work, want to sit down and chill? Screw you too. Want to play games with your friends and <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> hit each other in the face, throw controllers into TVs and knock people over? Screw you a thousand times! Although it might not be such a bad thing if it gets some of us lardasses to lose some weight  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My dad was always a computer buff so that’s all we had in the beginning. Our first computer was a Tandy 1000. Good old DOS days. I have fond (and not so fond) memories of those old boot disks to get various games running properly. We also had a Tandy Color Computer 3 (TRS-80 equivalent) which was kind of blurred the lines as both a computer and a game console. While my friends were playing their Super Mario Bros, Sonic The Hedgehog, and whatnot I sported games like:</p>
<p>King’s Quest, Space Quest, Monkey Island, Thexder, Silpheed, Downland, Cave Walker, Pooyan, Captain Blood, Zaxxon, EGA Trek, Super Pitfall, Wolfenstein 3D, the Kroz games, Lemmings, Commander Keen, Duke Nukem 1 &amp; 2, Alien Carnage, Ken’s Labyrinth, Jill of the Jungle, Billy the Kid, and a hundred other games from those old Gamefest and Electronic Entertainment (E2) demo CDs. It wasn’t until I was a little older around the looming Sega Saturn era that we finally bought the whole back library: NES, Game Boy, Super NES, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64 and most of the games we missed while growing up.</p>
<p>From then on I was both a console and PC gamer gaming with the likes of Duke Nukem 3D, Dark Forces, Jedi Knight, Star Trek 25th Anniversary, Judgment Rites, Full Throttle, Day of the Tentacle, The Dig, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Mario Kart 64, Turok 2, and Super Smash Bros. Up until the millennium after the N64 died and the upcoming Gamecube didn’t have anything interesting. I avoided the PlayStation although there were games I enjoyed on it (Star Wars Masters of Teras Kasi). I then migrated mostly to a full PC gamer again and played games like Quake 2, Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Unreal, Unreal Tournament, Star Trek Klingon Honour Guard, and Star Trek Elite Force. And later on Half-Life 2, Doom 3, and a few other titles until the Wii finally came out. I then caved and bought it and found out it sucked. Bad. But it was great fun to hack and use homebrew on.</p>
<p>Afterwards I found myself unable to use my computer as much because it was downstairs in the basement and was aging. So I bought a 360 and a PS3 to replace it. Then I acquired a slightly better rig with most of the same hardware except way more RAM and a 300Mhz processor upgrade. This is the rig I’m currently using which still has my ATI X1650 AGP card in it…which is dying (100+ C temperatures during gameplay is not good). I’m now pretty much back to full PC mode again (as in the beginning) and saving up for a better setup that’ll not quiver at the sight of today’s powerful games.</p>

            <p>The first thing I’ve ever played games on was a computer using Windows 98, unless I’m mistaken. I also used to play on a Game Gear and Playstation when I was younger. Regardless, I’ve been computer oriented all my life.</p>

<p>This is a valid argument, but easier to make is not always better.  The PS3 itself proves this, its difficult to code for and has avoided a lot of the shovel-ware of other consoles. It has a smaller software library because of it.</p>
<p>In the end the software difficulty is a double edged sword, easy to code for has its advantages but so does difficulty as far as the consumer is concerned.</p>
<p>But this thread is getting derailed and its a lot my fault.  Back to whether or not you started gaming on PC or console please.</p>

<p>The biggest hole in the “pcs are too expensive” argument is this; these days every modern family owns a computer. And say a decent gaming computer is only 100-200 dollars more expensive than a brand new cheap family computer. So next time you or your parents are going to buy a new computer, pitch in 100-200 dollars to make it a gaming computer and you have now gotten a decent gaming computer for LESS than the cost of a console.</p>

<p>Besides my laptop, we have one PC in the house, an AMD Athlon with 512mb RAM. Since my dad’s working week was cut back during the recession, we can’t afford anything else. It does the job for what he uses it for (emails, banking, etc), but I don’t think I’m likely to get Crysis working on it  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Now a console is at least 200$ throw in a T.V. equvilent of my average monitor and its like 300$ (decent TVs cost more then decent monitors  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) buy an extra controller its 360$ now because you bought the cheapest thing you must pay for LIVE 410$ now.  Oh but now with your fancy downloads you must buy a HDD not just a memory stick 440$  and thats not including batterys or other 100% optional stuff.</p>
<p>Your consoles almost cost as much as my PC AND DO LESS.  Oh wait it does have more of something… 12 year olds</p>

<p>The biggest hole in the “pcs are too expensive” argument is this; these days every modern family owns a computer. And say a decent gaming computer is only 100-200 dollars more expensive than a brand new cheap family computer. So next time you or your parents are going to buy a new computer, pitch in 100-200 dollars to make it a gaming computer and you have now gotten a decent gaming computer for LESS than the cost of a console.</p>

<p>Actually I’ve found console users would still buy a console even if they had the money for a pc.</p>

<p>Ya know PCs are pretty cheap, I bet you could build one for like 300-400$ I don’t think it would be a big problem for your average console gamer.:retard:</p>

            <p>I began with Pong.  Then went to the Atari 2600, then 5200, then 7800.  Then onto ColecoVision.  Finally from there, the NES, the Genesis, the TurboGrafx-16, Game Gear (yeah, shut up, kid), SNES, VirtualBoy (yes, I had one of these), Dreamcast, N64, Playstation 1, Playstation 2…then I kind of fell out of the console market and went exclusively to Quake and then after Quake 2, went on to Half Life.  I haven’t played much in the way of video games since.</p>
