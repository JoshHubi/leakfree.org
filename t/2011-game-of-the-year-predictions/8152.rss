    <description>So this year is finally coming to an end and it has been an awesome one for video games. So many amazing games have come out and I haven&#39;t had a life for the entire year. 

Now that all the big releases are finally out or about to come out, what games do you guys think are GOTY worthy, and what game do you want to win?

IMO, the best games of the year were without a doubt Skyrim, Portal 2, The Witcher 2, Arkham City, Skyward Sword, Deus Ex, and Battlefield 3.

I can&#39;t really say anything about games like Uncharted or Gears of War 3 because I haven&#39;t played them.

Out of all those games, I think Skyrim is going to and should win GOTY, but if Skyrim didn&#39;t win, I&#39;d be happy if the Witcher or Portal 2 did.

Any other predictions for GOTY winners? What were your favorite games and why?</description>

            <p>I think the only thing I can find wrong with Portal 2 was the pricing. IMO, it wasn’t worth the $50 I paid. SP was way too short, and replay value is minimal, at best. MP was actually probably the most fun part of the game, but again there’s little replay value once you’ve done the puzzles, and to enjoy it you and your partner really both need to be figuring them out together for the first time. Dragging someone along isn’t much fun.</p>
<p>I guess those things are kind of intrinsic to the whole genre of puzzle games (IE being good at the puzzle will make the game go faster, and knowing the solution all but eliminates replay value), so I can’t knock Portal 2 too much for that. Still, it kind of irks me that about a week or 2 after release, everyone seemed to realize that the game wasn’t worth that much, and it dropped to like a stone to $20. Wish I would have waited. Oh well. I suppose money spent funding Valve is an alright investment.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Anyway, if it wins GOTY I won’t mind though.</p>

<p>No, Portal had one of the best endings ever, one in which YOU GOT AWAY!  fuck valve for remaking that last scene, and then just dropping you right back where you started just as an easy way to start portal 2.0.  what made portal 2.0’s ending so great? the moon? pff</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>By that logic Portal 2’s ending was amazing too because YOU GOT AWAY! And I agree with Maxey, you’re overcomplicating what these games are supposed to be.</p>

            <p>Am I the only one who thinks Uncharted 3 has a pretty good chance of winning? Even though I have a feeling that Skyrim <span class="bbcode-i">will</span> win, Uncharted was good enough to be strongly considered.</p>

            <p>I think you are trying to make the Portal games a bigger thing than they need to be.</p>
<p>They’re supposed to be small, fun, non-complicated games with light-hearted plots and obviously self-aware parody/satire style humor and what you wanted was a serious, complex sequel with breakthrough innovations and additions which would only make it a completely different game that happens to have a portal gun in it.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not going to argue with what you think of the actual Portal 2 game, however I can say that you were predisposed to be negative against it because it did not fill your own expectations for a sequel to Portal.</p>

<p>I guess that would be relevant if Portal was a sequel to HL2, also wouldn’t the dev costs of HL2 have included the source engine?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and the soundtrack and the atmosphere were good too. Well, that’s my opinion. But it’s definitely not a “typical bloated high budget sequel in Hollywood style”, why? Cause they have fucking taken their god damn time, to create new ideas for it. You should start listening to the interesting developer commentary Valve puts into their games, so you learn how they work.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>don’t care how they work, it was a bad sequel, it only hurt what portal was.</p>
<p>also, there was no progression in 2, in addition to the puzzles never really getting harder or more complex, you knew at the beginning that all you were going to be doing was escaping/sightseeing, and that never changed, yet for some reason you still had to go through all those different test courses.  in Portal, at first you think you’re just a product tester, then slowly you start to see through the cracks in the facade, and realize things aren’t what they seem.</p>
<p>and you can hardly even call portal 2 a sequel, the way they just throw you back down there like portal never happened makes it feel like a mortal kombat type series game.  add a couple new characters, add a couple new moves/capabilities, and make the environment much more visually stunning, rinse repeat.  they could just keep doing this until portal 9.  throw you back down in the hole again, add a new voice actor, revive glados again, make the environment more visually stunning, and there you go, Portal 3, 4, 5…</p>
<p>there’s just such an amazing difference between the two games, I can’t believe that people who played portal when it came out can actually like portal 2.  the difference between making a game because someone has a good idea and wants to make a good game, and making a game to cash in, it sickens me.</p>
<p>if they wanted to do portal 2 right, they would have ditched the whole test-course-with-instructional-voice format, you would have had the portal gun in the actual world, and perhaps decided to go back and bring the fight to Glados to finisher her off, and while doing so, you find some other versions or add-ons to the portal gun laying around in labs…</p>

            <p>My problem isn’t with them liking Halo, my problem is with them trying to shove Halo down your throat.  That is why I stopped my subscription, because I disagreed with their editors on too many things and was tired of them trying to push games that I didn’t like, or sequels of games I didn’t like, on me.</p>

            <p>There have been many good PC games this year but I can’t think of any which deserves a superiority award. Portal 2 is great, but lacks interesting/twitch puzzles. Skyrim is great, but has a horrible UI, unusable map and removes even more RPG mechanics. Human Revolution is good, but was still developed by people that wanted to keep 3rd person ladders, takedowns and bosses because they “looked cool”. The Witcher 2 is great, and yet manages to be inferior to the original in almost every way (awful UI too). Arkham City is great, but far too diluted for its own good. Serious Sam 3 is great, but has a slow start and doesn’t bring anything really new to the table. Rage is great, but the vehicular and transitional sections get boring rather fast - and then the whole game is over before you know it. Dead Space 2 is great, and yet so forgettable that only this very thread reminded me of its existence. Battlefield 3 might be a good multiplayer game, but its singleplayer campaign is so poor that I ragequit. Modern Warfare 3 is… heh.</p>
<p>So I dunno. Most likely personal contender right now is probably The Binding of Isaac. That, or SpaceChem.</p>

            <p>I’ve played quite a bit of every single game mentioned. And Skyward Sword absolutely blew me away. It jumped straight to the top of my favorite video game list. I’d vote for that. It will win at least one award somewhere. It was fanfuckingtastic.</p>

            <p>Witcher 2 is my vote.</p>
<p>Visually stunning, the combat was more than point-and-click, the choice system is the best I’ve ever seen in a game, and CDProjekt does an excellent job of updating and improving the game after release.</p>
<p>The story was a little weaker than the first and the UI was pretty meh, but nothing serious.</p>
<p>Skyrim, Portal 2, and Human Revolution would be my other choices.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, yes, it will win, which will make Activision excited to push out another one. -_-</p>
<p>Oh, and the Halo remake will probably win something too.  OXM, they’re Halo fanboys.  That’s why they don’t get my money anymore.</p>

            <p>is the best cinleplayer shooter from figt years (do not consolling ass game for loosers).<br>
[/QUOTE]<br>
I’m having trouble deciphering this. So far I’m at:<br>
“is the best singleplayer shooter from fight (?) years (not counting console ass games for losers).”</p>
<p>Anybody else having better luck?</p>

            <p>I haven’t played Skyrim yet (I know, I know… I’m just not that into Oblivion, so I figured with Skyrim I’ll just wait for a price-drop).<br>
I really enjoyed Deus Ex although the bossfights and the ending(s) sucked.<br>
So my winner is Portal 2 (co-op in P2 was definitely the most fun I had with a videogame this year).</p>
