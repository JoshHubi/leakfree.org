    <title>Please help me customize FakeFactory&#39;s Cinematic Mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/please-help-me-customize-fakefactorys-cinematic-mod/1730</link>
    <description>i can&#39;t seem to find any specific help with what i want to do on Google or anywhere else i&#39;ve searched. i don&#39;t want to ADD more, i want to REMOVE stuff and RESTORE some of the original material. Without potentially screwing up my installation (which takes an impressive 20-30 minutes) over and over again, i&#39;d rather do it right the first time...or maybe the second.

i just installed FakeFactory&#39;s Cinematic Mod 9.0 and the 9.5 Update. Forget the HD Update. i don&#39;t want any of the new character models.

How can i removeall the material i don&#39;t want/like? i would much rather keep the original music. None of the new HD models were installed by default (thank God) so i don&#39;t need to worry about them. i&#39;d like to -if i can- remove the new and &quot;improved&quot; Civil Protection posters and Dr.Breen propaganda posters from the game (showing his &quot;new and improved&quot; face).

i wanted the mod for the HDR and Bloom effects, as well as the added details thrown into each map. (i LOVE them so far) it should be known that i&#39;m running 32-bit WinXP with only 3.5gig of ram. i haven&#39;t gotten further than the train station in HL2 so if anyone can warn me ahead of time about added details i might not like, fire away.

            <p>Yep. i was right. No music files means no music…at all. They must have updated the maps with ALL NEW music cues. So now i either have to give up all music entirely, stick with the new not-so-great music…or figure out which piece of music played where, what it’s new retarded name is in the FakeFactory files and rename the original music files to match the new maps.</p>
<p><em><span class="bbcode-i">sigh</span></em> Unless someone else has a better idea…</p>

            <p>Can’t play 10, don’t have 64-Bit Windows.</p>
<p>Now as for the music files : i noticed that all the file names are unique in how they don’t fit the same “HL2_song#” format as the original soundtrack. i also noticed different audio cues in the game. Music would play in places it didn’t before.</p>
<ul>
<li>What the hell is “Alyx_Acapella.wav” anyway!? it’s audio of…Alyx?? Singing?? Where do this take place in the game? :fffuuu: -</li>
</ul>
<p>i’m afraid that if i get rid of all the new music, i’ll have a completely quiet game. Since the NEW music names are different, does that mean that new music cues were created for the game’s updated maps? if so, how would the game know which track to play at what time?</p>
<p>i’ll just rename or move the music folder just in case it doesn’t work out.</p>

            <p>Open the folder from steamapps/sourcemods or wherever it is.</p>
<p>You’re going to want to download VTFEdit if you want to be sure of textures you’re going to delete, too.</p>
<p>find “materials/models” and kill the shit out of anything you don’t want as far as default re-textures go.</p>
<p>For all of the new characters and shit, just delete their actual model files, THEN delete their textures after trying the game without them.</p>

            <p>That’s what I meant.<br>
Delete the mod’s files, let the game revert to it’s original ones. A mod like Fakefactory shouldn’t have anything new and special for it to have to run, right?</p>

            <p>You can’t really mess it up if you delete materials from a mod, the game should always revert to the default textures in the .gcf files.</p>

            <p>Look through the game files, and delete the new materials/decals. I dunno where they are exactly, though, so you’ll have to wade through all the mod’s folders.</p>
