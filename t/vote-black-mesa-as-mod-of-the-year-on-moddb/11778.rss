[QUOTE=Op 1/12/2012]
Hi!

You can vote Black Mesa as &quot;Mod of the year&quot; on [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/&#39;]Moddb.com[/url]

How to:

1- [url=&#39;https://www.moddb.com/mods/black-mesa&#39;]Go to Black mesa page on moddb[/url]

2- Click on the banner to vote.

3- You must log-in to vote(if you don&#39;t have an account you can create it)

I know that calling Black Mesa just a &quot;mod&quot; is reductive but the Dev team deserves it!

<p>I had the same thing happening, so I registered and voted. I can hardly believe that this is a coincidence. Possibly a brilliant move on Moddbâ€™s part in terms of recruiting vast amounts of new members in a very short time frameâ€¦ :freeman:</p>

            <p>I too got the waiting message when voting as a guest, but another time the vote went through straight away, I donâ€™t know if it the votes were during the first or second round, or on one on each occasion.</p>
