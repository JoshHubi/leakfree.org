        <title>Goldeneye Remake on Wii</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[MusicallyInspired]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Goldeneye was going to have the same HD remake treatment and 8-man multiplayer online play that the original Perfect Dark got on XBL. But Microsoft and Nintendo couldn’t come to an agreement on Nintendo’s royalties so nothing was done.</p>
<p>So Nintendo and Activision (who holds the Bond game license) decided to screw the original game that Rare made altogether and remake it into a new game for the Wii exclusively thereby forgoing any necessary royalties to Microsoft for the original game. It’s not the original game by any stretch of the imagination. It’s more like a re-imagining. The levels are altered with a similar atmosphere to the originals, but you won’t automatically know which way to go. The story is even altered somewhat from the post-cold war type of medium to a more modern retelling. They used Daniel Craig’s face/voice because they didn’t have the rites to use Brosnan’s likeness anymore. The Klobb (named after one of the original developers Ken Lobb) is also being renamed to the Klebb (after a developer on the new game).</p>
<p>All that said, I’m looking forward to it and am going to give it a chance. I do wish it would have gotten the remake treatment on XBL, though, as well. Or even a virtual console release on Wiiware.</p>

            <p>There was a few screens, or rumors a while ago, that it was coming to xbox live arcade as an updated version, i personally wanted to see that one rather than a wii version, since that one only had better graphics and still kept all the original stuff and gameplay for a lower price.</p>

<p>Ya but did you forget about the stupid extra handle crappy joystick the c buttons would have been better off with a less arrow-ey placement.  IMO the xbox 360 controller is the best controller of any console gamecube is a close second but the c-stick ruins it stupid nipple of an analog stick.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I will probably never get to play this since I dont own a wii, but I would most likely prefer the original due to the N64 controller.  That controller was and is the best console controller for shooters.  The ergonomics and z trigger are genius. With regards to Goldeneye, 1.2 solitaire should have been the default control scheme rather than 1.1 honey.  Honestly, who the fuck looks around using 4 yellow buttons, thats what an analog stick is for.</p>
<p>A little off topic, but I played ALOT of Turok 2. That game was the shit.</p>

            <p>In my opinion this looks very cool. I don’t give a shit about graphics and stuff, just gameplay and it looks really cool. I think it won’t kick the original Goldeneye from my throne (this game is just fantastic, even after all those years), but I think it’s a very cool new interpretation of the original game and they finally can include stuff the couldn’t put into the original game. For example, I missed speach and more story elements.</p>
<p>Is there a release date yet?</p>

            <p>You are describing more of a direct port, this appears to be a remake.  I am sure it is modified to take advantage of the wii mote, I think the controls are going to be completely different.</p>

<p>…Anyway, am I the only person who thinks Goldeneyes aiming is outdated and annoying?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that is why they are remaking it.  I am sure the controls will be updated, its not like the N64 controller is still used today.  Maybe I dont understand your point, but Goldeneye is just like any other FPS and can be updated to contend with today’s games.</p>
<p>Who cares how old Goldeneye64 is, this is Goldeneye Wii.  Regardless, IMO the graphics are decent at best and the game does not look like more fun than N64.</p>

            <p>Yes, it is outdated today, but back then it was a classic. Most people have memories of this game, and it is trying to appeal to them. Doom is primative by today’s standards, but I doubt you will find many people who will insult it.</p>

            <p>I think it also has to do with console limitations, but we will have to disagree.</p>

            <p>I only think that is true because of a lack of developer support it has nothing to do with the Wii itself.  Most devs would rather just make shovel ware for the wii because it will sell anyways</p>

            <p>I’m just going to go ahead and predict worthless nostalgics will love it and it will be worthless.<br>
As a side note, Wii FPSs are far below any other console’s FPSs, and they are behind PC FPSs.</p>
