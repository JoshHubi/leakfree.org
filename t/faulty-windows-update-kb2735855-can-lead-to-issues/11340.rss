    <description>ATTENTION users who are experiencing broken cube / maps / textures / props, missing weapon models, a [b]high[/b] frequency of crashes.
You may be a victim of a bad download due to dropped packets and faulty download execution within your browser as a result of a recent Microsoft Windows Update &quot;KB2735855&quot;!

 
Microsoft has acknowledged that the WINDOWS Update &quot;KB2735855&quot; (for windows 7/8 [32 and 64bit]) is faulty. This update can lead to corrupted downloads within your browser.
This [b]could[/b] explain some of the problems that our users are seeing with a functioning but extremely buggy game.
The support site for the update is here: [url]https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2735855[/url]  Please read and choose if this applies to you.

            <p>a reminder - this is NOT our response to the occasional crash that can happen to some people.<br>
those crashes are our fault and we are actively working on fixing them as we speak.</p>
<p>this is for weird shit like purple/black square textures, missing sounds, missing models.<br>
generall stuff that looks and feels “obviously” broken and not part of the game.</p>
