    <description>Hello!

I haven&#39;t been posting on this forum for a long time, because of some serious IRL stuff, but I am working on [i]Vanity[/i], which is, from the topic title, &quot;A Hectic Retro-Style blood-filled neon-lights-everywhere box murder simulator&quot;.

I have a whole page that talks about it on IndieDB, along with a download, a video, a piece from the [i]fucking awesome[/i] soundtrack, and where I will be posting updates!

[url]https://www.indiedb.com/games/vanity[/url]

I wanted your opinion, some feedback, or suggestions on the game to help make it better while I am working on it!

Also, not everything is finished: Bosses 4 and 5 aren&#39;t made yet, and the challenges screen isn&#39;t made either, so hang tight!  :wink:</description>
