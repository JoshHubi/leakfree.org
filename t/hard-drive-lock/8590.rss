    <title>Hard Drive Lock</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/hard-drive-lock/8590</link>
    <description>I recently found an old laptop lying around and didn&#39;t remember the password, so I wiped the HDD and installed Ubuntu on it. The problem is, originally when I started the computer up it went to a gray screen asking for a password to unlock the hard drive and it&#39;s still doing it despite me formatting the drive. How exactly do I go about removing this screen from Ubuntu?

Edit: Never mind. I got it.</description>

            <p>Well the majority of the links I found when I originally searched Google were how to find out the password for the page if you didn’t know it, which I did know the password. I eventually stumbled on a site (where you pay them and they find your password for you) that said all you had to do was go into the BIOS and disable it.</p>
