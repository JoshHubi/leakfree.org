    <title>Half-Life: Decay thoughts and opinions.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/half-life-decay-thoughts-and-opinions/9244</link>
    <description>I googled Half-Life: Decay today expecting to find reviews+thoughts and opinions. And I was disappointed to find that there was very few, since it is the least known official Half-Life expansion. 
So I&#39;m wondering what you guys thought of the expansion. Did you ever play it? If so, was it the official PlayStation 2 version, or the Half-Life mod for it? Did you find it fun? Or challenging? Or just stupid.</description>

            <p>I know right? it’s always better to play with friends in the same room than over a mic. It makes the game more…entertaining, so you can joke, laugh, and just overall have a good time, instead of listening to some whiney little kid on a microphone who thinks he’s the shit because he plays call of duty.</p>
<p>not to mention if you both play on the same machine, that right there eliminates the “You have something on!” argument, or the “Damn lag is killing me.” Argument. It’s straight up skill.</p>

            <p>Decay came with the Ps2 version of Half life. Honestly, I played through it and enjoyed it. once alone and once with a friend. He was always fun to play games with. More often than not we’d be playing a game and the game would get hectic and I’d be shouting something like “shoot the fast one shoot the fast one!” Trying to maintain my distance from said threat while I reload a double barrel shotgun. Anyways, off topic there.</p>
<p>As I was saying, For those who have a PS2, I recommend going to Ebay or your nearest electronic specialty store that has old games (no other way to find it) and picking up a copy. It’s rare, but worth it to add it to your gaming collection.</p>

            <p>Decay is really important for understand the story of how badly Gman fucked over Black Mesa’s containment parameters. It’s easily has the most compelling introduction out of all the expansions; listening to Rosenberg bicker at Keller about how arrogant Breen’s disregard of safety precautions are was easily the most fascinating dialogue to listen to…</p>
<p>In fact, almost all of Rosenberg’s dialogue ties in incredibly well with all the scientists in the original Half Life insinuating that the dampening fields aren’t calibrated well, or about how the containment parameters may not be nominal.</p>
<p>And you get a better feel for how Breen had the crystal that Colette escorted replaced with the unstable sample - at Gman’s request. Once again, ties in well with the scientists questioning the origin of the “new sample” in the original game.</p>
<p>The game was definitely interesting, and is worth playing.</p>

            <p>You can’t play Decay(PC-Port) with one player, even though you can toggle between players you would need 2 active players at the same time to get through some of the early puzzles, an example would be where one has to turn a valve while the other player moves forward, otherwise the air would push down the player and you don’t have enough time to go through if you switch players.</p>

<p>You don’t need another person to play through the PC Port. You can toggle between characters. So, you play through the game as one or the other character, then periodically toggle to the other character when you need her to solve a puzzle. It’s a bit clunky, but it’s not too bad. It would have worked better if the second player controlled character would follow when not being player controlled, like some friendly NPCs in other HL games.</p>

            <p>I give it a 8/10 playing with someone who is serious. Interesting, and good story. Has Rosenburg from Blue Shift in it. It is like Blue-Shift and Opposing Force though, made by Gearbox and not officially considered “cannon”.</p>
<p>It could have used more exciting firefights, with ways to endorse Co-Op fighting, but had good enough puzzles for the 2. For a Co-Op game at that time it was good.</p>
<p>Overall, fuck it, you can download the PC port for free so why NOT get it?</p>

            <p>Decay was…an interesting experiment, to say the least, but I wouldn’t recommend to anyone who wants a “true” Half Life experience, since most of the atmosphere was created when you were alone</p>

            <p>I play Half-Life: Decay on the PS2 version, mainly because I can’t get my controller to work right on the PC version so me and my bro can do split-screen. I’m still trying to get my Steam friends to buy HL1 so we could do something  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If I had to decide what I would rate it, 8/10 if you have a buddy who actually <span class="bbcode-i">knows</span> how to play Half-Life. 6/10 if you have a terrible player.</p>

            <p>I googled Half-Life: Decay today expecting to find reviews+thoughts and opinions. And I was disappointed to find that there was very few, since it is the least known official Half-Life expansion.<br>
So I’m wondering what you guys thought of the expansion. Did you ever play it? If so, was it the official PlayStation 2 version, or the Half-Life mod for it? Did you find it fun? Or challenging? Or just stupid.</p>
