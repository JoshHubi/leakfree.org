    <title>Sandy Bridge Question</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/sandy-bridge-question/6793</link>
    <description>I want to build a new PC with an i5 2500k and a p67 mobo.

However, I won&#39;t be buying a graphics card soon because I don&#39;t have enough $$$.

I read somewhere else that P67 mobos need a dedicated graphics card,and they won&#39;t run without it, neglecting the integrated graphics that come withing the cpu itself.

Is this true? Does this setup NEED a dedicated gfx card?</description>

            <p>Yep UK has them too. BTW Acade366 your sig is awesome, that baby literally shits himself lol!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/russilker">@russilker</a> - Overclocking probably not necessary but then it wasn’t necessary to push the old core2duo’s to 4Ghz when they first came out, now you are glad of the extra power. It makes little difference to gaming though if you have a resolution of over 1280x720 as the GPU starts to become the bottlekneck.<br>
Many overclock as a hobby, just to push the limites and see what’s possible. Overclockers UK are selling pre-overclocked Sandybridge bundles at 4.6Ghz, I can’t believe that’s safe for a 24/7 clock as voltages are probably too high.</p>

            <p>I’d wait anyway there is a faut in almost every sandy bridge motherboard including laptops made with them, and they have been recalled. they are releaseing new ones after april so i would wait and if you’ve ordered one and are waiting for it i would can it…</p>

            <p>Is overclocking Sandy Bridge processors really necessary? With the older generation i7 processors I might understand, but I really don’t think overclockability should decide whether or not you buy a certain Sandy Bridge chipset.</p>

            <p>I have no idea why anyone would want to use intels onboard graphics solution, fps in games newer than 2004 is all over the place, in almost every game it jumps from full speed to 5fps depending of the amount of stuff on screen due to the absence of hardware T&amp;L</p>

            <p>Well at this rate you would have to wait in any case. I have been waiting for my order for over a month now and it seems that i need to wait at least 2 more weeks for the shop to get anything in stock</p>

            <p>Intel really steers the user with Sandy Bridge. You can’t really overclock any other cpu than the ones with the K and also need a special chipset to overclock. You can wait for the X67 chipset if you want to overclock and use the internal gpu.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The fact about the P67 motherboard needing an extra 3D card is correct. I’m not sure why (intel must have their reasons):</p>
<p>P67 - Chipset provides enhanced overclocking features that allow you to mess with the multiplier a lot more. No facility to use the onboard GPU.</p>
<p>H67 - Limited overclock but has the bits needed to use the onboard GPU.</p>
<p>The Sandybridge chips themselves house the GPU, they are what is known as APU’s now (CPU+GPU). If you want to use the onboard graphics you will need to buy a H67 board but unfortunately that will limit the potential of that i5-2500K as you won’t be able to overclock it much.</p>
<p>Save the extra few dollars and get something for in between is my advice. Something like a 5570 or 5670 if you can find one cheap enough, should be $80 max for the 5670.</p>

            <p>what I read was that no P67 mobo has any kind of video output.</p>
<p>I wanted to confirm/deny that.</p>

            <p>if the mobo has a vga/dvi/hdmi port, you should be fine</p>
<p>if not then obviously there is no integrated graphics</p>
