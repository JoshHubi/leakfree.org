    <title>Ship Black Mesa with libtcmalloc_minimal on Linux?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/ship-black-mesa-with-libtcmalloc-minimal-on-linux/15361</link>
    <description>I run Black Mesa on Linux using [url=&#39;https://flatpak.org/&#39;]Flatpak[/url]&#39;s distribution of Steam. A few days ago, the game worked fine. However, as of April 29th, the game will not launch and from the terminal I get the error

/home/edwargix/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/steamapps/common/Black Mesa/bms_linux: error while loading shared libraries: libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


I&#39;ve seen this error before; Portal 2 had this [url=&#39;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/portal2/issues/227&#39;]issue[/url] a while back, and solved it by shipping libtcmalloc_minimal.so with the game. Would it be possible for Black Mesa to do the same?


Thanks

BTW, since Flatpak maintains its own libraries and sandboxes its applications, I unfortuneately can&#39;t simply install libtcmalloc on my distro</description>

            <p>I ended up manually installing this library, and the game started after doing so.</p>
<p>No sound, many black/missing textures, numerous lighting issues, enabling antialiasing drops performance drastically and introduces graphical glitches.</p>

<p>I have requested a refund. I might buy this game again later if these issues are fixed, but I consider the Linux version unplayable in current form.</p>
