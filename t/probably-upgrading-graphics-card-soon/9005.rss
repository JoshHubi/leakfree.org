    <title>Probably Upgrading Graphics Card Soon</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/probably-upgrading-graphics-card-soon/9005</link>
    <description>So I recently got a job and, since I&#39;ll have the money, would like to upgrade my card. I currently have an HD5870, which runs games fine mind you.

I was thinking of either a GTX 670 or a GTX 680. I&#39;m kind of leaning towards the 670 as it costs quite a bit less at a very minimal performance drop, at least from the benchmarks I&#39;ve seen. Going with Nvidia this time because their drivers are apparently miles ahead of AMD and for Physx. [url=&#39;https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130787&#39;]This[/url] was the card I was looking at, factory overclocked. Just wanted to put this up to get opinions.

Edit: I have an 800 watt Corsair power supply as well. I&#39;m thinking that should be enough as the card recommends 500 watts.</description>

            <p>Please, for the love of god, check craigslist first, if that is an option. I recently got my GTX570 for $100 from some hard-up, down-on-his-luck bloke on CR… always worth a shot…</p>
<p>No, a 570 is not 670 or 680, but at hundreds less, it is plenty enough card to run anything current on max.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

            <p>So should I get the overclocked version or the standard version. From what I’ve seen, the normal version operates almost always at around the same level as the overclocked version because of some power saving thing that Nvidia has put into their GPUs. In the benchmarks I’ve seen the two are usually only separated by 1 or 2 frames per second. Here:</p>
