I&#39;ve had my GF for 2 years now (practically lives with me) - small white, petite thang, cooks for me, always been good to me.

I go away on holiday for a week, come back and something just doesn&#39;t seem right. I asked my Father if he had seen anything happen with my GF and he acts clueless.

So fast forward to 3 weeks later... I&#39;m coming home from work when BAM clear as day, right in my Kitchen I catch my Father red handed with his meat in my GF.

I was lalalalaed, told him to get his meat out of GF and lalalala, needless to say my GF got turned off. I just couldn&#39;t get over it and that night kicked my GF to the curb.

Now it&#39;s been 2 weeks since the incident and that I&#39;ve been without my GF and about 10 minutes ago my Father had the audacity to ask my how my GF has been, when he&#39;s the damn reason we ain&#39;t together no more.

Should I get off the computer and start swinging at him?

OR

Pack my stuff and be on my way.

Here&#39;s pics of my GF for you guys as I know you&#39;ll ask.

<p>The story itself fails. Why the hell would u kick out ur grill just cause ur dad has his meat in it? U could always wash it out. If the story definitely makes it should like the grill was a human. The story would have succeed if it was on an equilibrium where we don’t know if its a grill or a girl friend. But this story made it sound more like a grill so therefore it fails and furthermore it is also not welcome on this forum or even on the Internets.</p>
