    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/whats-cannonic-and-whats-not/7953</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen people claiming that some expansions are not canonical(Opossing Force per example) Well, I would like to know what is really canon and what not.

Is Blue Shift canon? And Decay?</description>

            <p>Lol. Of course I spelled it cannon after that.  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><span class="mention">@Xalaner</span>: Conveniently looking away? You mean fighting for your life in a secret complex underground? Not really the kind of scenario where you’d know what was going on anywhere else. You take this as a negative, for me it’s a realistic positive.</p>
<p>“Mention black mesa a few times, give some old generic NPCs names and personality, you’re gold.”</p>
<p>You say this as if its such a simple, obvious thing to do that would automatically work. Like you could just do it with any game sequel you like. Fleshing out a vague story retroactively without actually cheapening the experience isn’t easy to do.</p>
<p>Also, its with Valves self depricating view of their old technology that actually gives them merit, and again adds to the depth of the series lore and the community that follows it. Having Barney with the same face as HL again fleshed out the original whilst never cheapening the experience. Something not easy to do. As much as you seem to wish to believe.</p>

<p>That’s the thing. Half life 1 had damn near no plot points, and Half life 2 had to invent a bunch of shit that happened in HL1 when you were conveniently looking away. Breen, for example.<br>
The basic premise is that “the BM incident left one portal open and more shit came through.” Mention black mesa a few times, give some old generic NPCs names and personality, you’re gold.<br>

<p>Next thing you know, Half life 3 is gonna come out with a major character named Mike. One of the recycled citizen models. “remember when we thought the combine war was as bad as it could get?”</p>

</aside>
<p>I understand, and you’re right. Some things in HL2 didn’t make a whole lot of sense, probably because back when they made HL1, Valve couldn’t have known if the game was going to be successful enough for them to be able to make a sequel. But the series did become successful, so if they were going to make a sequel, they would have to go <span class="bbcode-i">somewhere</span> with the story. Putting HL2 back in Black Mesa would have made no sense, so they had to come up with a story based on the elements of HL1. It could have been anything and we could still say it was a silly extrapolation. They could have had G-Man put Gordon on alien worlds to fight monsters alone again, or had him fighting governments and their conspiracies. And of course, any style was going to please some people and alienate others. But with games like Halo and Deus Ex already immensely popular, I think they didn’t want to seem like they were now content to be band-wagoners, and decided to do something ground-breaking again. Just my 2 cents on the whole thing.</p>

            <p>Personally I don’t see why the add ons can’t be cannon.</p>
<p>The biggest changes are made by OP4, and these can be looked over with little implications into the main story line.</p>
<p>The changing of generic marines to the HECU could well be seen that the vast majority of troops in Black Mesa are marines, whilst the HECU were called in when things went really tits up.</p>
<p>Race X could well be a tiny, cult like sect of aliens living in Xen. Clearly advanced in technology ( in terms of bio engineering ) they could well of been stranded on Xen, and ‘refused’ to join the Nihilanth. Now hunted to near extinction by the Nihilanth they use guerilla tactics with bioengineered forces. Only able to use their teleport and tunneling device when the Nihilanth is too busy with its own invasion and Freeman.</p>
<p>As for the barnacle gun, I just think of it as being attached to something. Something with some kind of electricity that passes through it in order to get a reaction out of the barnacle.</p>

            <p>So if they don’t include it in a game, it’s not part of its plot. You cannot make any suppositions about canon, then. There’s no canon, just what you see in the games, the rest is there waiting for being used(or not) in a future game. Isn’t it?</p>

<p>Half life has no fucking cannon. 85% of it’s ongoing story line consists of retcon. Fuck, Half life 2 was 100% retcon.</p>
<p>Deal widdit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Im not familiar with the term retcon, but I think what you are saying is that the majority of the story in the HL saga is built upon mystery and extreme vagueness… almost to the point at which you wonder if Valve even knows what the details of the story really are. So basically its easy to say that mostly everything in the expansions could be considered canon.</p>

<p>Thanks for being one of the few people with common sense man  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If the mod were dead then i would immediately move on from it and continue on the many other projects i could do to add to my portfolio. If it was dead, it would also state so on the Moddb page… so unless anyone sees that notification, its not dead.</p>

            <p>We can argue about Canon until the cows come home (which is never, because we don’t have any) but my personal view of HL canon goes as follows:<br>
HL is canon. (Except for the choice of model for Doctor Kleiner; he should be one of the Walter/Glasses scientists, not one of the Einstein scientists)<br>
Adrian Shepard and some of his adventures are canon. Race X, seeing Freeman, and the barnacle grappling hook are not.<br>
Blue shift is canon. (Doctor Rosenberg’s whereabouts are unknown)<br>
Decay is again partially canon. I don’t think there was a chamber under the test chamber, and the hazard course is a bit off if you compare it to Op4, but most of the events seem to match up fairly well.</p>
