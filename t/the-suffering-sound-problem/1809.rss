    <title>The Suffering sound problem</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-suffering-sound-problem/1809</link>
    <description>The Suffering was recently released as free.  I figured I&#39;d download it and give it a try.

However, I have this annoying problem with the sound.  Randomly, certain sounds, usually gunfire and dialog, totally drops out.  I have no idea why this would happen.  I tried disabling onboard sound, but I got no sound at all afterwards.

Anyone have the slightest clue what&#39;s going on?</description>

            <p>I’ve done that already and it got rid of the more pressing sound problem, but the sound still drops out at points.</p>

            <p>From another board:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I think I’ve got a solution for ya. Open Run(start&gt;all programs&gt;accessories&gt;run) type in RegEdit hit OK. In there hit HK_LOCAL_MACHINE. Then SOFTWARE. Scroll down and click Surreal, then Riot Engine. Delete SettingsDX105. Once you do that, run The Suffering again and the box that pops up when you first run it that asks you to config will come up. Reconfig your video however you had it. Then under the audio tab, uncheck the box next to Use 3D Sound Buffers. That’s what worked for me.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work you can do it again and try configging it in other ways. Hope this helped.</p>
