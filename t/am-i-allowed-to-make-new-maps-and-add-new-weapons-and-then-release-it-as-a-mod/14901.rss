    <title>Am I allowed to make new maps and add new weapons, and then release it as a mod?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/am-i-allowed-to-make-new-maps-and-add-new-weapons-and-then-release-it-as-a-mod/14901</link>
    <description>I know that the free version of this game has a CC license, but I think it is important to make sure.
I&#39;m planning to make a mod using the free BMS mod and make new maps (the original BMS maps won&#39;t be included).
I&#39;m also planning to make new weapons (original BMS weapons included).
If you give me permission, I will of course give you credit.
So, am I allowed to release it as  a mod?</description>

<p>Just pakrat them into a map and use the same path as the original weapons and you can change the scripts.<br>
Unless you’re planning on making custom code for it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The devs are working on getting the custom file system working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I get what you mean, but I just feel like it would fit more on the workshop, than a mod at moddb, since workshop is so much easier to use.</p>

<p>Why not just release it on Black Mesa workshop?</p>
<p>With some tweaks you can modify the original weapons and for new models/materials/sounds you just have to import them to the black mesa folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get a fancy updated source engine with modifications to lighting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for your reply, mate! I own BMS on Steam. But I found the free version easier to use, when it comes to making new weapons.</p>
