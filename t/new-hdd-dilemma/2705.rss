    <title>New HDD dilemma</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/new-hdd-dilemma/2705</link>
    <description>So, I have a question for you guys, I&#39;d love your opinions.
Atm my laptop only has a 250Gb hard disc, and I&#39;ve been gagging for more space for some time now, I keep having to uninstall games, and rarely have more than 10Gb free. So I&#39;ve been looking at 2 options.



[b]1. An desktop external drive. Not a portable, the kind with a power cable. For my budget, [url=&#39;https://www.pixmania.co.uk/uk/uk/2763332/art/seagate/expansion-1-tb-usb-2-0-ex.html?srcid=867&#39;]I can get a 1Tb drive[/url], but would struggle with desk space for it.

2. My laptop has a spare bay, so I have the option of a second internal drive. The one [url=&#39;https://www.uk-computers.co.uk/product/WD+Scorpio+Blue+WD5000BEVT+%7B49%7D+hard+drive+%7B49%7D+500+GB+%7B49%7D+SATA%7B49%7D300+WD5000BEVT&#39;]I&#39;m looking at is 500Gb[/url], and slightly less cost wise &gt;.&gt;[/b]



I think most people would go for the external instantly, but my problem is that most of my media has already had to be moved to a friends portable hd, due to my space woes. What I&#39;m trying to say is that, I&#39;m leaning towards an internal for the faster seek speed, the ability to use all that extra space for windows to move around, and gaming. You can&#39;t do that on an external. I mean, the external spins faster than the internal, but there&#39;s that damn usb...

Is it worth taking the hit of smaller capacity?

Thanks in advance guys  :slight_smile:

            <p>0,75T is just fine. Of course depends on how much shit you plan on stuffing in there. My PC only has 0,5T and so far hadn’t had to worry about lack of space much other than remembering to empty the fraps folder that has munched 100GB space. Besides, from my experience, any LOOSE piece of electronic hardware has a high tendency of falling and breaking.<br>
Oh, so what I’m saying, internal.</p>

            <p>It depends on what you want to use it for, really.<br>
If it’s for media, then the external HDD.<br>
But if it’s for installing applications, as you are planning on doing, then the internal one definitely.</p>
