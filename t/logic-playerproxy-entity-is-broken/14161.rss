    <title>logic_playerproxy Entity Is Broken</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/logic-playerproxy-entity-is-broken/14161</link>
    <description>The logic_playerproxy entity is completely broken, as reported in [url=&#39;https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28260-logic-playerproxy-broken-in-BM-2015/&#39;]this thread[/url]. I&#39;m including a bug report thread here since it&#39;s a bug, and I feel like I should more formally report it in the bug report forum.

Although this issue does not appear to cause any noticeable problems in the stock maps, it is a huge hindrance to anyone who needs the functionality of logic_playerproxy in any custom map.

[b]To reproduce:[/b]
Make a map with logic_playerproxy and an ambient_generic in it (let&#39;s call it &quot;amb&quot;) and rig an output: [b]PlayerDied =&gt; amb, PlaySound[/b]. Run the map and type &quot;kill&quot; in the console.

[b]Expected results:[/b]
You die, and the ambient_generic should play a sound.

[b]Actual results:[/b]
You die, and nothing else happens.

So far I&#39;ve verified this issue with the PlayerDied, OnFlashlightOn, OnFlashlightOff, and SetDamageFilter inputs/outputs.</description>
