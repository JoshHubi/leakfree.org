        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What I did was run BOTH source sdk base 2006 and 2007.<br>
This makes them appear in the username folder in steamapps, which in turn makes Black Mesa appear. Hope this helps</p>
<p><em>edit</em> Oh and I started downloading HL2, dunno if that helped too</p>

<p>The Black Mesa team didn’t dictate the installation requirements, and their .exe installer was as straight-forward as it could have possibly been, it even detected that I have steam installed to a non-standard location. If you’re having this many problems with it then you’re most likely not reading the directions properly.</p>
<p>But, since you won’t reply, just a word for anyone else who might read this: Don’t be this guy, no one likes this guy.</p>

<p>Steam looks for a gameinfo.txt file in Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/<em>modnamehere</em>/gameinfo.txt. That’s what it uses to add it to the steam list of games. Also for the record, the Black Mesa folder needs to be named ‘bms’.<br>
If Steam isn’t detecting it at all, that may actually be an issue with Steam, rather than the game. Just having a properly-formatted gameinfo.txt in that folder should cause something to be listed.</p>

<p>OK, I have the same problem discussed here.  And I do have a file named Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/BMS/gameinfo.txt.  But it is not on my list of games in Steam. I have restarted Steam many times, restarted my system…don’t know what else to do.</p>
<p>I did notice that the actual  hl2 exe file is located in Steam/steamapps/myusername/source sdk base 2007 – is that right?</p>
<p>I used the default download paths, so I don’t see why any of it would be wrong.</p>
