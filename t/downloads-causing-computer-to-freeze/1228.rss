    <title>Downloads Causing Computer to Freeze</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/downloads-causing-computer-to-freeze/1228</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if this should go in this forum or the help forum so move it if it&#39;s in the wrong place.

This has been happening for awhile and I&#39;ve asked on other forums but never got a good answer. Basically, downloading almost anything causes my computer to freeze, be it on Steam, BT, and sometimes during direct download. One Steam I can usually download for around 30 seconds to a minute before it freezes, BT usually freezes my computer right when it starts, and it varies for DD.

As an example, earlier today I was downloading a TF2 update and had to pause the download every 30 seconds or so to keep my computer from freezing. As you can probably imagine this gets very annoying very quickly.

I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s my router, an SMC USB router since it began shortly after installing it. Though I&#39;m not sure if a router can cause an entire computer to freeze. I would prefer to not have to mess with the computer too much as my parents and brother use this computer as well.

It&#39;s kind of strange because I can play online games without it crashing which you&#39;d think would put more strain on the connection than downloading. And also just being on the internet sometimes freezes the computer. For example, Youtube doesn&#39;t really work all that well.

I&#39;m running Windows XP SP2 (not sure about the SP). My router is an SMC USB router. My ISP is Road Runner.</description>

            <p>Did anyone mention it could be the antivirus crashing it up? It could make sense since it scans newly downloaded files. Try disabling it maybe.</p>
<p>I read the posts pretty quick, maybe I missed something though…</p>

            <p>It seems my computer is older than I thought. In the system menu of the control panel it says my Windows XP is from 2002.  And before, I used sort of the same thing that I’m using now but it stood up straight. I don’t feel like messing with the computer too much so I’m just going to conclude that it’s from age. Anyway, thanks for your help  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  .</p>

            <p>You have to install a new ethernet or wifi card, your current network card is obviously dead, this happens quite often too.</p>
<p>Or at least try a different USB port.</p>

            <p>If it’s newer then 3 years old or so it should be fine, thought it might be a 6 year old thing.<br>
Wait, a usb router? Do you mean a wireless network device that plugs in via usb, or the router plugs into your usb port, because usb isn’t a exactly network interface.</p>

            <p>It’s not a crappy computer. I was able to download anything perfectly fine up until we got a new router which is what leads me to believe that’s the cause. I’ll get the specs tomorrow. What do you need to know about it?</p>
