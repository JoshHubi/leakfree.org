    <title>Level selection after crash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/level-selection-after-crash/10929</link>
    <description>Every time the game crashes, for whatever reason (like, spawning an NPC with a non-weapon equipment rofl) the game does not record the levels up to the point of the crash - for example, I completed the game some days ago, then I went toying with weapons and the game crashed; when starting a new game, it showed me only the levels up to the last time I quit BM, not up to Lambda Core.
I tried crashing the game on purpose, quitting the game at another level, and it did the same thing.
I don&#39;t know if this is a &quot;normal&quot; error with Source and it is also in HL2, but I can&#39;t find it on the net and I never noticed it xd

And oh, by the way (don&#39;t want to make another thread only for this) when starting the game or loading a save it shows the classic pink-black &quot;missing texture&quot; image.. can I fix this? xD</description>

            <p>No, there’s no need in it now, I’ve got ad understanding what’s all this buzz about :-). Hadn’t hit this one on the boxes I run the game on thus it reall could possibly be a currupted game installation. Then again, maybe not - we can’t tell for sure until you try to reinstall or ensure that your installation is OK in some other way ;-).</p>

            <p>^ Yeah, exactly. Looks like one of them can’t be loaded or it’s missing, maybe my installation is corrupted xd</p>
<p>Anyway, if you really want, I can try to make a video as soon as I get some time on it :L</p>

<p>Em, I still don’t get it, TBH. What is the “blurred” background you’re talking about? As far as I can tell by default the game uses full-blown maps as the backgrounds named background01, background02 and so on up to background14. Could you please provide a screenshot after all so it would more clear what’s the problem you’re talking about. Or - even better - a video on youtube illustrating the problem.</p>

</aside>
<p>It seems it happens only with some chapters “selected” as background for the main menu, the game doesn’t load the blurred image used and replaces it with the ‘missing’ texture; It happens both when launching the game and loading a savegame, so it starts as soon as Steam launches, fades out when the loading of the main menu finishes and reappear when loading a save. Loading a game after being ingame also has the same effect if the game still has that level background loaded in.<br>
I can post a screen about it, but I think I gave you the idea of what I mean xD<br>
So far it happens to me only (and always) with Residue Processing, the red-dust canyon with the tower at the start of the level.<br>
The strange thing is, it shows the blurred image for a split second before loading the menu, then changes to the pink and black texture. Boh…</p>
<p>PC specs are Win7Pro 64-bit, AMD Athlon 5050e, 2Gb RAM, ATI Radeon HD 4600 S., BMS installed into the default directory, Steam ditto. No particular thing happened ingame before I noticed the bug.</p>

            <p>I’m pretty sure you can access all the available chapters after typing sv_unlockedchapters 14 in the console, hopefully this issue will be patched in a future release.</p>
