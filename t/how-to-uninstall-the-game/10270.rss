    <title>How to uninstall the game?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/how-to-uninstall-the-game/10270</link>
    <description>Hello there.

I have a little problem- I can&#39;t uninstall the Black Mesa. The point is that there is no &quot;Black Mesa&quot; in Window&#39;s uninstalling thing, and I can&#39;t also delete the game via Steam since for some reason there is no &quot;delete local content&quot; button for Black Mesa.

Of course I can manually delete files from ...Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\BMS but this is not the right way to delete applications since it will leave some junk information in Window&#39;s registry.

Please help me.</description>
