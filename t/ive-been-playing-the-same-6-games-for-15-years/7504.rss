            <p>i ment to say that ive pretty much have only played these games and their sequels. i say their the same game because they are ( with a few exceptions)<br>
duke nuke- aliens stole women<br>
doom- demons from hell are causing havoc<br>
quake- well, thats the exeption<br>
half life- your a scientist who shoots guns and solves puzzles<br>
tomb raider- you steal tresure and kill mummies</p>
<p>ive tried other games but i never got into them also, i dont have much time to play games.</p>
<p>also, your life is better now that you play video games? ok.</p>
<p>ill check into looking glass</p>

<p>He’s just telling us a fancy fact, dude. I thought it was interesting, I’ve had hundreds of video games, so its pretty interesting to see someone who’s still stuck with the classics.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing it with us.</p>

<p>I gotta admit, I play the same couple of classics too. I’ll often find myself playing Half-life, Jedi Knight II, Starcraft, Warcraft II, and Resident Evil and Silent Hill 2 again and time again. I think it’s because games today suck so severely that old games are the only thing to keep our attention over the years.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s probably why there’s so damn many remakes of old games.</p>
<p>I find myself playing KOTOR, Metal Gear Solid, any of the Jedi Knight series, and Half Life a lot though.</p>

            <p>I am playing all the time the half-life saga, Portal saga, Dark Forces saga (incluiding Jedi knight II and Outcast) Tomb Raider: Last revelation and no more. But I have played the great Quake II only some years ago and some games of the Game boy. But actually I only play the firsts games. I hope that some day could play again Little Big Adventure I an II some day :3</p>

            <p>My problems with the new games are that they cost the same as before but instead of helluva long game time you get some linear shit or button mashing which can be played through in 6-7 hours. For example: Force Unleashed 2.Games in my country cost 12k Forints which is a lot, we don’t earn too much… Why pay 1/8 of my payment for a game I can finish in an afternoon?</p>

            <p>I’ve played at least 50 games in the past ten years and am better for it. You’re an idiot if you only stick to a few, and even more so if you stick to “classics”.</p>

<p>I gotta admit, I play the same couple of classics too. I’ll often find myself playing Half-life, Jedi Knight II, Starcraft, Warcraft II, and Resident Evil and Silent Hill 2 again and time again. I think it’s because games today suck so severely that old games are the only thing to keep our attention over the years.</p>

<p>He’s just telling us a fancy fact, dude. I thought it was interesting, I’ve had hundreds of video games, so its pretty interesting to see someone who’s still stuck with the classics.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing it with us.</p>
