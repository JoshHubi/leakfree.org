    <title>Will 3D be the next big thing?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/will-3d-be-the-next-big-thing/3858</link>
    <description>So as I&#39;m sure you all know, more and more movies are being shown in 3D, there are a number of 3D TV&#39;s being produced, and we will soon have the Nintendo 3DS on our hands. My questions to you are:

[b]1. Do you enjoy 3D entertainment?

2. Do you think 3D will be the next big change to entertainment? Will it have an impact like HD did, or will it be a quickly forgotten trifle like the Virtual Boy?

3. What would it take for you to adopt 3D hardware/software?[/b]

For me, I&#39;d say:

1. Yes, but only recently. Back when 3D was first getting started (like in those horrible Sea World movies), it was really gimmicky. You were only there for the 3D, so the story was supporting the 3D and that of course was awful. I thought it would never go anywhere. Recently though, after having seen a few made for 3D movies, I&#39;m rather amazed how much it added to the atmosphere for me. Even with the clunky glasses, I felt one step closer to actually being there. For movies I already loved it added more.

2. Hard to say. It&#39;s looking more and more that it will be just looking at how much the entertainment industries are pushing it, but it&#39;s not a given yet.

3. Cheaper prices, less intrusion. Once 3D stuff costs only a little more than current hardware and software, and doesn&#39;t require you to wear special glasses, then I will begin to adopt. Until then I will just leave it for the theater.

What do you think?</description>

<p>I would have assumed that production companies would be willing to front the cash and push 3D in hopes of big returns.  3D is so gimmicky and the ignorant public eats it up.  Who is pushing the 3D agenda?</p>

</aside>
<p>So what?  Its all progessive.  Virtual reality is entertainment endgame with 3D simply being a link in the chain.  I personally don’t mind 3D movies being produced for theaters, but I think it is dumb to push the technology at the home and consumer market.  The consumer display market is still too immature to push 3D due to display size limitations.  3D on anything smaller than 100" is pointless in IMO, better to invest in OLED and higher resolutions, especially for displays smaller than 100".</p>
<p>The same people who are pushing for in home consumer 3d probably also think solar and wind farms are a good idea.  Its all too immature…for now.</p>

<p>The ps3 just got an update that implements 3D functions so that game developers can use them. As of now, no games are using them BUT Wipeout HD was demoed in 3D a few months back running on a beta copy of said firmware. I never got to experience it first hand but those that did said that “Wipeout is a game that was meet to be played in 3D.”</p>
<p>I don’t think that all games should go 3d, and I think that MOST movies should stay 2d.</p>
<p>Sadly I know that is not going to happen. Studios are making money hand over fist on 3D movies and it is fairly simple to implement crappy 3d into a game. A game should be made for 3d, not the other way around.</p>

            <p>It’s the way entertainment is heading.  The world is 3D, so more and more media will try to emulate this.  However, entertainment needs to learn not to use it as a gimmick (“hahaa, my gun is pointing through the screen.”  “hahaa, a marble just randomly bounced and is heading at your face!” “hahaa, etc.”</p>
<p>I don’t mind if video games went in the right direction in terms of 3D.</p>

            <p>@ Zeus</p>
<p>Unfortunately right now parallax technology is only really applicable to small screen size. The reason is that the field of view is very narrow, comparable to early LCD technology. Until that problem is fixed, large displays must use some external polarizing filter to achieve the 3D effect.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m pretty skeptical about the 3DS’s display. I guess I’ll have to see it to believe it.</p>

            <p>According to the 3DS info, it’s gonna have a Parallax (that it? I forget.) barrier, instead of in glasses, on the screen.  Therefore PROJECTING 3D.  I dunno if that will work, but if they did that for TVs and monitors I would definitely buy that shit.</p>

            <p>3D is just perception as is color and sound, its essentialness to enjoyable viewing film is a matter of opinion.</p>
<p>You have to understand that 3D technology is immature and imperfect, right now.  Personally, I can’t believe they are already pushing 3D TVs.  TV companies should be investing in increasing screen size and decreasing cost.  They should be investing more in OLED before pushing this 3D agenda.  Of course, I’m sure production studios are partly to blame.</p>

            <p>I was wondering the same thing when I read that…he has no idea what hes talking about lol.  Granted, the only 3D material Ive seen is Avatar, but I could easily tell the entire thing was in 3D.</p>
<p>I would imagine the opposite of what eateroftheflame is saying is true, that the cheaper CGI and horror flicks would use the occasional, gimmicky use of 3D (i.e. axe flying at your face) while half-assing the rest of the film.  Good job being an ignorant, mindless consumer whore! JK</p>
<p>Overall, right now, 3D sucks.  Id take true HD over 3D anyday.  Besides, 3D only makes sense with projectors or large computer monitors.  What are they going to make, 40-inch 3D TVs?  Even 60" is too small.  IMO, the display has to be at least 100" or in your face to <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> take advantage of 3D.  Most TVs are neither.  Now is not the time for 3D, standard consumer display size is too small and 3D tech should improve first, if possible.</p>

<p>I love Blade Runner, but why say this?  I don’t remember cheap 3D being featured in the movie.  I believe virtual reality was portrayed to exist during the time of Blade Runner; most likely 3D was ancient tech lol.</p>

            <p>I don’t think 3D will become suitable for everything until we develop a system that changes the focus plane based on your eye’s lens focus. Imagine a camera on the display that can somehow interpret the depth of focus of your eyes, then adjust the plane of focus on the 3D content dynamically. Now THAT would be sweet. And totally practical.</p>

<p>Second is that people are just now, or have just recently purchased a new flat screen TV, and a smaller percentage of that have just got a blue-ray player. Now do you expect these people to move onto a completely new technology that requires to buy a new more expensive tv and a new blue ray player?</p>

<p>Funny how much I fall into this category. I JUST bought my first plasma screen+blu-ray player+7.1 sound system to set me up a media room, and I completely agree with your point. I wouldn’t buy any new stuff that came out in the next 5 or 10 years.</p>
<p>I mean, I know technology is advancing way faster than it used to these days, and the trend is for things to be replaced faster and faster, but unlike technology, my paycheck is most likely to remain the same for the next years :3.</p>
<p>About the 3D things: in 7 or 8 years, if it didn’t require glasses and shit tons of other stuff to use, who knows?  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Well, not me. I don´t see anything special. Maybe it´s just overhyped with to few frames in 3D for me to actually notice AKA Maybe it´s just me.

            <p>My friend made me see Avatar in 3D.  I hated the movie and only saw it for the 3d effects.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was somewhat impressed with 3D but for ONE reason only.  They did an excellent job of providing depth for the 3D effect, creating what seemed to be an infinite number of visual planes negating a “card-board cutout” feel.  This is most likely attributed to the polarized lenses you are provided. Unfortunately, the 3D effect also enforces strict focus within the scene (depth of field), forcing the viewer to concentrate on <span class="bbcode-i">specific</span> visual planes within the scene, usually whatever is in the foreground or coming at you.  Regular films are generally not as rigid and one can view most of an entire shot clearly.  Also, for some reason due to the 3D effect, IMO the entire movie suffers from what seems like ghosting.  Perhaps it is something to do with the FPS of the film or after effects on the lenses, IDK.</p>
<p>Avatar in 3D is the only 3D experience I have, I have not played any 3D video games or seen other movies.  Due to the strict focus and ghosting effects I did not really enjoy 3D, at least not how the current technology is implemented in Avatar.  Right now 3D is a gimmick and I would have hated Avatar just as much (if not <span class="bbcode-i">less</span>) in 2D.</p>
<p>IMO, standardization of 3D technology would shift the production and goal of film away from art and even more towards entertainment, where Michael Bay and James Cameron reign supreme lol.  3D could provide more entertainment value for some people, but increased film immersion and usefulness as a tool for artistic expression is questionable IMO.  Story, writing, and cinematography still rule.</p>
<p>Besides, I love HD and my 60" Pioneer Kuros Plasma lol.</p>
