    <title>Two things about the &quot;sewer&quot; section of UC</title>

    <description>1. The current when the water is turned off is ridiculous and flows in one direction; there are sections which run perpendicular to the direction of the flow where a ragdoll continues dancing on the wall because the current wants to push him [i]though[/i] it.

2.  If you get caught by a barnicle when you submerge the section underwater, you will be pushed down the length of the pipe, but the game will still regard you as if you are still being drawn up by the barnicle.  As a result, even as you no longer appear to be under it, it will still damage you as if you were.</description>
