    <title>Created these horrror sounds by accident</title>

    <description>I was making a video of a couple of young Cockatiels because they were acting real excited and, in the background, our Umbrella Cockatoo and Eclectus decided to chime in too!

I was sending it to my wife and upon completion played the video only to find out that I had recorded it in slow motion by accident. The results turned out to be pretty amazing.

It sounds like a recording coming straight from the depths of hell. 

Maybe I should start recording these things more often and offer them up for usage in horror mods and videos?</description>

            <p>Yeah, that sounded diabolical and almost distressing.</p>
<p>Slowing down and/or lowering the pitch is a classic trick to make dark and ominous sounds. Another trick is to reverse the playback, for example, if it is a voice recording. Apparently, they used both these methods to create the Zombie sounds in Half-Life 2.</p>
