    <title>Game not letting me continue after dying</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/game-not-letting-me-continue-after-dying/63089</link>
    <description>Sometimes when I die in Black Mesa, the game goes black and only lets me pause and not unpause. Then it only gives me the option to quit or go back to the game. The thing is, choosing to go back does nothing. I can quit and restart the game, but when I try to start back where I left off, it just takes me back to the same blank pause screen (without the game loading beforehand like it would do normally). I can only start a new game at that point.</description>
