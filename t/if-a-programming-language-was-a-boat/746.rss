    <description>Turing

[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_01.jpg[/img]

Turing would definitely be a kayak (thank you for comments). It’s small. It’s human powered. It’s often used as a beginner “boat”. And it’s also very Canadian.


Java

[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_02.jpg[/img]

Java is a cargo ship. It’s very bulky. It’s very enterprise~y. Though it can also carry a lot of weight. Will carry a project, but not very fun to drive.


Perl

[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_03.jpg[/img]

Perl is a tugboat. Powerful enough to tug Java around, in 80 characters or less.


Ruby

[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_04.jpg[/img]

Ruby is difficult to describe. It’s sleek, sexy, and very fun to drive. Here’s a picture. Very trendy.


PHP


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_05.jpg[/img]


PHP is a bamboo raft. A series of hacks held together by string. Still keeps afloat though.


C


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_06.jpg[/img]


C is a nuclear submarine. The instructions are probably in a foreign language, but all of the hardware itself is optimized for performance.


C-sharp


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_09.jpg[/img]


Like a luxury cruiser. Sleek, good looking and quite comfy. However, not very fast , expensive and somewhat limiting.

Python


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_08.jpg[/img]


Undeniably beautiful and elegant in the water, tends to be solid and reliable. Will work with little intervention, but also provides sails to help you go that little bit faster.

HTML


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_07.jpg[/img]


HTML isn’t really a programming language boat.


Javascript


[img]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_12.jpg[/img]


Like James Bond Q Boat. It’s small but powerful and it’s really easy to get yourself killed trying to use it.

FORTRAN77


[url]https://www.candesprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/boat_10.jpg[/url]

A concrete boat that still lurkes under the surface. You wouldn’t want to set sail with it though. Try navigating around it.

There’s a lot more to the list, and it’s all up for discussion. You can read more opinions on the forum.

My big question is why PHP is a bamboo rafting, and why Rails is better that PHP.
Maybe they didn’t look at PHP5? They are many good frameworks and I really enjoy working with it.

Anyway I thinks PHP is a fishing trawler. Not fancy, not super speedy, but it does exactly what it’s supposed to do, takes a lickin, keeps on tickin. And, it’s cheap.

How would your favorite programming language fare in open waters


And someone said Visual basic was like this

<p>Or you could use a high level programming language, and get very similar results. IMO it<code>s not worth it, and I</code>ll be going on my second semester of learning it. Anything I can do with that, I can do faster with C.</p>
