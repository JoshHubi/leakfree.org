    <title>Steam Black Mesa - Gib system (Any way to toggle it on or off?)</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/steam-black-mesa-gib-system-any-way-to-toggle-it-on-or-off/13822</link>
    <description>I launched the game as soon as I finished installing it and while in options I noticed there is no Enable/Disable Creature Gib in the Black Mesa tab like it used to on the mod version of the game. Is it coming back anytime soon? A console command would also be helpful.
Another thing worth taking notice is how Auto-aim keeps getting re-enabled whenever I exit and re-enter the game.</description>
