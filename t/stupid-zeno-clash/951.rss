    <title>Stupid Zeno Clash</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/stupid-zeno-clash/951</link>
    <description>I only bought it for Gmod, and I bought it from the shops because my Steam Store wouldn&#39;t connect to the internet.

So, I&#39;ve bought and installed it, And whenever I try to run it, it opens the steam store, And it doesnt work for me. But from the link, it&#39;s obviously asking me to buy it at Steam.  :frowning: 

Any help?
Thanks..</description>
