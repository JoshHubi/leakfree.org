            <p>Some of the scanners show a fully nude image; here in the US the TSA responded to this by positioning the people monitoring the machines in a separate room away from the security checkpoints so that they don’t see the person who is being scanned (aside from the image on their screen).</p>

            <p>I think these scanners are what Airport security has needed for a long time. I didn’t agree with the full nude shots, I’m sure those could be corrupted is SOME way by someone with a creepy fetish, but these rough outlines work perfectly. I’m sure it will make more people feel safer on airplanes. (Though I’m more worried about crashing)</p>

            <p>The original line of full body scanners did in fact show the complete nude body.  The current generation of scanners (at least in the U.S.) shows a general outline of a human body which lights up to show places on the body where illegal items may be hidden.  In other words, the scanner can still see you nude, but the technician working the machine doesn’t.</p>
<p>This depends on where you go to be scanned.  I’m not sure where the new software has been implemented yet. If I understand it correctly, you also have the opportunity to be patted down instead, if you prefer to have someone grope you.</p>
