    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/civil-protection-needs-advice/622</link>
    <description>I sometimes check in on [url=&#39;https://www.civil-protection.blogspot.com/&#39;]https://www.civil-protection.blogspot.com/[/url] to see if the next Freeman&#39;s Mind or Civil Protection episode is out. Today, about ten minutes ago, Ross Scott talked about a bug he was getting in his next Civil Protection episode that he can&#39;t get over. He is having a Modeler look at it, but he put out an open invitation for advice on how to solve it. If your suggestion leads to a solution, he will put your name down in the credits as a technical advisor. Now i have no knowledge of how to solve this problem, but I figure that there might be someone here who can help him so we can all see the next episode of Civil Protection! :wink: :3 

Anyway, here is his post:

Well it looks like my tradition of discovering a completely new bug in every episode continues. Right now I&#39;ve run into a bug that&#39;s preventing me from completing a scene (read below for details). I have some ideas as to how to fix it, but it&#39;s probably going to take the help of someone else helping with modelling and it&#39;s hard to say how long that will take. The good news for you is that since I can only do so much more on the episode from my end until this is fixed, I&#39;ll go ahead and start working on the next Freeman&#39;s Mind episode while this bug gets looked into. I still have every intention of completing this CP episode, but I hate making you guys wait on more material. If all I had to do was writing, I could produce a new episode every day of FM and CP.


To those familiar with the Source engine:

The bug I&#39;m running into is &quot;Reliable Snapshot Overflow&quot; that crashes the map and occurs whenever I try to record a demo. I know what&#39;s causing it in my case. It has to do with me having a ton of small dynamic props in a small area. I could fix this problem by deleting the props, but I unfortunately need them for this scene. Right now my best theory on how to fix this is to merge many of small individual models into one larger one, so the game sees less props to process. This is probably going to be a pain to do for our modeller. If any of you know more about this than I do, feel free to post possible solutions here. If you discover one before we do and notify me, I&#39;ll put your name down in the credits of the next episode as a technical advisor.

<p>True, but I still think it’s great!<br>
I would like to see another Civil Protection though. I miss the antics of Dave and Mike.<br>
So yes, I voted Civil Protection.</p>

<p>And I challenge you to show me a “Dude with annoying voice commenting on shit he’s doing ingame” video as good as FM!</p>
<p>I love both, but I’m looking forward to another CP Episode. (I hope you all voted for getting the Next CP done. It’s already finished to 70%!)</p>

            <p>Sorry, my desktop was taken apart for a complete overhaul. I just booted up the laptop. No, I don’t want credit. I was just bringing it to everyone’s attention. I figured if there is a chance to find anyone who knows a solution, then it would be in a forum filled with Source modders and people who would know a thing or two about it. By all means if you have a solution post it on his blog’s comments, I gave a link to it in my post. I just want to see the next episode  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> .</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>He solved the problem thanks to reader advice and is opening a poll on whether he should do a CP of Freeman’s Mind episode:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Well thanks to reader advice I was able to solve the problem. I was an idiot and wasn’t using static props. In my defense, static props tend to behave much less reliably for me, plus the model has to support them in the first place, something many do not. I got lucky in this case in that the model I was using did support being a static prop. Anyway, I’m a little undecided what to do now since I was ready to switch gears. I’m putting up a new poll, I’ll go with whatever the masses decide on this.</p>

            <p>I think they’re both excellent, and I’d certainly like a new CP to come out (<span class="bbcode-i">not you, Eric Fong</span>)</p>
<p>What he’d probably need to do with his problem is Get their modeller to combine the props, like he said, and maybe decrease the size of the map to fit just that particular scene.</p>
<p>I’m more of a texture and sound guy so I may be completely off here about the map, but you never know.</p>

<p>Well if we can get someone wh knows how to solve the problem on, Ross Scott will be able to complete his next episode of CP. Until then he is going to work on Freeman’s mind. Which is cool, I like both, but I would like to see a new CP episode.</p>

            <p>I sometimes check in on <a href="https://www.civil-protection.blogspot.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.civil-protection.blogspot.com/</a> to see if the next Freeman’s Mind or Civil Protection episode is out. Today, about ten minutes ago, Ross Scott talked about a bug he was getting in his next Civil Protection episode that he can’t get over. He is having a Modeler look at it, but he put out an open invitation for advice on how to solve it. If your suggestion leads to a solution, he will put your name down in the credits as a technical advisor. Now i have no knowledge of how to solve this problem, but I figure that there might be someone here who can help him so we can all see the next episode of Civil Protection! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> :3</p>
<p>Anyway, here is his post:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">

<p>Well it looks like my tradition of discovering a completely new bug in every episode continues. Right now I’ve run into a bug that’s preventing me from completing a scene (read below for details). I have some ideas as to how to fix it, but it’s probably going to take the help of someone else helping with modelling and it’s hard to say how long that will take. The good news for you is that since I can only do so much more on the episode from my end until this is fixed, I’ll go ahead and start working on the next Freeman’s Mind episode while this bug gets looked into. I still have every intention of completing this CP episode, but I hate making you guys wait on more material. If all I had to do was writing, I could produce a new episode every day of FM and CP.</p>
<p>To those familiar with the Source engine:</p>
<p>The bug I’m running into is “Reliable Snapshot Overflow” that crashes the map and occurs whenever I try to record a demo. I know what’s causing it in my case. It has to do with me having a ton of small dynamic props in a small area. I could fix this problem by deleting the props, but I unfortunately need them for this scene. Right now my best theory on how to fix this is to merge many of small individual models into one larger one, so the game sees less props to process. This is probably going to be a pain to do for our modeller. If any of you know more about this than I do, feel free to post possible solutions here. If you discover one before we do and notify me, I’ll put your name down in the credits of the next episode as a technical advisor.</p>
