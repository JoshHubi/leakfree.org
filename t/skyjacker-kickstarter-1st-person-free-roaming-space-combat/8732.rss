Looks like it could be good - I&#39;m definitely interested in seeing how it turns out.

An early demo version is available [url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/digitilus/skyjacker/posts/221662]here[/url] (downloading this one right now).</description>

<p>Do you mean ‘skybox’ vs. volumetric? I think the point Infinity’s meant to be good is because they’ve managed to develop an engine which can handle massive spaces. That, and you’re meant to be able to travel between all of the stars in the galaxy…<br>
So I’d say it’s 3D.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I meant ‘pizzabox’ (unless skybox is another reference to what I’m talking about) which was a term they started using for space games the used a flat linear type space that resembled a pizza box (flat and squarish). Also my response was directed more at Skyjacker, though Infinity looks interesting as well.</p>

            <p>Looks pretty cool, I’ll have to keep an eye on it. Hard to tell if it’s a true 3D space combat game and not the ‘pizza’ box space that many of the space games use. I guess that’s why I liked the space game portion of SWG so much it was much closer to true 3D space.</p>

<p>‘Infinity’ is a free roaming space MMO-type game with a really interesting procedurally generating engine, which allows you to fly around entire galaxies and seamlessly fly into the atmospheres of planets.<br>

            <p>Look interesting. I can’t play much of the demo since I’m stuck with a pretty weak laptop for the summer, but what little I did get through with the lag at least showed promise with the controls and interface.</p>
<p>I’m not a big fan of the aesthetic, though. Everything is a bit too neon bright and almost cartoony for my taste, but reading their kickstarter I understand why they took that approach.</p>
<p>My biggest problem with the whole thing, though, is all of their kickstarter exclusives. There seems to be a LOT of content being made exclusive to high paying backers, and it’s not just aesthetic. Cutscenes, mission packs, alien race packs, just a lot of stuff that seems like it should be in the final product whether you were a major backer or not.</p>

            <p>Hmm…<br>
Well, I played the demo - the gameplay seems like it has the potential to be fairly good, but needs some tweaking before it really becomes fun. The combat mission included in the demo seemed a bit too easy (maybe the AI isn’t finished yet?) and the primary weapon projectiles were a bit on the slow side - I could fly almost as fast as them using the afterburner. Fighters are tricky to hit, performing evasive manoeuvres once they notice you chasing them - I mostly relied on missiles to kill them due to the slow primary projectiles.<br>
Blasting individual components off ships was neat for a bit (I cut a cargo ship in half with a cannon at one point), but the individual pieces seem a bit too fragile.</p>
<p>In some ways it feels kind of similar to the space combat in The Precursors.</p>

            <p>While I do agree that we need a good free roaming space simulator, this just isn’t the one for me.<br>
I’d like a WH:40K simulator.  Gothic War FTW!</p>
<p>Someone was attempting a mod of Homeworld2 which was set in the 40K universe, but it didn’t get far.</p>
<p>Or LucasArts need to stop butt fucking each other and bring out TIE FIGHTER 2.</p>

            <p>SKYJACKER is:</p>
<pre><code>LOTR by its gaming atmosphere of space saga
GTA by its criminal background and freedom of choice inside the game
NFS by its energy and gameplay dynamics, and ability to customize the vehicle
</code></pre>
<p>Nah skyjacker is a poor mans elite, of which there are plenty of free modern adaptations.</p>

            <p>It honestly sounds better than it looks in that video. The combat looks fairly wishy-washy and full of bright neon lights. But I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt, since I definitely agree more with the philosophy behind its creation than many other games out there. I wish them the best.</p>
