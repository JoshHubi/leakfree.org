Episode 2: Part 1 of the Half-Life fan series made by fans and funded by fans. PLEASE SHARE.

Episode One if you missed it: [url=&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GJ1CQ8A9cE&#39;]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GJ1C...[/url]

This episode picks up after the first and follows the characters as they negotiate the Hydro electric sub station on their way to the Lambda complex. 

If you like this one, Part 2 will really make you smile.

And yep, I did some voice over work for these guys too.  :wink:</description>

            <p>Man, I saw the first part of this 5 years ago… very happy it’s being continued! Makes me really wish for something like this to become official from Valve.</p>
