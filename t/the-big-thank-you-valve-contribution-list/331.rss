    <title>The Big &quot;Thank You, Valve!&quot; Contribution List</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-big-thank-you-valve-contribution-list/331</link>
    <description>[COLOR=&#39;White&#39;]-
Heya, people. This little idea was sparked through the official Team Fortress 2 forums two days ago, and has since been spread out with multiple signed names that have grown to a really big community list for Valve:

[url=https://www.skurk32.com/VALVe.htm][COLOR=&#39;RoyalBlue&#39;][b][u]Site Address: [WWW.SKURK32.COM/VALVE](https://WWW.SKURK32.COM/VALVE)[/u][/b][/url]


Basically, the goal was to show Valve Corporation how much the community loved their work after such a big period of fuss at buffing and downgrading certain classes and weapons from their recently released games, and to get people to say a simple &quot;[i][b]Thank You[/b][/i]&quot; for the Half-Life Series, Counter Strike, Day of Defeat, Left 4 Dead, and Team Fortress games. Obviously if you&#39;re not willing to thank them for anything then that&#39;s fine. You can click Back and carry on about your business. Also, I apologize if the moderators thought posting this here was a bad idea. I&#39;ll gladly remove this news if you want, I just thought to share the information here when it got my attention as it grew so big. I was wondering if it could actually expand from here.


[b][COLOR=&#39;Navy&#39;]If you are interested and want your User Name listed along with the others,
Post in this thread requesting it to be added. Use the format: +USERNAME

Example: [i][u]+Otto Grainer[/u][/i]
You may choose whatever name you like as long as it is posted by you [i][COLOR=&#39;Indigo&#39;]once[/i].
No clan or guilds names are allowed to be added, you will have to submit each
individual username instead. Also, do not forgot you can add your friend&#39;s
name, with his consent, if he does not have an account on any message board.
[/b]







When a pleasantly large number of IDs are up, it can all send over to valve. So go crazy, show your appreciation for VALVe software and their games by saying a simple &quot;[b][i]Thank You[/i][/b]&quot; [i][COLOR=&#39;DimGray&#39;](if you want)[/i]. Note I am merely spreading the word and am not the designer or manager of the site. Credit goes to the Skurk32 team with the idea submitted by Vonn64 at the official Team Fortress 2 Forum Boards:

[url=https://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=863685][COLOR=&#39;RoyalBlue&#39;][b][u]Steampowered.com/Forums/Showthread.php?t=863685 - Who wants to Thank Valve? I do[/u][/b][/url]




[b][COLOR=&#39;DarkRed&#39;]ATTENTION[/size]:[/b] Provided you have a steampowered account, visit the above thread and submit your post there instead.
For only Black Mesa users, comment with your thanks and names here and they will be collected and added to the list.
[i][COLOR=&#39;DimGray&#39;](if you&#39;re not too late and the list isn&#39;t full)[/i].</description>

            <p>…Is it really that hard to read the thread before posting?</p>
<p>Meh, just kidding. I simply wanted to brag about the fact that I made it into the list.</p>
<p>Still, maybe this should be locked or something. Dunno.</p>
