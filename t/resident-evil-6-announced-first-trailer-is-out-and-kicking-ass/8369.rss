            <p>I think horror is now better left to the indie developers. I’m kind of like a Half-Life 2 fan; never played the originals, so I have no feelings of nostalgia for the old in my love for the series, and get confused when people long for the old days. The action of shooting zombies’ knees and using all sorts of insane weaponry is what brings me there, and I don’t anticipate any Resident Evil games scaring me anymore - but to me, that’s okay.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to Operation Raccoon City, in all of it’s non-canon glory.</p>
<p>There’s no way it’ll be worse than Survivor, right?</p>
<p>…Right? :fffuuu:</p>

            <p>Necropost for Operation Raccoon City. Bunch of new trailers up and it’s due out later this month.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gametrailers.com/video/brutality-trailer-resident-evil/727271" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.gametrailers.com/video/brutality-trailer-resident-evil/727271</a></p>
<p>Surprisingly, this looks like a game I’d actually play. Capcom finally figured out that having characters that move with the grace of derailing freight trains and being unable to move while shooting was bad game design. Sure, a horror atmosphere is lost but honestly, when was the last time this series did anything better than jump scares?</p>

            <p>I’ve actually heard rumors that the dude poking himself in the neck is Hunk and Alex Wesker. (or whatever the only other remaining Wesker’s name was)</p>
<p>It’d be a crazy retcon, but actually giving Hunk a bit more story than “he always survives” would be nice.</p>
<p>I enjoyed RE5 for what it was, but as I said earlier, RE4 shattered my expectations from a main series RE game.</p>
<p>Also, I played the Revelations demo, and thought it was “meh.”  It could be because it was too short, it could be because I don’t have that dumb extra analog nub addon, it could be because it genuinely sucks.  It’ll probably end up being like the RE5 demo, the difficulty is artificially enhanced because you don’t get like 3 extra items.</p>

<p>They may combine the campaigns along with that third character from the trailer, (???) But I guess I could stand a little action and enjoy the horror parts if the story holds up. Killing Albert Wesker severely dented the story, so I don’t see who could be trying to profit from the T-Virus now…</p>
<p>Resident Evil 5 was terrible - no questions asked.</p>

</aside>
<p>I rather liked Resident Evil 5. It may not have been a good RE game, but it was certainly a pretty decent action shooter. Obviously not what a Resident Evil game should be.</p>
<p>RE6 is looking pretty sweet. I doubt they’ll bring Wesker back, but who’s to say that there aren’t any clones of him left…hmmmm? I’m actually looking forward to the branching story archs, and getting the chance to see both Chris and Leon in action .</p>

            <p>Oh shit, is that the president’s daughter showing up again ( correct me if I’m wrong)? Dat bitch better not be screaming “LEON” (or in this case “CHRIS”) every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, this does look cool, but too actiony. I don’t have too much of a problem with action style gameplay, it’s just that the market is SOOOOOOOOO saturated with it right now. I like my variety and, ever since half the big games decided to copy CoD, the gaming community has lost A LOT of it. One thing I really want to see is a good ol’ Half-Life progression of weapons system where you find weapons as you go along and keep every one that you pick up. It’s a great way to give the game a “leveling” feel without necessarily having rpg mechanics and it adds more and more to the gameplay variety as the game progresses. When’s the last time we’ve seen a game at all like that?</p>

<p>If that’s not the case, I’ll just return the game once I get it; this action direction has killed the genre and should have ended after Resident Evil 4 (which I still love, yet curse for the direction it took.)</p>
<p>Resident Evil 5 was terrible - no questions asked.</p>
<p>Edit: It was confirmed that Sherry Birkin (Finally getting back to the loose-plot-end; she has the G-Virus on her necklace…) and Ashely Graham are going to be in Resident Evil 6.</p>
