    <title>I think this would be a great addtion?</title>

    <description>I was thinking that once you download the game, that you also get the soundtrack with it. 
Who here agrees with me?</description>

            <p>It could be how Neotokyo did it- the meat of the soundtrack would ship with the mod (one disc’s worth), but you could only get the full OST if you bought the 2 disc CD. (Which I did, and it was completely worth the money. GET THAT SOUNDTRACK PRONTO)</p>
<p>It’s a good idea. Main OST with the game, B tracks, remixes, and cut tracks on disc 2 or whatever. Plus it could be formatted in a way where you could drop the OST’s tracks into BM’s music folder and it would play at parts of the game when appropriate. (e.g. each level would have ambient_generics that would play the default OST, but when you drop in the paid OST music you could get different cues that play either in the same spot or in places you didn’t get with the initial release.)</p>
<p>My God, I just developed a modding pricing model. What have I done?</p>

            <p>wait a sec! What if it is the other way around? What if <span class="bbcode-u">ram </span>knows more than <span class="bbcode-u">US</span>?</p>
<p>Regardless though… I am sure we will get the soundtrack. Before or after release is the only question eh?</p>

<p>Ding ding ding! You are correct. It has already been stated (by Joel himself actually) that in weeks before the mod is due to be released, we will get the soundtrack in its entirety.  Not sure why Ram may be denying it. Hm… something we know that he doesnt?  Astonishing?!</p>

            <p>If you’re too lazy to fish all of the files out of the mod directory, then you can bet your lazy sedentary ass that there’ll be someone else who <span class="bbcode-i">won’t</span> be.  The soundtrack won’t exactly be hard to come across, and I’d rather the devs not cram another 100+ megabytes of data into a download that already promises to be several gigabytes.</p>

            <p>I believe “Triage at Dawn” (also known as “Path of Borealis”) is NOT present in Half-Life 2 in its 7 minute entirety; there’s only like 40 second snippet after the battle after which you get the buggy.</p>

            <p>I think it was planned to be released separately in high quality, but then they changed their minds, the soundtrack included with the mod is probably high quality enough though.</p>

<p>Yes, I knew that. What I meant is that sometimes the music in the folder isn’t full. It is cut up into peices to fit with certain moments in the game or something else like that. So that’s why I said it would be great if they would include in the game download. So you can get the full tracks and all that.</p>

            <p>I was thinking that once you download the game, that you also get the soundtrack with it.<br>
Who here agrees with me?</p>
