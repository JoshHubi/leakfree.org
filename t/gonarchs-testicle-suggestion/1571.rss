    <title>Gonarch&#39;s &#39;testicle&#39; suggestion.</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/gonarchs-testicle-suggestion/1571</link>
    <description>Hello there,

I thought I&#39;d make my first post count, and suggest something. No matter how late I am into the mods completion. :awesome:

To the point:

I&#39;ve always found the Gonarch a very hard enemy to take seriously, with that massive testicle dangling around; giving birth without warning. I&#39;m sure this is how VALVe originally intended for the Gonarch to be portrayed, but I comtemplated the idea of something a little more &#39;awesome&#39; (without drastically changing the silhouette).

I envision something resembling a blastocyst (early foundations for embrygenesis in mammals), hovering between the Gonarch, and the ground. 

[url=&#39;https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v668/maryscottoconnor/MLW%20Pics/BLASTOCYST.gif&#39;]https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v668/maryscottoconnor/MLW%20Pics/BLASTOCYST.gif[/url] An image for reference.

It&#39;d make perfect sense for the Gonarch to have a setup like this, as it&#39;s primary function appeared to be pro-creation.

As well as this, it would add considerably to the general horror of the fight, in that your perception of fear isn&#39;t ruined by the fact that there&#39;s a massive testicle dancing about (although, some may find ball-thrusting scary, as it is  :wink: ).

I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s physically impossible for something non-human either. 
Par example: The Nihilanth&#39;s head opened up. This isn&#39;t physically possible to do with the mere strength of muscles in your own cranium.

Just my two cents.

P.S. If I&#39;ve made any mistakes: spelling or otherwise, do tell me.</description>

            <p>Wow, things have changed since waaaaaaaaay back in the 90’s when I was 16…  We didn’t talk to each other about our ballhair, or lack thereof.  I was too busy smoking weed, shoplifting cheap beer from convenience stores, and trying to nail 17 year old chicks.  In fact, I do believe I would have kicked one of my friends’ asses for trying to tell me about his hairless sack.</p>
<p>That reminds me, Gonarch: Source needs a nice set of curlies to go with that seam and wrinkle texture.</p>
