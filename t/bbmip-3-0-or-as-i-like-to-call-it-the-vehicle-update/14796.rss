    <title>BBMIP 3.0 or as I like to call it the vehicle update</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/bbmip-3-0-or-as-i-like-to-call-it-the-vehicle-update/14796</link>
    <description>I have been slowly replacing old models, and slipped in the crown vic in the last CU, but the real big one is this one. Couple of years ago before I really started to model a lot I got Robert to make a new jeep. This was before the steam release and with all the replacement I ended up doing, I didn&#39;t have the time or experience compiling to really do it justice. Well while working on the STU stuff I made the trucks and a lot of the skybox props and ended up fixing up a lot of the old source game models so they all matched the style of the CSGO ones (i.e. very dark interiors,little detail and very dirty windows).  These include the big gray van and the little utility truck. Those were released with the last CU.  I had been using the parking lot in QE for my testing and noticed some things that really didn&#39;t fit in with the rest of the updates I was doing.
For instance. Hummer didn&#39;t have a dedicated interior. This was something I left out when I redid those models a couple of years ago, at the time it was detail you probably couldn&#39;t see but ended up sticking out with all the changes and the new CSM.

So I did a quick interior and fixed up the smoothing groups. Originally I did the remakes from a very old model we had from 2006 but I hadn&#39;t been compiling my own models. This is the final result. Makes a big difference when you see the before and after IMO.

M35 already had a decent darker interior so that didn&#39;t need any changes, but the windows were different so redid those.

So where is the Joop you ask? Good question!
When I posted my WIPs in the dev forum it started out with just me doing it for practice. The biggest hurdle was the number of replacement models it was going to require. There was a clean/dity one, open door shot up one (with 2 textures) crashed one and a burnt one. Luckily 3 of the 4 were already done. it just required lots of textures and planning. When Robert made the original model he got burned out making it (its a very nice model) and I volunteered to do the interior to help out. Since then we changed the look of the vehicles (see above). This actually (for once) worked out better for me because I had UV&#39;d the model interior with the idea that it would be fully textured at a high resolution because this is pretty much the signature vehicle for us. So to help make all the vehicles blend I used the wheels from the CSGO models you see in STU. What I ended up with is this. Note these are mostly the WIP images from 2 months ago and they get better as they go. Please DO NOT CC THEM.
Base model texture with temp windows and temp normal/spec renders in toolbag2. The original model had solid top lights and front lights (this was to help with the alpha sorting issue the staggered single lights had on Adam&#39;s Joop). After playing a ton of the division when it released I liked the effect they did with their vehicles. So I had to change things around so that there was glass/plastic overs over all the front and top lights. When I opened that up (with it being transparent) I needed some detail so I added spinners (not working) and other lights to the top set.

The cool thing was Robert had made it modular for a civilian version with shared UVs so you now get a 4 fer.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/gP72GzZ.jpg[/img]
The problem I ran into was one of the versions needed to have blood all over because it was all shot up. I compromised and made the interior dark gray and light gray 2 toned so it would show up.
[img]https://i.imgur.com/RNxk6aO.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/MdqUxE1.jpg[/img]
So the fun began. I made a really high resolution bullet hole texture and then ended up trying 3 different sizes keeping in mind I was going to shrink the texture when I got done (its 2k in game but 4k in renders) but I wanted them to be readable not blobs. That carried over to the windshield. The texture was small in comparison and if were resized would look terrible. So I compromised and made the texture bigger (only 1024) but modeled in the holes into the window.
At this point I had most of the stuff done, but still needed to have a wrecked one. Since I was still working on all the different textures Robert was nice enough to model it with engine details which you may or may not be able to see in that shot. Believe me its all there and looks very cool. Also at this point the modeled front lights are showing up and they are broken with separate broken glass. The normal maps are getting closer to final here. Also note the collapsed airbag..... I had to model that in there its my favorite part.

So we end up with this.

Well how does it match up in game? Glad you asked!

These are all from my test area plus one from LB. Please do not comment on the sorting problems with the windows there is nothing I can do but make it worse (trust me I have tried lots of things)

[img]https://i.imgur.com/vKn9Gat.jpg[/img]
Well you are probably thinking he forgot the damn burned up one......
[img]https://i.imgur.com/Qi8KMHl.jpg[/img]
Heavily influenced by the division in the way they did burned out detail. The seats are burned away so are the tires. But after looking at this for several days and going through lots of references I didn&#39;t like how I picked the seats and tires to burn out but not the plastic bumper cover and wheel well splash guards and the dash etc. So back to the modeling board.......oh and I had that groovy engine......
[img]https://i.imgur.com/qkZeTcA.jpg[/img]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/C265hnO.jpg[/img]
SO I&#39;m completely worn out. That was basically about 90 hours worth of work but it was fun trying new things. Textures will probably still get tweaked but it&#39;s mostly finished. Is it perfect not close, but I think it&#39;s an improvement from what we had before and matches nicely with the rest of the vehicles. Now as for that ugly red truck.......

Oh forgot to mention who was responsible for what. Robert did the base models as mentioned I did all changes and interior models and the burnt model. All textures by me and the burnt substance was by Bard our mad (one of 2) texture geniuses.
Happy Memorial Day!</description>

<p>You aren’t supposed to see his interior since he does appear only in scenes where you are far enough of seeing his inside part,however I do agree about the pilots and his outside part a bit undetailed compared to the new security jeeps.They can’t help OBM team since it will cause a lot of copyright problems which may be caused but that decision,also they can look at the original Opposing Force design and other military games if they need it.</p>

<p>I don’t know much about them,I thought there are only one team and from what I heard, they had a lot of copyright problems in the past with their maps judging by the comments in their topic on this forum.So we can’t take their work seriously because I saw on their Moddb page some maps like Communication Detour and they seriously wanted to implement them into the storyline and some maps that were created by russian mapper.</p>

<p>Yeah that’s was old images and stolen images i noticed that… that images was uploaded by TheNatureGamer… our old mod leader. Now leaved it… he was stoling the images from other mods. Now i’m the mod leader and trying gather somethings. I need much things… and much helps.</p>
<p>“wanted to implement them into the storyline and some maps that were created by russian mapper.”</p>
<p>No we don’t want and we didn’t implement them. We made the part where is the broken pipes in Welcome To Black Mesa Chapter. Now we don’t stoling the images and contents from other mods and trying not stole.</p>

            <p>It has to be the latter, since I can see the side windows when I move around the joop and it has collision. I suppose this was just one of the rare instances where the old glass model was actually used and it didn’t get noticed when the new models were put in.</p>

            <p>Hmmm. Looking at the picture, since I’m not at home to check, it just looks like you are seeing weird artifacts from CSM or there could be an old windshield model from the old joop I can’t tell.</p>

            <p>Looking quite good! I like the little details such as the embossed Joop logo on the steering wheels.</p>
<p>I know this is more of a level design issue, but I figured I should bring it up while I’m on the topic - in bm_c2a4h the crashed joop by the door has a misaligned duplicate/obsolete window model sticking out of it:</p>

<p>The updated model itself looks awesome wrapped around the pole like that, though.<br>

<p>Forgot to answer this one. There are 2 ways to do vehicles in source. You can have a vehicle with the material properties of metal or metalvehicle and it will just show up as metal bullet holes when shot. For the windows to show up with broken glass details when shot you have to compile the glass separately and place it as a separate model. Our old joop was like that, that is why there wasn’t any glass in them the LDs didn’t place them. The other was is how I did it, all compiled together and the bullet holes show as metal hits on the glass. Unless someone knows a work around that is the limitations as far as I know.</p>

            <p>Wonderful. These really put the old models to shame (no offense to the person who made the originals, and who’s probably much better at it now anyway xP). Can’t wait to see them ingame  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Forgot to answer this one. There are 2 ways to do vehicles in source. You can have a vehicle with the material properties of metal or metalvehicle and it will just show up as metal bullet holes when shot. For the windows to show up with broken glass details when shot you have to compile the glass separately and place it as a separate model. Our old joop was like that, that is why there wasn’t any glass in them the LDs didn’t place them. The other was is how I did it, all compiled together and the bullet holes show as metal hits on the glass. Unless someone knows a work around that is the limitations as far as I know.</p>

            <p>On the work around for windows, I know at least one source modder that put invisible windows in front of glass sections on vehicles, though that might not work as the decals where floating.</p>

            <p>I’m just going to temp ban derailers, it’s  very annoying. This is why I don’t  want everyone giving their opinions on what they didn’t like it just ends up being off topic really fast,<br>
Look up any police, sherriff or security vehicle there are multiple fonts. You are free to mod it youself if you want later.<br>
As far as reference I usually pick a model of whatever vehicle or prop from the real world and make it pretty close within reason. For other props they are an amalgamation or multiple references unless there is something specific a LD asks for.</p>

<p>btw, when facelifting models, do you prefer to ground it towards real life more or making it as good as possible without worrying about how its based non-fiction-wise?</p>

This whole discussion has been derailment after derailment, in fact. Stick to the topic, which is specifically - Brian’s redos of the vehicle models.</p>
