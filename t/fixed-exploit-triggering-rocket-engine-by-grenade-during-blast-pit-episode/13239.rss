    <title>[FIXED] Exploit: Triggering rocket engine by grenade during Blast Pit episode</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/fixed-exploit-triggering-rocket-engine-by-grenade-during-blast-pit-episode/13239</link>
    <description>Hey there. Just accidentally thrown grenade in the control room during blast pit episode, and it triggered the launch. Not sure if it would happen if i hadn&#39;t fuel and electricity turned on, as it happened on my way up. Anyway I wasn&#39;t even killed during the cutscene, so it is pretty much worth exploiting  :slight_smile:</description>
