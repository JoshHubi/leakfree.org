    <title>Creating SWEPs and playermodels for gmod</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/creating-sweps-and-playermodels-for-gmod/5852</link>
    <description>I have a tiny question since I have searched thick and through.  I have no idea how to rig animations and other files for making SWEPs in gmod, I also need to rig playermodels to the skeletal system and animation, but I am unable to find a suitable tutorial to do so.

How may I go about doing this?  I&#39;m trying to make Neotokyo SWEPs and playermodels for gmod.  After that, I was thinking of doing the thermo-optic as an addon.</description>
