    <description>I finally decided to buy HL2 : DM as I assumed I could run various mods using it.

I&#39;m pretty sure I have to edit something in the mods gameinfo.txt file, but what is it?</description>

<p>You shouldn’t have to edit anything; all mods use the SDK base and then pull their content from other GCF files (other games) as necessary…if you’re editing the appIDs then you’re going to have problems, either running the base game or getting the mod to work. Just put your mods in the SourceMods folder, reboot Steam, and play.</p>

<p>Thanks. This worked.</p>

<p>Yeah I bought it. What IDs would I need to put?</p>

            <p>Different source mods require different source games installed.<br>
Research and Development requires ep2<br>
Minerva requires ep1<br>
etc.</p>
<p>Those requiring HL2 can be run using HL2demo (appID 219 iirc)</p>
<p>I don’t have the SDK base installed and R&amp;D runs just fine.</p>
<p>If anybody knows how to get a mod to work using a different source game than it requires, please share.</p>

            <p>Are you sure? I’ve seen around that BMS will run having only HLDM installed so I thought all mods would be the same?</p>
<p>EDIT: I’ve been googling around a little and was just wondering if this would work.</p>
<p>If I edited my gameinfo.txt file to</p>
<pre><code>	SteamAppId				320
	ToolsAppId				218
</code></pre>
<p>320 being HL2DM ID and 218 being Soruce SDK Base 2007 ID, would it work? I’d test it myself however I havn’t got SDK Base 2007 installed. I’ll have to install that tonight during my off-peak data time period.</p>

            <p>You can get skins and all that cool stuff, but I think you need to get a legitimate game if you want to play actual mods.</p>
<p>With HL2DM you can get Gmod.</p>
