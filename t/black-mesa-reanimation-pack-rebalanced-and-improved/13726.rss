    <title>Black Mesa Reanimation Pack : Rebalanced and Improved</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/black-mesa-reanimation-pack-rebalanced-and-improved/13726</link>
    <description>So, I was really in love with [url=&#39;https://blackmesa.gamebanana.com/skins/126786&#39;]iipon&#39;s animation pack[/url], but I felt that the balance of the weapons was a bit off compared to to originals, and that some of the sounds felt like they were going to blow my eardrums out. I started making some adjustments to the weapons for private use, and have decided to post them here.

The improvements are fairly subtle by nature, but the glock has been altered to fire as fast as the mod one does, the shotgun&#39;s reload time has been sped WAY up (seriously, it was slow as a snail), the rpg&#39;s refire time has been decreased as much as possible, and the 357&#39;s refire time has been decreased.

            <p>I’m not exactly able to tell the difference for most of it, but I appreciate the better reload time on the shotgun.</p>
<p>Actually, I think the reason the pistol fired slower initially though, was because faster looks jerkier.</p>
