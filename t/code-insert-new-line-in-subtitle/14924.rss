    <title>[Code] Insert new line in subtitle ?</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/code-insert-new-line-in-subtitle/14924</link>
    <description>Hello there!
I have done translating the game to Arabic language for a along time. Sadly the game doesn&#39;t support Arabic from right to left. But that&#39;s okay, there is some method I can do to make it work. To let this method work, I need to know what is the code I should write/use in subtitle file, to make insert new line in the game. Without it is quite impossible to make Arabic language work in long sentences. That&#39;s why I need to make them short sentences.

I really need your help  :slight_smile: 

Thanks!</description>

<p>Hi there, thanks for reaching out. I unfortunately don’t know of any code that makes a line break in the close caption code.<br>
I have also checked <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Closed_Captions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the Valve developer wiki</a>, and found nothing.</p>
<p>I know translations take a lot of work, so I am really sorry for this inconvenience. It just doesn’t look like there is anything that we can do about it at this point.</p>
