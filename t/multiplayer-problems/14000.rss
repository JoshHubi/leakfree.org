    <description>Content Downloading:

1. When connecting to a server hosting custom content no indication is made that the content is downloading.
2. Multiplayer custom content is placed into the single player campaign directory instead of a download folder, making it harder to purge.

Missing Features:

1. Decals don&#39;t appear to be supported at all as impulse 201 does nothing, but import is still possible
2. Voice chat doesn&#39;t seem to be supported at all in this release.</description>
