    <title>The Comeback Of Cartridges</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/the-comeback-of-cartridges/6241</link>
    <description>So I was think about it today, and currently to play games on game consoles we have discs. Mainly DVD disc on the Wii, which can hold about 4.7 GB if its not dual layer. On the Xbox We have Dual Layer DVD discs which can hold about 8.5-8.7 GB, And BLU-Ray which can hold anywhere from around 17GB to about 30GB. Now with that being said, how much can flash memory hold? depending on the flash memory, it can hold anywhere from 1Byte to 1TB. But say we made a flash memory cartridge that could be used in the Wii. The manufacturing cost of one DVD disc is about $0.49 Cents per disc (according to Wikipedia) The manufacturing cost of a flash memory cartridge the same size (in memory) is only about $0.27 Cents (according to Wikipedia). So flash memory is cheaper to manufacture than discs. But it not much cheaper only about 20 Cents cheaper. But that adds up. Game companies produce millions of copies of there games. That 20 cents will add up. So with flash memory becoming so dominant in todays storage devices. Do you think we will start seeing game console with cartridge come back?</description>

            <p>Well, you could do what I believe the DSi does, and just have games on SD cards. Someone’s already suggested that. As flash memory gets bigger and bigger, it’ll be easier to put games on it until you can eventually put RAGE onto one uncompressed. In time, it may be a viable replacement for the Blu-Ray/DVD, but as of now, it’s not very practical.</p>

<p>Awesome game!</p>
<p>Also, flash memory is deleted if left without power for a long time; it’s not permanent. Get a DVD (or rocket knight adventures) out the loft after 10 years and it works as good as new</p>

<p>Ah, yes! The Genesis was awesome. I still have mine- It’s older than me and it still works. It’s practically the AK of the 4th Gen consoles. I’ve still got 20+ games for it on my bookshelf with my other games, and I still hook it up once in a while and play Rocket Knight Adventures and other such classics.</p>
<p>One of these days I need to get around to playing Phantasy Star II to it’s conclusion, but the damn game is ball-bustingly hard.</p>

            <p>Cartridges are useless except for the joy of looking at them. I have 3 computers for the reason of saftey and losing info. One computer has online out of the three. I keep all my online games on it and some single player games along with music. On my second computer I keep a back up of everything on thier including online website URLs and passwords - offline and unplugged until use for saftey. My third computer has all my single player game backed up and a lot of private work - plugged in but offline.<br>
My online pc has a nice firewall with addware protection, avast, and 4 more custom made things to keep me protected.</p>
<p>Thing is, I have to put one thing on a computer, and then put it on the other two. It’s a pain in the ass, but I never get worried about losing stuff or getting a virus. All I have to do is take the internet out of the main one, then put it in the second one and it’s like nothing every happened. During that time of leasure, I fix my broken one. I’m ideal, ^^</p>

<p>Garth, you make good points there, but for the love of fuck, take your console hating attitude out of here. I’m not trying to convince you to like consoles, it’s just that everytime you say “console fags” or make subtle or not-so-subtle jabs at consoles, it basically diminishes whatever good points you make in your opinions.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I refer to just about any electronic related fanboyism as fag. I call my self a pc fag. I call others mac fags. It’s not so much console hate as it is making fun of fanboys in general including myself.</p>

            <p>If everything in gaming goes digital, I will quit gaming. I cannot watch and see what could happen to my potental future games being lined to death with DRM and at the mercy of being erased with no way to get them back also what happens if the authorization servers go down? Its a disaster waiting to happen and i darn well hope consumers will experience that. Then they’ll see.</p>

            <p>Concerning the OP, the cost of flash memory is one thing, but packaging that thing in plastic (or whatever) is another.<br>
However, the cost of flash memory probably drops much faster, since it’s in constant evolution, whereas discs just evolve generation by generation (cd -&gt; dvd -&gt; dvd dual layer -&gt; blu-ray). So in the long-term, I guess it would make sense.</p>
<p>Plus: much faster and no moving parts -&gt; less crap breaking.</p>

<p>Then in the future people will forget how to binary and base their religion on the random patterns.</p>

            <p>The electro magnetic holocaust will destroy all physical media. It doesn’t matter whether we own hard copies of things or it’s all stored on a server. We’re all fucked if it happens regardless.</p>
<p>And Sega Channel was damned awesome. Sega were always ahead of their time.</p>

            <p>The Sega Genesis had downloadable games over something called the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Channel" data-bbcode="true">Sega Channel</a>”.  It was a cartridge you stuck in your Genesis that had a cable jack on it.</p>
<p>And this was in 1994.</p>
<p>Consoles are great for what they are.  I’m not going to diss 'em.   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: The Sega Channel wasn’t technically “downloadable” games.  It was more like streaming games.  The game would exist in the “cartridge” adapter until you reset the system or shut off the console, then you’d have to stream again.</p>

            <p>Not at all. He just has an annoying tendency to bring console hate even when it’s not justified to do so. It distracts from whatever good points he might make and paints him in a bad light.</p>
