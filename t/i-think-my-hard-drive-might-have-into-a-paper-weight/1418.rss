    <title>I think my hard drive might have into a paper weight</title>

    <description>Sorry for the massive wall of text, but if anyone takes the time to read through all of this and help me it would be very very much appreciated whether or not you can actually help me.

Alright, so, I just got a g11 logitech keyboard and installed it and it&#39;s macro key programming driver. It was amazing, the key were perfect and the backlighting is stunning. Anyway, I was playing Rainbow Six Vegas 2, a game I have never had any problems or crashing with whatsoever,  when I came to a loading scene. at first i noticed that the loading scene was taking a little longer than usual, then it completely froze. I alt+ctrl+deleted and let it sit for a while and nothing happened so I hit the power switch. Then, on rebooting my computer it said &quot;error loading cd, press alt+ctrl+delete to restart, so I did. then it made it to the windows xp splash screen. It was taking a while so I took a dump and came back and it was still at the splash screen, so I rebooted again in safe mode this time and it ran a diagnostic listing a ton of .sys files. then it stopped and said &quot;hit esc to cancel loading ****.sys and froze there. Rebooted again. messed with bios and boot menu. Kept rebooting, but every time I got one of the above results. I even put in my xp disk and ran system repair, it froze at checking zero bytes of zero bytes. Kept rebooting and fiddling with setting over and over and getting nowhere, then I noticed that my hard drive stopped showing up in the boot menu. I then attempted to install windows xp, it gave me an error saying I didn&#39;t have a hard drive. So that is where I am at right now. Also, the keyboard works fine and I have been using it for bios and boot menu. Also something I should mention is I never restarted my computer after installing the keyboard drivers as it never asked me too, so when it crashed playing Rainbow Six was the first time I had booted the computer after installing the drivers.

EDIT: lol, I did it again, I always look through my posts to check for typos but I never remember to look at the title:retard:</description>

            <p>Go visit <a href="https://www.grc.com/cs/prepurch.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.grc.com/</a>, buy SpinRite (yes it’s definitely worth it if you have data on that drive that you need), put it onto a CD or floppy (from any other PC), and boot it on the problem PC and let it do it’s thing.<br>
Most likely you’ll get everything back and can continue just fine, tho I might recommend getting a new HDD anyway.  Worst case, it’ll be able to fix enough to get you your data just before the drive dies completely.</p>
<p>This program has been around about as long as HDDs have, so it’s the best there is.</p>
