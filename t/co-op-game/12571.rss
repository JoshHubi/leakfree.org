    <title>CO-OP Game</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/co-op-game/12571</link>
    <description>If there is already a thread on this, I did not see it,, sorry.
This would be an ideal game for some great co-op matches,there are very few games out there now with good coop play, also thinking of the older generation players out there who cant handle a game that has no end of keys to play the game, keep the controls simple. some large scale maps to hunt down the bad guys and take them out. Also have an editor so that players can make maps at home,and then a site for others to download them.
Thanks for reading this.</description>

            <p>Not sure if any of u played Sven co-op but it’s pretty much a big team co-op game (up to like 7 players). Sven Source would be awesome!</p>
<p>You’d play small campaign maps like L4D. It was pretty fun! (but then again, everything was since I was just a little kid)</p>

<p>That’s the original Half-Life: Decay for PS2.<br>
There’s actually a Half-Life mod for PC that lets you play it online, as well.</p>
<p>That being said, I’d really like to see a Black Mesa version of Decay… Maybe I’ll try it if I ever get the time… not that I know how to map or anything. LOL</p>

            <p>I wonder if he was remaking Decay, or something original. I’d be kind of neat if it was an original story alternate-view style like Decay, Blue Shift, or Opposing Force.</p>
<p>I kinda hope someone re-makes Decay for BM also, though.</p>

<p>The Devs have said on the Wiki that there will not bean official Co-Op campaign. However, there’s nothing stopping another team from making one using BM’s assets, to my knowledge.</p>
