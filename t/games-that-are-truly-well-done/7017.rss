<p>What makes it shine is that you can get some traces of Ukrainian here and there. Yeah, they speak Russian, but there is an occasional word of Ukrainian origin slipping through from time to time. Especially with bandits (bandits use a lot characteristic thieves’ jargon in their speech, btw). And the accent is generally quite ukranian (except from high ranked NPCs), too.Very authentic, considering…</p>

<p>I like the odd Russian phrases in the Stalker games that have no translations. I was kind of sad that there wasn’t as much Russian thrown in in CoP as compared to SoC.</p>

<p>I find the russian accents hilarious so its a worthwhile compromise. Also it annoys me in SoC when they try to give game relevant information in Russian, and I end up having no idea whats going on. It certainly is a flawed masterpiece.</p>

            <p>Majority of Ukrainian population speaks or at least knows Russian. The languages are nearly identical, though Ukrainian is funny as hell to anyone who speaks Russian.</p>

            <p>That’s cool. I at first thought they were speaking Ukrainian until I heard otherwise because it takes place in the Ukraine and is made by a Ukrainian company.</p>

            <p>What makes it shine is that you can get some traces of Ukrainian here and there. Yeah, they speak Russian, but there is an occasional word of Ukrainian origin slipping through from time to time. Especially with bandits (bandits use a lot characteristic thieves’ jargon in their speech, btw). And the accent is generally quite ukranian (except from high ranked NPCs), too.Very authentic, considering…</p>

<p>Like we have no idea what all the NPCs say to eachother round campfires etc.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do. It’s usually anecdotes and general reflections/bitching about life in the zone. What makes it even more brilliant is that the anecdotes can be both funny and not funny.</p>

<p>Anyone here play stalker without the Complete mods? I got CoP a while back, but only just started to play it because the complete mod was released. They’re essential imho</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You can live without them, but you’re better off with them. I’ve finished my first SHOC playthrough without it.<br>
I had my own quirks with the mod itself, like disabling head-bobbing and no npc weapon tossing upon death.<br>
Had to manually enable them back. Other than that and the fact that my lappy likes to slowdown at times (on max settings sans MSAA) in CS, the mod is damn good.</p>

<p>Pssh who wants to play Clear Sky.</p>

<p>Me. I’m about to enter red forest.<br>
It also strikes me how much more ruble I spend in CS compared to SHoC.<br>
I used to accumulate more than 400k in SHoC. In CS, I spend tonnes on upgrades and ammo.</p>

            <p>I wouldn’t say they’re essential, really. I have a lot of fun without them, but they definitely improve the experience for me.</p>
