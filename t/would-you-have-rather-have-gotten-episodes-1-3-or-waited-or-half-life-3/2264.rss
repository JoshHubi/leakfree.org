            <p>Gotta pick the episodes.</p>
<p>Valve wow’d us with Half Life 1, which was a near impossible game to top and re-revolutionize, yet they did it again in Half Life 2. I say they can do it again once Half Life 3 is ready.</p>

            <p>Episodes, I felt like half-life 2 wasn’t about finished when I made it to the explosion at the end, hence the episode needed.</p>
<p>For half-life 3 I want to see a new engine and a whole new game.<br>
But of course in the same mood.</p>

            <p>I played HL2 and Episodes 1 and 2 in one continuous go because I was late so I can’t relate to having to wait for them. Just looking at how the final games turned out, Episodes 1 and 2, I’d say it worked out good. Have to wait for Episode 3 to be sure.</p>

            <p>While I usually prefer my games in one piece so that I can play through them without having to wait months/years for the next part, I have to admit that the graphical improvements introduced in each episode are in part because of the episodic format.</p>

            <p>Somehow, I think Gordon’s gonna die. I think the G-man detained Adrien Shepherd, from Half Life: Opposing Force, as a backup plan in case his main employee, Gordon, dosn’t make it, since Gordon and Adrien were the only ones able to capture the interest of the G-man during Black Mesa.</p>
<p>If that’s what it takes for Adrien to come back, i really don’t mind, it’d definatly make the story more realistic and not portray Gordon Freeman as superman so much.</p>

<p>Which was sorta my point. Even when Gabe says it’s HL3, I’ll still listen to Doug and Robin who actually write the games and work on the games, whilst Gabe pretty much only handles PR work now.</p>

            <p>I think we can say that Half-Life 2’s episodes are Half-Life 3.<br>
But it’s hard to really tell. Since they only chose Half-Life 2 instead of 3 to avoid confusion.<br>
I would think it more likely that they call the next actual installement of the Half-Life series Half-Life 3, then 4. Even if the episodes are in reality Half-Life 3.<br>
It would be even more confusing to go from 1, to 2, to 4 after all.</p>
<p>So I’d say they’d do it like so:<br>
Half-Life, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2 Episode 1,2,3 (factually Half-Life 3), Half-Life 3 (Factually Half-Life 4)<br>
But that’s just how I see it.</p>
<p>Gabe does quite literraly call the Episodes Half-Life 3 in the interview:<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“If you think of Half-Life 1 as the G-Man trying to turn you into something that was useful to him - the transformation of the player into hero. And then Half-Life 2 was about how he was using you. Half-Life 3 [a.k.a. Episodes One to Three] is about the relationship with the G-Man and what happens when he loses control of you, when you’re not available to him as a tool and how he responds to that, and what are the consequences of that.”</span></p>
<p>So as they called the episodes Half-Life 2 to avoid confusion, they’ll call Half-Life 4 Half-Life 3 for the same goal.</p>

            <p>While Half-Life ended in a cliff-hanger of sorts, it was the kind that is acceptable as an ending.</p>
<p>I suppose that is how Ep3 will end.</p>

            <p>I get the impression that releasing episodes is giving them a (slightly) more stable revenue stream than having one big release for 4 years of development. I wonder if we would have had all of Portal, L4D and the amazing TF2 updates if they didn’t do episodes?</p>

<p>That’s all fine and dandy, but this one states otherwise:</p>

<p>Also, that was a highly butchered summary by IGN of a Eurogamer interview.</p>
<p>From IGN:<br>
“Throughout the interview, Newell refers to the episodes as Half-Life 3, and points out that they aren’t considered expansions.”</p>
<p>If you read the actual Eurogamer interview, that is completely untrue. Read the quotes IGN made and you’ll see that they not only quoted what Gabe and Erik said wrong at different points, but also conveniently left out vital information.</p>
<p>Newell stated that the episodes are the third PART of the half life saga and not the third GAME in the saga. He regrets calling the episodes “Aftermath” and stated that a better name would have been Half-Life 3 Ep1, 2, 3 etc. because he felt “Aftermath” was confusing. Following that observation, they chose to use the HL2 name instead.</p>

<p>Probably a better name for it would have been Half Life 3: Episode One, but these three [episodes] are what we’re doing as our way of taking the next step forward, but Half-Life 2 was the name we used.</p>
