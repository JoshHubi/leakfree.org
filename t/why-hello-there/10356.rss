    <title>Why hello there...</title>
    <link>https://leakfree.org/t/why-hello-there/10356</link>
    <description>Hey guys, Carlos told me to swing by and post to complete the circle.

Before anything else, [b]a huge congratulations to Carlos and the team[/b].  Having seen Black Mesa grow over the years and finally released, it&#39;s hard to believe a small community map project on LeakFree.org almost nine years ago would grow into a huge mod soon to be put onto the STEAM distribution platform.  Black Mesa is an amazing piece of work that is beyond anything I had foreseen for the mod: all due to the hard work of the developers that stuck through everything and came out the other side.

Once again, congratulations to the team for the awesome video game that immortalizes Half-Life on the source engine.

Now, back to being an oil tycoon...</description>
