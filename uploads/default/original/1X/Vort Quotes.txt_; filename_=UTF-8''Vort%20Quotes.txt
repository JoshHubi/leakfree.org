	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_01"	"Is it the Freeman? "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_02"	"Comes a man? It is! The Freeman! "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_03"	"We remember the Freeman. We are coterminous. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_04"	"There is no distance between us. No false veil of time or space may intervene. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_05"	"We see you still in Black Mesa. Clearly we see you in the Nihilanth's chamber. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_06"	"We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nihilanth's demise. You leap, you fall, we see you flash beyond the barriers. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_07"	"For a brief time you joined with us. You are one. Between the worlds. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_08"	"Communion of the vortessence. And that other: a deeper mystery. No deeper than the void itself. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_09"	"We cannot forget those whose cords you cut. Forgiveness is not ours to bestow. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_10"	"Unity of purpose, the shattering of common shackles, a single road we tread. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_11"	"Your song we sing and shall sing for eternity. No matter the consequences of this struggle. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_12"	"You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond measure. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_13"	"We are there still, in observance of your final stroke. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_14"	"While our own lay scattered at your feet, you severed the vortal cord that bound the Nihilanth to life, and to us. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_15"	"That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day. For once the lesser master lay defeated, we knew the greater must also fall in time. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_16"	"With you beside us, a talisman of victory, the day of freedom draws nigh. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_17"	"Your bright face obscures your darker mask. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_18"	"We call you sib, although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_19"	"Far distant eyes look out through yours. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_20"	"Something secret steers us both. We shall not name it. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_21"	"We have endured these chafing bonds for eons, yet a single moment of further servitude seems intolerable! "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_22"	"How often have we slipped our yoke, only to find it choking us again. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_23"	"Let this war end in either total victory or our extinction. No further compromise shall we allow. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_24"	"We take our stand beside you, here, upon this miserable rock. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_25"	"The way ahead is dark for the moment. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_26"	"What seems to you a sacrifice is merely, to us, an oscillation. We do not fear the interval of darkness. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_27"	"We are a tapestry woven of vortessence. It is the same for you if only you would see it. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_28"	"How many are there in you? Whose hopes and dreams do you encompass? "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_29"	"Could you but see the eyes inside your own, the minds in your mind, you would see how much we share. "
	"npc_vortigaunt.vmono_30"	"We are you, Freeman. And you are us. "
