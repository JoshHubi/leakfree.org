          <title>Can you make it so the flashlight doesn&#39;t come out of my dick?</title>

            <p>Hey guys, thank you all for the brilliant game.</p>
<p>So yeah, as the title says, I feel like the flashlight is positioned way too low. When using it in an open room or hallway it works fine, but as soon as you move close to a waist-high crate the room is plunged into darkness as the crate casts a shadow over everything on the screen. All you need to do is walk up to a wall with the flashlight on to see that it’s literally positioned directly on Gordon’s crotch.</p>
<p>Particularly annoying is crawling through vents and having every dead heacrab you kill cast a shadow up from <em>the floor</em> over the entire screen until you move past it. Not to mention trying to look through glass panels on doors or windows into darkened rooms only to have to the wall below the window light up while the area beyond becomes even darker. Really kills the survival/exploration vibe, man.</p>
<p>I was honestly surprised that I couldn’t find anyone else mentioning it. I’ve tried clean installations on two completely different PCs and the behavior is the same. Seems like a pretty simple fix and I hope you guys will consider it for a future update.</p>
<p>Thanks again for everything.</p>

          <title>How did Black Mesa react to the BYDTWD incident at Aperture Science?</title>

            <p>As far as i am aware the Black Mesa incident happened after the BYDTWD. I’ve been wondering for quite some time now how Black Mesa reacted to that incident. Obviously they were competitors so it wouldn’t have been that off for Kleiner to make a comment about it at the Borealis debate in Half Life 2 Episode 2.<br>
Due to the lack of acknowledgement of the incident from Black Mesas side I am wondering wehter the BYDTWD incident is actually known in the Half Life universe.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?<br>
Also why didn’t the combine try to get into Aperture Science?</p>

          <title>Thanks for the best game experience I&#39;ve had in 20 years</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[danbaker]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>To Adam Engels and the entire team at Crowbar Collective, along with all the contributors over the last 14 years -</p>
<p><strong>I just want to say thank you for the best gaming experience I have had in 20 years</strong>. In reinventing a classic you have in fact created another classic. Black Mesa is mesmerizingly good; a stunning tribute to the original and all great games.</p>
<p>I know you have received thousands of reviews, but I don’t care about them. I simply want to take the time to write to you, share a few thoughts, and let you know that the years of hard work you have invested in this project have paid off. You nailed it. You absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>I grew up in the era of the classics: Wolfenstein 3d, Quake, Doom, Resident Evil. I first played Half Life when it was released at the impressionable age of 16 and, like everyone, I was blown away. Since that dawn of the FPS period I’ve watched the game industry boom while the quality of (most) games seem to diminish. In a parallel to the movie industry, quality titles are rare to find; either lost in the noise or replaced by the AAA design-by-committee bullsh*t that either rushes a game out before it is ready, or butchers original ideas into unrecognisable artistic failures.</p>
<p>Disappointing is the word I would use to describe so many games I have played over the last 15-20 years. Perhaps it’s me and I’m just getting older, I often wonder. Or I’m too hard to please. I’ve basically given up on mainstream games these days.</p>
<p>But as I played through Black Mesa, savouring it over 24 hours of play time or so, I was reminded again of what an unforgettable game experience feels like. The dark and mysterious plot; the slow paced exploration phases punctuated by intense action; the creative impressions of science fiction technology; the combat engine; the amazing atmospheric music and sounds; and the gorgeous art, creature and level design. I found myself literally breathless taking in some of the scenes, often using the shotgun to dust away enemies like a pleasant housekeeping chore, so I could get a better view. The subterranean nuclear reactor in lambda facility; the underwater cave on Xen and Xen itself. Outstanding.</p>
<p>Of course it depends on the person, genre and style, but the backbone of every great game is, without question, the storyline. It’s the key to the deeply immersive and memorable experience that many players seek. All the best literary art and media share this trait. And this is what Valve unquestionably nailed with half life (and indeed Capcom with Resident Evil). No matter how good your combat engine is, or how sexed up your textures are, the game is hollow without a twisting, powerful plot. Sure many games are a lot of fun without a serious storyline but they are never ‘great’ without this foundation. Upon reflection, I’m sure this is due to the inevitable growth in popularity of multiplayer style games which sacrifice the storytelling power of linear narrative for the freedom of open world playability and oversimplified micro quests.</p>
<p>I think of the half-life games as a subgenre themselves; they pioneered it. A first person shooter, science fiction, linear storyline, horror/gore/action/thriller, with a brilliantly dark and mysterious plot. Brutal yet beautiful. Paced in a way that allows long periods of exploration, mystery and realisation as the plot slowly unravels, before the mood is broken by hardcore action and combat scenes.</p>
<p>What I think is missing and unconsciously craved in the gaming community is a decent half-life subgenre-esque, cooperative FPS. A terrifying slow burning thriller that captivates players with the depth of the single player narrative, but does so with up to 6 players cooperatively. I’m not talking a fighter-console-warrier like Halo, I’m talking something deep, something akin to the Aliens brand. Implied terror. Mystery. Tension. Atmosphere. Horror. Then carnage. And I don’t mean Aliens: Colonial Marines (2013), but some of the thinking behind the base storyline of this game is on point. Sadly this game was shamefully ruined by lack of artistic vision, once again. In fact the one thing they managed to achieve was the corporate desecration of one of the most exquisite concepts in science fiction history. If the team at Crowbar could reinvent something like Aliens: Colonial Marines as a cooperative atmospheric thriller, mark my words I would be as frenzied as a fanboy on crack at an E3 showcase. As a fan, I really feel that this is the gap in the market, and I think you guys are the team to fill it. I believe this because all of you evidently love this genre just as much as me and you’ve spent the time recreating what you love.</p>
<p>I acknowledge you’re adding the co-op Beta to Black Mesa which looks awesome but note this is a mod, an afterthought that will never quite captivate the audience in the way a ground-up co-op build could. (i.e. there is only one developed character Gordon Freeman woven into the central narrative, etc.)</p>
<p>I know it’s really hard to do, and probably won’t make as much money as a cookie cutter mainstream game, but I believe people want to play cooperative FPS storylines, particularly on PC. The Left For Dead series is a brilliant example of co-op success, with the absolute loosest of storylines. Zombies. Guns. I’ve searched for good PC co-op FPS for years, and am still falling back to Left For Dead 2 which is now a decade old. I know there is Borderlands but this series is fun, not scary, and the plot is not that engaging for me. Friends love fighting their way through a campaign together. Why has a brilliant and scary FPS cooperative game not been made? If it has, please tell me.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what the next project is for Crowbar Collective, but if you are basking in the success of a job well done and soul searching for new ideas, I’d like to make an impassioned plea to explore the idea of a 1-6 player FPS cooperative thriller. A truly terrifying ordeal that fills players with cold dread as they unravel a sinister plot and come to terms with the scale of their predicament. This is the dream I’ve been imagining for years.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you once again for reminding me why I love video games. To you and all those who worked on the Black Mesa project over the last 14 years: <em>STANDING OVATION</em> I know nothing is perfect, but you should be so proud. 10/10.</strong></p>

          <title>An overhead map of Xen</title>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m here today to present to you some new overhead maps! This release features the entirety of Xen, Gonarch’s Lair, and Interloper. Here they are:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed" title=""><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed_2_350x500.png" alt="" data-base62-sha1="vWaxJo3mkTA89Hz7FIOWxfMzXE9" width="350" height="500" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed_2_350x500.png, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed_2_525x750.png 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/dfd6bc3978254b1487c8f081dbff0b256823e5ed_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">561×800 169 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>

<p>These have been a long time coming. I should note that Xen is separated from Gonarch’s Lair / Interloper as they are not physically connect; <em>however</em>, it is possible to calculate an exact displacement between the two areas (if one were to look at the skyboxes), which I have not done.</p>
<p>I’ve also created a zip file that contains higher-definition versions of these maps as well as overhead maps for each and every map of the game. It is here:<br>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gybj91i8y4lahln/Black%20Mesa%20Overhead.zip?dl=1" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/gybj91i8y4lahln/Black%20Mesa%20Overhead.zip?dl=1</a></p>
<p>I will note upfront that the individual maps are oriented as they are in-game. For composite maps, Overhead C (which is the Xen area) has been rotated 90 degrees so that it faces its true orientation. Likewise, the tip of Nihilanth’s tower has been rotated with respect to how it is mapped in the game so that it too faces its actual direction.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just want to start by saying the game is fantastic.  I have already given it good reviews elsewhere on steam and other places.  I would give it a 9 of 10.  Here I am going to post the reason it is not a 10 of 10 game, and I feel it could easily be.</p>
<p>Two major issues and missed opportunity.</p>
<p>-Sound effects-  I just realized something walking into a room of head crabs scurrying around. There was a major missed opportunity with this game. It was pretty scary walking through that door and seeing those headcrabs jump out. But I realized something was missing. It would be so much more terrifying if I could NOT see them, but I could HEAR the soft shuffling of the headcrabs around me when there close. It would need to be subtle and very faint, but it would be scary and panic inducing.</p>
<p>In fact that is my biggest complaint about the game. The alien calls and soldiers shouts are all fantastic, but the sound of enemy movement in this game is basically non existent. There is no background music, so like Dark Souls, take advantage of that fact!</p>
<p>-hard difficulty-  Hard mode is not hard at all in this game. And it is not because the ai is bad at all. It is very good in fact. It is because you have a ridiculously high amount of health with a full health and a full shield. Enemies die realistically but you do not. That design philosophy is fine, Gordan freeman is a badass and that should be so. But it needs to be balanced around that fact. They can literally double the amount of enemies and it would still be playable. Now I am not saying to do that for every encounter, I think the military fights are actually mostly fine, though a few more Marines in a squad in hard mode would be nice, headcrabs, zombies, basically all alien encounters are a mediocre challenge at best. Now of course we don’t want to turn this into a different type of game so I am not saying put enemies everywhere. In fact, keep them where they are. Just adjust those encounters and tweak them a bit to increase the challenge.</p>
<p>My suggestions</p>
<p>-More teleporting in of enemies during the encounters when they already teleport in. Have a second or third or fourth wave come in much more often for the Zorg and Agrunts and headcrabs. I can end most encounters with the at 75 % health or better. Keep em coming. Also, have some enemies teleport in behind you. It makes no sense that they just teleport in directly in front of the player in his line of sight.</p>
<p>-Zombies. Zombies are no threat at all and only require a crowbar. The entire facility was just taken over by aliens. People would group up in clusters. I shouldn’t be fighting one lone zombie over and over after maybe the initial reveal. They should be in groups of four or more and they should be accompanied by head crabs because that is how they turned. Perhaps add a non shuffling zombie variant that moves a bit more quickly.  For example, it makes sense that the scientists are slow, they are out of shape and the zombie should reflect that.  However the security zombie, and especially the marine should be faster to reflect the physical shape of the body that was taken over.</p>
<p>-head crabs. They are also no threat. They can jump across the screen so fast but they move around as slow as a turtle? Give them actual walking and turning speed please. They are the size of a small dog or cat with long legs so they should be able to move faster.</p>
<p>-Those alien spit enemies ai could use a tweak as well. I can attack them from far a way and they seem to not respond at all. They have a long range attack have them chase after and move more to get into firing range during a long range battle.  Make the behavior more aggressive and give them a buff to movement speed as well, leave there turning speed slow but give them a fast bull charge ability.</p>
<p>-The AI for the marines is very good. They flank you, the move around very quickly and the advance on you like real marines would. They need no change.</p>
<p>Most of the other enemies are pretty good for the most part balance wise, just like I said have them cluster in larger groups together. It makes sense from a lore perspective as well. The game is fantastic though even if I feel it is very easy.</p>

In game’s menu always shows Xen image instead of the image of the chapter I am playing.<br>
Isn’t it suppose to show the image of the chapter that I am playing?<br>
As you can see on the screenshot I posted I am playing POWER UP chapter, but the image is showing Xen chapter.<br>
I tried deleting black mesa folder and redownloading the entire game from steam, but it did not help.<br>
Any ideas how to fix this?<br>
Thanks in advance!</p>

          <title>Updated VMF Release?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sb7766]]></dc:creator>
          <category>The Cafeteria</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Way back when, the VMF files for the maps were available on the public beta branch of the game, and were invaluable in kicking off the Pre-Disaster mapping projects. Decompiling is the only option at the moment, and I fear that this will result in some information being lost during decompilation. My hope is that now that the game has hit a 1.0 release, that these VMF files can be released again for mappers to use. They would certainly be useful to me for a revival of my PD Lambda Core, and for reference if perhaps Xen sections are to be added to the project. Do the devs plan on releasing these VMFs any time soon?</p>

            <p>Hello everybody !<br>
Hope you all doing well in those apocalyptic times. <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/black_heart.png?v=9" title=":black_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":black_heart:"></p>
<p>Is there a way to disable or tone down the NPC constantly reminding to reload ?</p>
<p>I hate my habit of abusive reload and I actively restrain myself of doing it after a few shots. So the constant reminder of the npc drives me mad. Especially when I have still 2/3 of a full mag. And how even can they know if I wasn’t around them when I took the shots… It just break the immersion for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this is not currently achievable in game could anyone so kindly make a mod for it ? It would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I wish you a lovely week-end.</p>

          <title>Monorail visual rework in 1.5?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Is the monorail tram going to receive any additional visual reworks in 1.5? I always though that while the model shows a lot of work it never made a lot of sense and its textures feel too handcrafted and complex (too grainy).</p>
<p><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d1a6d9418dd3809463ee34489c89c924c22b1661.jpeg" alt="ppt-on-monorail-technology-22-638" data-base62-sha1="tUFgiFD53fPPfwwmw7jN54vc665" width="638" height="359"></p>
<p>Takig a look to that photo reference the textures could be a lot simplier and make better use of phong materials (flooring doesn’t have any crevices and the same goes to walls), seats are simplier an usually aren’t individually separated (less polygons).</p>

            <p>I had no Idea where to post this, hopefully it fits around here.</p>
<p>I really liked how the Gluon Gun was used in the later sections of Xen but i couldn’t help but notice a missed opportunity for when the Gluon gets supercharged.</p>
<p>As you know the Gluon Gun has a display monitoring its status. So, wouldn’t it be cool if the screen’s readings changed as the gun becomes engulfed by green crystal energy?</p>
<p>It’s a relatively small detail, but I believe it would greatly increase immersion while making it easier to understand what is happening to the gun.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

            <p>I think the title is fairly self-explanatory.</p>
<p>I was at work. We had a publication deadline for a paper on December 10th (which later got extended to December 15th… <em>after</em> we busted our humps trying to meet the original one) and had none of our results ready, so my colleague Orhan and I trucked over to the concrete basement that serves as our lab around 6 PM and spent about two hours coding a simulation that would test our vision software. Then we had it run a bunch of different scenarios automatically, log the results, and then dumped them into a spreadsheet and stuck the resulting graph in our paper. We were there until 4 AM, and while the simulation was running I played through all the way from the “Soon™” map in Interloper up to the end of the game.</p>

            <p>So i just saw some videos on Youtube of Nihilanth battle and i have noticed that he doesn’t Teleport the player. Will y’all be adding that into the game in a later update? If so might i suggest that you add his Teleports to the Hardest Difficulty and remove the ammo stashes from his main chamber and add those ammo stashes to the places he Teleports you to. Giving us players who like a challenge a bigger challenge.</p>

            <p>It’s been years since I tried BM. With the impending Xen release I decided to hop in and see what the game’s like today, and I was blinded by the light.<br>

These are the examples of what I’m talking about: the top one is a clipboard under a ceiling lamp, the bottom one is the same clipboard in a slightly less illuminated corner. Stuff is just too bright and reflective. I tried to tweak all in-game settings available but none of them changed this. Is that how the entire game is?</p>

            <p>I don’t mean to offend anybody, but further down the road, is the team planning on a console release? I know there would need to be a lot of optimization and control reworks, so I’m not asking if there will be an immediate console release after Xen is done. I’m just curious as to if it’s something the team is potentially considering maybe a year from now, once the PC version has been fully completed/optimized/bug fixed. I think it could allow for a larger audience to experience half-life for the first time; for $20, its a great game, and could potentially do much better on console marketplaces than just Steam alone, especially if it releases on next gen consoles when they launch. Sorry again if this offends anyone on the dev team.</p>

            <p>About 3 years ago, I posted a topic asking you guys when the Xen maps will be complete. While that time it offended you and I meant no offense by that. After realizing Xen maps are released. I just came here to Thank all the game developers to finish one of the best games ever! Thumbs up!</p>

            <p>The Tentacles don’t feel as good in Black Mesa as were did in the original because they don’t make any sounds. (And I mean the creatures themselves, not the clonking and drumming they do.)</p>
<p>This is how they sounded:</p>

<p>Why in Black Mesa don’t they even make any noise during the death animation?</p>
<p>I’d really like to see the sounds added before the full official release!</p>
