When I turned my computer on, and launched the game I was greeted to this. I have no idea what caused this, I hope a solution can be found. My graphics drivers are up to date, and I can provide hardware specifications if needed. (I’m not English)</p>

            <p>even “funnier” when i teleport into the room, my characters is constantly spinning around even though the platform is not moving. when i try to go into the nearest teleport ball i do not go up to the higher level platforms.</p>
<p>this picture is from a video walkthrough i was using to figure out what was wrong. i am not having any luck actually taking a real in game screenshot right now.</p>

          <title>BM does not start on Ubuntu 20.04 - missing libs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dino]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>After upgrading to Kubuntu to 20.04 and BM to latest stable version as of now (unfortunately I upgraded both at the same time) BM does not start from Steam UI at all, and from bm.sh reports missing libraries. After manually installing some libraries, game progressed to main menu but still crashed on loading “new game”.<br>
BM is supposed to contain all libraries it needs, (since it is 32 bit, and mostly run on 64 bin Linux) and so far mostly did (except old problems with libstdc++.so.6)<br>
Following libs are missing:</p>
<p>libopenal1<br>
libsndio7.0<br>
libasound2<br>
libtier0.so<br>
libfontconfig.so.1<br>
libfreetype.so.6<br>
… and many more. Root supplied libraries with missing dependencies seem to be engine.so and vguimatsurface.so</p>
<p>CC, kindly fix it as a critical issue as that looks like is affecting everyone on Ubuntu 20.04 (these libs do not come preinstalled in 32 bit versions anymore?)</p>
<p>Typical message reporting missing lib:<br>

<p>I keep losing patience downloading these libs manually, which seems to be your job, right?</p>

          <title>ED_Alloc: no free edicts ... Catastrophic Game Crashing Continues</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Catsmack]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The “ED_Alloc: no free edicts” bug continues to crash many PC user’s game after over a year since the game was released.  ALL solutions recommended are not working.  Solutions include, loading a previous save, restarting the level, entering command codes at the developer’s console. None work … not just for me either, but based on the messages left on the Steam discussion board.</p>
<p>On the Steam Black Mesa Discussion Board under the “Bugs” thread, one of the moderators said that the problem was a logic flaw in the source code which caused too many instances of “Edicts” to be allocated which overloaded the game and caused the crash.  The error was not related to the computer the game was installed on.</p>
<p>It was also suggested by a board moderator that there might be an update (version 1.5) which would fix the problem.  When the question of a projected date for the release was asked, the moderator replied “when it is released.”</p>
<p>Question:  When will version 1.5 Black Mesa be released? Is there a better answer, one that is more informative, than “when it is released?”</p>
<p>Thank you in advance / with great respect,<br>
Catsmack</p>

            <p>Hellow, i’m new to this forum, and i’d like to report a problem: I have Black Mesa 1.0 and I’ve installed the We-ve got hostiles pre-disaster map  (version 0.2) but every time I lanch the map, the game closes directly, I’ve tried a complete check of the local files, but it doesn’t work, I find that regretable, because I really wanted to visit this place before disaster. Well, I hope someone will read me and help me solve the problem (This is a message from an English-French translator, so sorry for the many mistakes if any)</p>

            <p>Game worked like a charm until the boss fight in surface tension. From then on all my save points, both autosave and manual ones, won’t load. It starts loading then crashes. Everytime. I tried restarting game, PC, ran on potato graphic settings. Validated game files in steam. None helped. My specs are more than enough to run this game on highest quality.</p>
<p>I am not willing to restart the whole chapter anew, no time.</p>
<p>Pls kindly help.</p>

          <title>Massive Bug/Glitch Report</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[neon5916]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello dear developers! Below I will present you a lot of bugs and flaws to fix.</p>
<p>My system requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit (Service Pack 1)</li>
<li>AMD A10-6700 APU with Radeon HD Graphics 3.7 GHz</li>
<li>RAM: 4 GB</li>
<li>GPU: ASUS GeForce GTX 750</li>
<li>Version of game: 1.0, the last public beta</li>
</ul>
<p>Common bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Russian translation of the game is terrible, you need to make a translation from the Steam community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you enable/disable V-Sync during the game, the flashlight stops working. After loading everything is ok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Earth levels, when switching to another map, they write landing jets, and this is a feature of Xen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the new menu, weapons don’t get dirty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Aid kits are transferred between cards, but then the character can’t use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some barnacles don’t have their tongues hanging out. Also the tongues of dead barnacles can twitch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NPC`s on the stairs move with jerky animation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the hat is spawn and given the appropriate priorities, it can’t be picked up after saving/loading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not break the mugs and some monitors. This was most likely done for performance reasons?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes soldiers or the vortigaunts can not see the player, although it is close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you pull out the stand on which they are located from under some TVs, the TV will hang in the air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very difficult to carry objects on hanging ladders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the chapter Residue Processing, for some reason, the factory and waste water doors were replaced with static ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you run with a pizza, it can fall out of your hands when you throw it forward and then pick it up.<br>
It’s very annoying when someone chases you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Xen, some surfaces have a gloss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Xen, many places don’t have collisions for items and so they can get lost in textures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Xen, in some places, the sound of the portal does not work, or it is somehow muted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Xen no snarks nests to be picked up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add the energy of running and flashlight in some places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add the corpses of office workers in Office Complex, not just doctors and security guards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add the corpses of workers in On a Rail, not just doctors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add a Vent mod in chapter We`ve Got Hostiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add On a Rail Uncut and Loop mod.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add Hazard Course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add Uplink mod in Forget About Freeman chapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to add a survival mode to the game on the Xen map after the player rejects G-Man’s offer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anomalous Materials</p>
<p>map bm_c1a0b</p>
<ul>
<li>In the test chamber near the power button of the spectrometer the image on the monitor is bifurcated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unforseen Consequences</p>
<p>map bm_c1a1c</p>
<ul>
<li>In the place, where the zombie climbs out of the hatch, if you squeeze and throw the hat through the door on the other side,<br>
then after a sortie from this hatch, the hat can not be picked up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Office Complex</p>
<p>map bm_c1a2c</p>
<ul>
<li>In the refrigerator, you can move the bridge on which you need to go further into the wall.</li>
<li>At the end invisible vortigonts may appear near the elevator and then stand and talk.</li>
<li>The achievement “Our Brains And Your Brawn” doesn’t work correctly - when everyone is gathered and the enemies are killed,<br>
the achievement may not count. To do this, you need to load the last save from the menu, quick save does not achieve.</li>

          <title>Interloper - Player trapped if plugs used out of order or plug dropped</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[WFGTurtle]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I found a couple of bugs in Interloper that I couldn’t see previously reported. They occur after you are sucked through a vent into a 2-level room containing Vortigaunts on the lower level, a lift at the left-hand end of the room, and a spinny thing at the right-hand end of the room (bad description I know, I’ve attached a screenshot of getpos and status - couldn’t figure out how to copy the info to the clipboard.)</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57" title="black%20mesa%20bug"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57_2_690x188.png" alt="black%20mesa%20bug" data-base62-sha1="r2agfTS73E5eNBWZWT8I0Y2q8Tl" width="690" height="188" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57_2_690x188.png, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57.png 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/bd795d140c2407974427e42a266364e812366f57_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">black%20mesa%20bug</span><span class="informations">857×234 58.2 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>The first bug causes the player to get trapped if they unplug the plugs in the wrong order, and can be reproduced by the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the room, and take the lift to the right into the underfloor vents. Reconnect the plugs down here as usual, then continue up the lift into the rotating machine at the other end of the room.</li>
<li>Instead of unplugging the plug in the rotating machine, leave it plugged in.</li>
<li>The lift at the other end of the room does not move, meaning the player can be trapped on the lower floor if they fall down.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second bug causes one of the plugs to become unreachable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug the plug inside the rotating machine.</li>
<li>Accidentally drop it down the edge of said rotating machine. It hangs down into the lower level of the machine and cannot be brought back up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both bugs trap the player in the room, making it impossible to continue without reloading an earlier save or using console commands. There’s an autosave at the beginning of the room, so it’s unlikely to present a major problem to most players, but I figured I’d report it anyway (I was dumb enough to stumble into both of them by accident, so I guess others might be as well).</p>
<p>Both bugs are demonstrated in the linked video: <a href="https://youtu.be/l6Trthms58k" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/l6Trthms58k</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this is of use.</p>

          <title>[Linux] Game Crashes after altering graphical settings</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ThothXV]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m running on Arch Linux, and have an AMD Radeon 5600XT. Whenever I try to alter the graphical settings in any way, the game crashes soon after I hit “apply”.</p>
<p>I have been unable to find any textual game logs, and I do not know where they are. Running the game from the command line also proved unsuccessful. As such, I can’t provide those logs for you. However, I was able to get a coredump. The issue is a segfault somewhere in the UI code, and that’s really about all I can say because I don’t know anything else.</p>
<p>Minidump isn’t a thing on Linux, so I can’t give you one. I <em>can</em>, however, give you my coredump. Presumably, you have a copy of the executable with debugging symbols, which would render it useful. You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U-qRQ4sUR0C3NYePG-RP6D0a4CEZypB9" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>I am aware that my system configuration is unsupported, and that you don’t have any obligation to help me. I understand if you can’t resolve the issue, but am appreciative of any help you can give me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! Great game, thank you very much! Enjoyed every level, and all of them were working just fine UNTIL the very fight with Nihilanth. I was about to finish him off when the game decided to “NOPE” me and crashed. I tried again several times and the issue was still there. That just couldn’t be more frustrating!

          <title>Game will not run since update</title>

            <p>Obviously there was a recent update with the release of the Xen level.  Ever since then the game will not run.  Before that not only would it run but it would do so at close to 120 fps.  I opened a support ticket and was told that my hardware cannot run the newer version and the solution is to roll back the update.  Of course this would mean no Xen level.  This game was sold/purchased stating that Xen would be included but never said it would break the game.  I requested a refund via Steam but was denied because of their 2 week refund policy.  I refuse to pay several hundred dollars to play a game that cost me $10.  This was not because my hardware changed but because the software was.</p>

          <title>Vortigaunt brave/scared AI can make goofy decisions</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[UncarvedWood]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>From patch 1.0: <em>Vorts AI now behave differently depending on how brave or scared they are feeling, which is based on damage taken / done to the enemy.</em></p>
<p>This is really cool, and watching the vorts run away is great and really makes them feel like real characters in a world instead of enemies to be killed - but if the player is very close, a low morale will have the vort ponderously turn about and turn their very vulnerable back to the player in which time I have already blasted them. This makes them feel a little goofy, ineffectual, and it breaks the immersion because it feels “off”, something only a weird video game AI would do, since in a real combat situation the last thing you would do is slowly turn around and show your back to the enemy.</p>
<p>Short of implementing a much faster “turn on your heels and run away” animation, I feel that in order to reflect a real “fight/flight” situation, the scared AI should run away UNLESS the player is very close by, in which case they should fight desperately, either closing in for melee or instantly using the “dispel” attack. This would make them feel more formidable and less awkward.</p>
<p>Really minor, but just something I found quite noticeable and immersion-breaking on my last playthrough.</p>

          <title>Vortigaunts dodge in response to player even when they are in combat with others</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[UncarvedWood]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So vortigaunts now dodge in response to the player aiming over them, a feature from the Xen update pasted onto all vortigaunts in the Black Mesa facility. However, these vortigaunts are also often in combat with HECU.</p>
<p>In Surface Tension, there are some massive fights in which the player can even choose not to participate. In those fights, I can be far away from the action, probably not even visible to a combatant, but still the vortigaunts dodge in response to MY aim even though they don’t even acknowledge my presence, instead of in response to the HECU units they’re fighting.</p>
<p>This is a minor bug and hardly noticeable, but because I had read the patch notes I could not stop noticing it.</p>

          <title>Two bugs in Lambda Complex tunnel to pump 2: weird guard and disappearing scientist corpse</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[UncarvedWood]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello, just two bugs I noticed in the Lambda Complex tunnel to the reactor coolant pump 02. Nothing game breaking.</p>
<p>The guard who lets you in can follow you but would be (I assume) eventually blocked by the debris. However this guard bumps into an invisible obstacle and stops following you way before that, before you even turn the corner and see the debris.</p>
<p>On that debris is the corpse of a scientist; however, once the next map loads of the actual pump and resevoir, this scientist is gone. This is especially noticeable on the return to the reactor hub, as the player faces the scientist popping in before and after loading.</p>

          <title>Gonarch Bug with Satchel Bombs</title>

          <category>In-game Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In Gonarch’s Lair, I came up with the clever idea to spread out a series of satchel bombs in hopes of chain- detonating them later after Gonarch made his appearance.</p>
<p>Pleased with my idea, I planted one satchel without detonating it.  I planted another.  I planted a third.  I attempted to plant a fourth but the game froze completely.  I had to do a hard kill of the game (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) and restart the game.  I repeated the strategy and got another hard freeze.  This happened 3 times in different places of Gonarch’s Lair.  I have never had any problems up until this point</p>
<p>I have given up on this strategy but I wanted to report the bug.  The game is otherwise  terrific.</p>
<p>I have a PC gaming machine, MSI Ace motherboard, 2080 Super game card, 32 gigs ram, AMD Ryzen 3900x.</p>

            <p>I started playing again with the Steam release and could have sworn the Health charger had a little shutter that went down when empty. The HEV also used to close up when empty but that doesn’t happen either.<br>
The other animations appear to work.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue?<br>
I’m on Steam and no mods that would affect that.</p>

            <p>Basically, you know that after the big elevator with the headcrabs falling on you, there is a security guard on a bridge fighting some creatures, one of them a houndog (or whatever it’s name is) and it blows up some explosive crates, which blows up the bridge and kills the guard, and Gordon then needs to jump on some pipes to make it across. Well, if you kill the houndog, the bridge won’t explode, and the guard won’t die. But there will be an invisible wall that won’t let you cross the bridge, which I think is really inmersion breaking, as the bridge is clear and walkable, and forces you to take the pipe anyways. I can’t upload the screenshot but you can try it for yourself.</p>

          <title>Game-breaking misbehavior in chapter &quot;On A Rail&quot; on Linux Mint 19.2</title>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>WONDERFUL game! I can’t wait to continue it</p>
<p>I’m having a weird set of issues starting on bm_c2a2b, starting at around -150.7, -896.7, 200.0. As I said in the title, I am on Linux Mint 19.2 x64. What seems to happen is that all keyboard and mouse button control doesn’t work, nor do normal xorg escapes like alt+tab, alt+`, ctrl+q, or anything like that. I have to go into TTY1 to actually exit the game. However, the mouse movement still works. This starts when I go back next to the weapons locker, reload the shotgun, or something like that.</p>
<p>I sometimes regain control after taking some damage, but I haven’t seen any consistent behavior.</p>

<p>I’m experiencing  crashes in XEN as well, but this time it occurs on this bridge when game reloads (after I fall off the bridge. Strangely after i killed myself using weapons It did not crash and falling off bridge after that did not crash the game)<br>
