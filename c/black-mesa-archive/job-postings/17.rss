            <p>Crowbar Collective is looking for a NEW voice for Dr. Eli Vance!</p>
<p>We are looking for an actor that can impersonate <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0347039/?ref_=nv_sr_1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Guillaume</a>, the voice of Dr. Eli Vance in Half-Life 2 and Episode 1 &amp; 2.</p>
<p>The ideal applicant will provide dry recordings from a dead room. I know that sounds gross, so let me clarify.</p>
<p>A dry recording is a recording with no added effects. We are more interested in your performance than your audio mixing skills.<br>
A dead room is a quiet, echo-free recording space. No reverb, street sounds, roommates, hisses or hums in the background.</p>
<p>We’re also looking for somebody with access to quality recording equipment, and the ability to record while on Skype for voice direction.</p>
<p>We hope this opportunity will bring in a lot of talented actors, so please understand that we will not be able to respond to every application. We’ll let you know when we want to hear more.</p>
<p>We’d also like to know which voice the community prefers.<br>
Once you’re done, feel free to share the audition with your fellow interwebbers!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="hashtag">#blackmesavoice</span> <span class="hashtag">#neweli</span> <span class="hashtag">#crowbarcollective</span></span></p>
<p>If you don’t think you have the pipes/gear for the job, then please help point any qualified voice actors towards this jobs posting.</p>
<p>Email <a href="mailto:jobs@blackmesasource.com" data-bbcode="true">jobs@blackmesasource.com</a> with an outline of the equipment you used during recording, your availability, the files/links of your Black Mesa recordings, and, if available, files/links for any past voice acting work.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Eli: “Unforeseen consequences.” The last time I heard those words was back at Black Mesa. You had just stepped into the test chamber, when he whispered them in my ear. You know who I’m talking about – our mutual friend. When he brought in that crystal, I knew I, I should have aborted that damned test. But, I didn’t. The whole world went to hell that day. And now, now he’s using my little girl, putting words in her mouth. God damn it. I should have known when he rescued her it was for his own damn reasons. Gordon, there’s so much I need to tell you.</p>
