            <p>I would like to first apologize for the downtime during the forum migration. This was no easy task and I am excited to finally be here with you all.</p>
<p>Due to our previous software bottleneck, our quick solution to stop the influx of spam was to temporarily disabled user registration. Sadly, this solution turned permanent; stopping community growth as a result. This is why I am happy to introduce to you our new digs and welcome all newcomers as user registration is finally re-enabled.</p>
<p>With our new forum software being open source, it comes with a slew of amazing things such as powerful spam protection tools, community moderation, and more.</p>
<p>I have migrated everything from our previous forums database with the <strong>exception of avatars and user passwords.</strong></p>
<p>In order to retrieve your account, please reset your password and be sure to <strong>check your spam folder</strong>. If you are having any troubles, please send an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:webmaster@blackmesagame.com">webmaster@blackmesagame.com</a>. and I’ll get you back up and running in no time.</p>
<p>I also executed scripts to help format posts but it’s not always perfect. If you have a post that looks a tad malformed, be sure to beautify it. I’ll actively be doing so as well. Also don’t forget to re-upload your avatar.</p>
<p>Please use this topic to provide any feedback or suggestions. This may be the beginning, but I will be actively working on this iteration in terms of features and aesthetics. Help make it the best that it can be.</p>

            <p>Hey Community,</p>
<p>I know there has been a bunch of things occurring recently that’s preventing this community from growing, such as the looming forum software bugs and lack of spam prevention tools. This has not fallen on deaf ears. I cannot share much, but the evolution of both the website and forums are well underway. Please bare with us a bit longer! I promise salvation awaits.</p>
<p>To all the lurkers, registration will be re-enabled when the evolution goes live.</p>
<p>PS. A new Wiki is underway too.</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br>
Josh.</p>

            <p>So on the front page of the website there’s a link that’s supposed to send you to a compiled .zip containing the entire soundtrack, but the link itself seems to be broken. I’m not sure if this is broken or I’m overlooking something, but either way it’s a shame that I can’t seem to download it.</p>

            <p>I’m posting this thread as there has been no official word on whether a responsible site admin has been notified of the current spam attack, which is quickly spiraling out of control. Right now, there are eight spam accounts at work, and the number of concurrent spam accounts appears to be steadily increasing. The only currently active mod ( <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/User/237-TheeGoatPig/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">@TheeGoatPig</a> ) is clearly getting overwhelmed by the sheer amount of spam and he has reported that he is having trouble deleting the spam threads because of forum error messages.</p>

<p>The following problems must be related to the error messages he’s getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several threads in the Website Issues subforum have lost all their posts and show up as having -1 replies in the thread index.</li>

<a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/12518-The-Unofficial-Official-Chat-Thread/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Unofficial Official Chat Thread</a> seems to have lost 87 pages’ worth of posts. EDIT: It appears that it’s the first 87 pages that’s been lost. When you open the thread, you see 702 pages, but in the thread index it’s still listed as having 788 pages.<br>
(As a side effect, my like count has dropped by one as I had a post with a like in one of the affected threads. I DEMAND COMPENSATION! /jk  <img src="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/wcf/images/smilies/tongue.png" alt="" width="" height=""> )[/size]</li>
</ul>
<p>A site admin should address this issue ASAP, before too much damage is done to the forum.</p>

          <title>SPAM has gotten rediculous</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There has been A LOT of spam lately. Specifically with the advent of the new website.</p>
<p>I propose that ALL newly registered accounts be limited to ONE post for a period of 36 hours and to only make newly registered accounts aware of that rule AFTER they have submitted their first post. (Obviously, moderators should be allowed to bypass that restriction once it’s verified that it’s legitimate.}  This way, if it’s spam, there will only be one occurrence of the garbage prior to them being banned.  Hopefully, when the ban is put into place it’s not only for the user name but also includes IP addresses.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I am pretty tired (pretty rough night of data migration and deployment of this thing) so I am going to keep this post short and sweet. It’s been long overdue since our homepage refresh, but I would like to welcome you to the new iteration of the community forums. A lot of time has been placed into it and I hope you enjoy all the enhancements and features.</p>
<p>Please use this thread to post any feedback or bugs you may encounter. We will be taking the “shotgun” approach and will be adding in new features every week, keeping what sticks.</p>

            <p>I have been coming here regularly for years but almost never post.  I like to just surf the place.<br>
Anyway, recently I have started getting logged out while I am reading posts.  It is annoying to have to keep logging in again so I can keep reading.<br>
Is this a new feature or a personal problem?</p>
<p>My browser is Firefox Nightly if that helps.</p>

            <p>I couldn’t find a subforum for website suggestions, so I’ll just put this here unless a moderator has a better place in mind.</p>
<p>Is there any way to change the Date order to MM/DD/YY? As one of those Americans, I usually have to pause for a moment to take in the date and remember that it’s the DD/MM/YY style. It gets annoying from time to time.</p>
<p>Is there also an option to change the display of time to 12 hours instead of 24? I’d rather not take the time to memorize the 24 hour format when I’d be comfortable the 12 hour format.</p>

<li>Torrent file on MediaFire was removed. Please reupload it, or just leave a magnet link on the download page (I don’t see any reason to put a ~100 KiB torrent file to an external host).</li>
<li>Download links on GameFront are down as well. There could be others…</li>
<li>The download page says the total size is <span class="bbcode-b">3.8 GiB</span>, but all download mirrors say <span class="bbcode-b">3.08 GiB</span>.</li>
<li>Please provide hash values for the 2 files on the download page. Since the installer is on many mirrors, we need to verify its integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>Edit: Btw, is the song on homepage dropped? Unlike some crappy songs on other websites, I don’t find this song annoying at all. The piano sounds so good.</p>

          <title>Header image crossfade CPU utilization</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[mbit]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Website Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,<br>
When browsing the forums, whenever a header crossfade occurs, my Firefox CPU utilization jumps to 40-50%. The same in IE9.<br>
I’m not able to play games (like BM, for example) with an open BM forum tab on my second monitor. I just get a huge fps drop every few seconds.<br>
I think this amount of CPU time used to make the crossfade happen is not worth the result.</p>
<p>Could you somehow optimize the crossfade (by a factor of at least 10) or provide a cookie-backed option to disable crossfading?<br>
Alternatively provide workaround instructions to disable the crossfade clientside, like blocking a javascript file with a browser addon.</p>
<p>System Specs:<br>
Athlon64 6000+, 2x 3 Ghz<br>
Geforce GTX 660Ti<br>
While this system isn’t quite high-end, it can handle BM quite well, but struggles on rendering the website. Something is wrong here.</p>
<p>Also tried on my laptop, (i5 Sandy Bridge, 2410M, 4 HT cores).<br>
CPU utilization reaches 4-5% here. Doesn’t hurt that much, but still too much for a crossfade that most people don’t even pay attention to all the time.</p>

          <title>TO DEVS: Unnecessary Difficulty and Confusion</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Desolatemm]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Website Issues</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Black Mesa team,</p>
<p>First of all, congratulations on the completion of the mod. It is truly superb.</p>
<p>I would like to comment on the ability to download the correct files to instal the game. The official download link page is not appropriate for a mod of this caliber.<br>
Simple text instructions and a few links to file sharing sites misleads the customer to think that the process is easy. It should be, but it is not. The following were my experiences as a very computer savvy person.</p>
<p>The download link area is filled with malicious ads with fake buttons that read “Download”. Misleading, but quickly overcome. I saw that one of the two buttons was labeled as advertisement, but the other was not. I tried the download button of the other and it brought me to an unrelated site. No issue, exit the site and look for something else, but already a negative experience</p>
<p>I began checking the download mirror sites. I found most of the sites used were very confusing layouts and either do not have the correct files or any related files at all. There was not a single site link that contained all of the “Required” files. File Shack “cannot find files”, Game Front part 3 of 3 does not load on the site, AtomicGamer only has the .7z file, and so on. Eventually I did some research online. I found that I “could” install with only the BlackMesa.7z and BlackMesa-Setup.exe files, even though all the third-party installation guides show a BlackMesa.md5 file being needed. Okay so I have the two files I “Require” for the install. This was another negative experience because I had to dig for information that was not available from Black Mesa directly.</p>
<p>I begin installation by installing SDK base 2007. Then I exit Steam and ran BlackMesa-Setup.exe. I followed the instructions and there was a installation progress bar. It completed and asked if I wanted to run the game, I surely did. Steam launched, but an error occurred. Something to do with not finding a text file. So dug into my Program Files&gt;Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;Sourcemods&gt;etc and found that the files were never extracted. Instead, a copy of BlackMesa-Setup.exe, BlackMesa.7z, and magically BlackMesa.md5 were placed in a folder titled “Black Mesa”. Odd, so I ran the BlackMesa-Setup.exe in this location. The instructions were the same, but this time I could see that the files were being extracted at the installation progress window. Once completed, I double-checked the sourcemods folder and saw that all the files were now extracted. Yet another negative experience that there were no instructions for and I had to figure out on my own. I mean come on! The installation file didn’t even work correctly…</p>
<p>So after the files were extracted, the game ran correctly and all my frustration melted away as I jumped into my hazard suit.</p>
<p>This was my experience. It may not have been so difficult for others, but on the other hand it might have been even more difficult for some people. I wanted to voice my concern because you guys have put a tremendous amount of effort into this mod. It should be played by all and enjoyed by all. But the way things are set-up (or not) for downloading and installing the files (Properly!) is too difficult and a lot of potential players will be lost because of this. This process that I experienced will drive some people nuts to the point of giving up. It might not be worth the time for them to look into the issues as I have (albeit successfully).</p>
<p>I highly recommend that two things be done to improve the experience of the aspiring players:</p>
<p>Firstly, add an official “How-To” for the file installation. A process that you guys KNOW will work. Tell people where to put the files and exactly what files are required for the installation and what their function is. Add pictures of the process showing folder locations and examples. Show a step-by-step of the installation windows, simple, but helpful for some people. Show what is supposed to happen for a correct instal.</p>
<p>Secondly, ensure your download mirror sites are functioning properly. If they are not, fix the issue or remove the link. This added a lot of time and confusion to my installation experience. Also, I understand that advertisement is going to be present and set-up in a way that we, for lack of a better term, get tricked into pursuing. This just adds to the confusion. I would suggest making the download mirror sites stand-out more at least.</p>
<p>Again, this may not have been a huge issue for me personally and I was able to eventually achieve a successful download/instal. This is for the potential players that you are losing because of this set-up and lack of information. If this was any other run-of-the-mill Mod, I wouldn’t complain or suggest these things. But this is a high-caliber mod of a game that should be cherished and forever remembered in the history of Half Life.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>

<p>It doesn’t show properly - unless you’re hosting a black mesa mirror on your machine, I guess  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
