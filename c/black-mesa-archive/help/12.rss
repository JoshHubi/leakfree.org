          <title>Dark Areas/Overdark glitch</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Has anyone ever had an issue with the game where some places are just too dark to go through? It might be because of some of your computers specs or your computer might only be partially compatible. I have some solutions to remedy this problem.<br>
First (&amp; this worked the best for me), what you should do is open the developer console &amp; type in mat_monitorgamma_tv_enabled 1 to brighten up those darker areas. You might also have an issue with the flashlight too. Type in mat_dxlevel 95 to fix that too (note that it has to redownload light maps, so if it doesn’t have some sort of loading screen then you have to retry it by inputting the same code but replace 95 with 90, or you input the code wrong. But do this &amp; you can have a better experience. But make sure to put the codes in again every time you reload the game as the game resets anything put in the developer console. And don’t worry about the codes getting in the way of achievements. The codes are achievement friendly. I hope this post helps anyone.<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/ok_hand.png?v=9" title=":ok_hand:" class="emoji" alt=":ok_hand:"><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/fist_left.png?v=9" title=":fist_left:" class="emoji" alt=":fist_left:"><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=9" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>

            <p>Hi Black Mesa Forum <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>I’m playing Black Mesa on Manjaro Linux with a Asus Maximus Ranger VII Mobo, which has an Realtek ALC1150 Sound Chip, and connected via SPDIF (optical) a Logitech Z906 Soundsystem.</p>
<p>Surround Sound is working fine, for example, when playing a DVD.<br>
But in the options of Black Mesa I can only select a 2 Speaker setup.’<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/astonished.png?v=9" title=":astonished:" class="emoji" alt=":astonished:"><br>
Under Windows Surround Sound is working fine with Black Mesa.</p>
<p>Is there a way to enable surround sound in Black Mesa on Linux?</p>

            <p>So, I’m a new mod creator. I’m currently making my FIRST map for my FIRST mod but I’ve made GMod maps before though. I’m trying to get a scientist to sit down but it’s not working. When I tried with the actbusy, he doesn’t move. When I tried with scripted_sequence, he just magically disappeared. also, while we’re in the topic of scientists, How do you make his skin the Pre - Resonance Cascade skin?</p>

            <p>I’m thoroughly stuck in Zen. I have encountered the second throbbing receptacle that needs a power cord plugged in and a crystal inserted (assuming this) to do its thing. The cord has been plugged in but a long search of the area fails to come up with the crystal. I could use some assistance with this.</p>
<p>Note: I viewed the video walkthru for Xen but in the full release Xen has been changed and access to the area where the crystal is supposed to be located is blocked by a couple of huge leaves. I think I have shot everything in the vicinity but they won’t  get out of the way.</p>

            <p>I’m playing the latest version of BM on Steam - the completed one (March 2020). It’s uncommon for me ever to get stuck but I am. I’m in “Surface Tension” probably close to the end. I have crawled through a red-lit ventilation duct where there were a lot of annoying little bugs that munch away your health but finished them off with the Hive Glove. A bit farther on you hear voices and suddenly the floor of the duct falls out and you find yourself in a garage with some vehicles on hoists and a bunch of very hostile marines. I finish off the hostiles and help myself to the health booster on the far wall, then discover after much examination there is no way out.  I seem to recall in the incomplete release (maybe a year ago) when you wax the last marine there is an explosion which blows out a big window other side of the row of hoists. You then worked the hoists and jumped on the vehicles to hop up on some boxes on a shelf and then out the window. This time, the windows is unbtoken and can’t be broken even with the RPG.</p>
<p>Quite a few things were changed for this final release so maybe there’s a different escape route. If anyone has found it, I’d appreciate knowing.</p>

            <p>I’m using a windows 10 PC, I have a 4k Benq 60fps monitor, a GTX 1080 with 8gb of video RAM, a Ryzen 9 3900X, 64GB of 3000mhz Corsair Vengeance RAM and a 2TB samsung SSD to store it all.</p>
<p>I have no idea how 64gb of RAM and a GTX 1080 is not enough. I have tried several tricks already, like reinstalling the game, adding “-window -noborder”, disabling steam overlay, and yet every time I boot it crashes after a few seconds of loading screen.</p>
<p>I bought the game several years ago and this is the first time I’ve had this problem (I hadn’t launched since last year, but I was excited to play the new Xen levels until this happened)</p>

            <p>Hi, I have an issue with the latest Black Mesa version.<br>
The game runs at min. 100 to max. 250 FPS, but it doesn’t feel smooth when it’s under 150 FPS.<br>
I have a 75 Hz display, so 150fps should feel butter smooth.</p>
<p>My hardware:<br>
Ryzen 9 3900X<br>
RTX 2070 Super<br>
32GB RAM</p>
<p>I think the hardware is sufficient for Black Mesa, it also runs on a SSD.<br>
Did anybody encouter the same bug?</p>
<p>Kind regards, ´<br>
Nordik</p>

          <title>Bug in Black Mesa: involuntary shooting - ruining game</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[MrTea]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Help!</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, just joined this forum so my apologies if this has been covered already - I did a quick search but couldn’t find anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve found that BM has a very serious bug which is that, at apparently totally random intervals, my weapon will start to fire without me clicking the mouse. This is really annoying as it can alert enemies to me if I’m trying to sneak past them and of course wastes ammunition. I’ve made it to Xen so far, and am mainly staying on the crowbar or hive hand in order not to have to keep reloading to save ammo, which is very annoying although I can live with it. However, I’ve now come to the part where you have to navigate a room that’s been booby-trapped with exploding plants, and even a few hornets from the hive hand or a careless swing from the crowbar is enough to set them off and kill me.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this? On the Steam forums I saw someone had suggesting verifying the integrity of the game files, which I’ve done but to no avail.</p>
<p>This problem happens when I used either of my mice, doesn’t happen in any other game and I’ve even seen it continue to happen after I’ve unplugged the mouse, so I’m pretty sure it’s a problem with the game itself.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>Surface Tension Apache boss too easy?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not sure this is the right subforum, but anyway: I find the Apache boss fight a bit too easy. I tried multiplying all sk_apache_boss_stage_0/1/2/3_health numbers by 10 or 100 but could still shoot it down with two laser guided RPGs, hidden safely behind the rock pillar to the right side of the RPG crate, taking very little damage myself, and seemingly bypassing multiple boss stages in one hit.</p>
<p>About two RPG hits per stage seems a decent difficulty level, given the suit power and infinite rockets nearby. I made the CVAR changes before picking up the RPG launcher, since my initial guess was the helicopter boss would adopt my latest values as it spawned in, but it seems not to be the case; do these CVAR only take effect when the level is initially loaded?</p>
<p>Just trying to understand when the CVAR take effect, as I’m tweaking my own skill.cfg difficulty settings while I replay the earth levels before starting the Xen chapters (looking VERY much forward to this)!</p>

            <p>I have a custom texture for the Glock, but it only shows for a few seconds after I fire the Glock. I know I can fix this by screwing around with a vmt file, but I’m inexperienced with them because I mainly make TF2 skins, which don’t require a vmt file. Also, I’m on Steam. TL;DR, I need some help making a vmt file for the Glock, I’m on the Steam version.</p>

            <p>I’ve recently upgraded to an RTX 2070, and have been using a 4790K. I consider a few months “recently” in contrast to how long it’s been since I’ve played the game with my old setup, and since then I haven’t seen any performance improvements in Surface Tension after my upgrade. I can’t break 60 frames, neither can I pinpoint the issue. The in game settings SEEM to negate it as they’re set to satisfy a lower spec, but then comes the problem. Performance hasn’t increased since my change in hardware, no matter the setting.</p>
<p>I’m trying to run the game at max. The best example I can give of the performance I SHOULD be getting is that I get over 100 frames in Battlefield V on Ultra, which is currently the most demanding game I play.</p>

I tried reinstalling it, nothing. I tried verifying the intregity of my files, nope. I tried opening it by going into files and opening the bms, but I got nothing, not even when I ran as administrator. I tried going to the process section of task manager to find hl2.exe, but it isn’t there. I could really use some help.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I make Polish translation of the game.<br>
All working fine except resources from hl2 and platform directory.<br>
Even if I add modified version of this file to my custom vpk or to Custom folder (I add search paths to gameinfo before any other search paths), game will load original files.<br>
Only solution for now is replace or delete original files which I want to replace.</p>
<p>This is not elegant solution I don’t wanna modify/delete original game files.</p>
<p>This problem would not exist if game will respect polish language in steam interface settings.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
