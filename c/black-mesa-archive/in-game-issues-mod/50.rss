            <p>Just last night I was playing Black Mesa up to the end of the “Questionable Ethics” Chapter and everything was working just fine. I left from there, rejoined the game this morning and suddenly, ALL my weapons textures have changed to the purple and black checkerboard (missing textures). I checked the game files and the weapon texture files are all still there. The only thing I did between last night and this morning was verify my integrity for Source SDK Base 2007, and I also put ‘-dxlevel 9.0’ in the Set Launch Options for Black Mesa. Did doing any of those REALLY cause my weapons to lose their textures?!?!?!</p>

            <p>It’s a minor issue (not game breaking), but I got curious and decided to take one of the assassin’s glocks with me after the fight at the end of apprehension. Let the scene play out, and this happened (no I didn’t manually spawn it):</p>

<p>That said, it’s a minor issue. I’m honestly surprised this was overlooked.</p>

            <p>Hey guys. I could not find any solution to my problem, so I’ve got to post here. After update of my SDK 2007 I’ve launched BMS and I’ve got something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s800qjSFMh8/VPLvZo7J1uI/AAAAAAAAATs/6wr9ebxG-vg/s800/blackmesa.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>This squares are on and under every object in the game. Can someone help me, where could be problem? In-game engine, drivers or something else?</p>
<p>Before the SDK update this issue did not exist. Graphic card Radeon 7650M i think.</p>

          <title>[FIXED]Weird mouse acceleration-like/lag-like skipping</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[TheeSTALKER]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, once I started up a game i got into the intro cinematic. Then, when the train sequence commenced, I looked around a bit and then noticed that I got this very odd mouse lag. I’ve tried looking up over the internet, everything I found was not helpful for me.<br>
I tried:<br>
limiting fps to around 58<br>
m_customaccel 0, 1, 1.5 and 2<br>
reinstalling my mouse drivers<br>
restarting my pc<br>
putting in these launch commands: -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd<br>
turning v-sync and mouse smoothing on and off<br>
lowering graphical settings<br>
changing sensitivity<br>
sellecting all cores except one in task menager</p>
<p>However, none of those “fixes” worked.<br>
NOTE: during some moments, my mouse sensitivity would either raise or lower, it’s pretty random. And the skipping often came when I turned right with my mouse (even though it could skip every now and then). I also think it might be a problem with raw input, however I can’t enable it, there’s no command for it)</p>
<p>GPU: AMD Sapphire R9 270X Dual-X<br>
CPU: AMD FX 4300 Quad-core 3.80 GHz<br>
RAM: 2x4 GB (8GB)<br>
Windows 8.1 64-bit operating system.</p>
<p>I FIXED IT: I only had to download the Patch for Windows 8.1 called KB2908279 (it’s made for problems like these)</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So i had black mesa for a while now and i only recently noticed that the new game selection screen only shows  chapters 1-5 available and the backround menu only shows chapter 5’s backround, even though i have finished the game, the backround remains the same and the chapter selection still shows the ones available for selection are chapters 1-5. i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game but it it still shows the backround for chapter 5 and the new game selection still only goes up to chapter 5. I have tried the console command for all levels but when i exit and relaunch the game, the chapters still only show chapters 1-5 available for a new game. I have also tried uninstalling source sdk 2007 and reinstalling it, but no luck there. What can i do to solve this problem? its getting on my nerves. thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
I’ve just reinstalled Black Mesa to replay but the game crashes just after I wore the suit and take the lift to go down. The game try to load the new map but crashes. HL2 works fine, the last time I played BlackMesa (maybe a year ago…) it worked fine.<br>
map; bm_c1a0a, getpos setpos -1343.984863 1635.995361 352.031250;setang 17.413330 73.536987 0.000000. I’m taking the lift to go down. At the bottom the game try to load the new map but crashes.</p>
<p>My pc have a I7 2.8, 6GB RAM, AMD RAdeon 5800 1GB and I use win7 64 SP1 in Italian but hope you can understand…<br>

          <title>Please revisit hard difficulty balance</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[OCDMonkey]]></dc:creator>
          <category>In-game Issues (Mod)</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am currently replaying BM and chose to play it on hard this time, as in HL2 I find this difficulty to be the most fun. However, in BM, I have found it to be more aggravating as the devs seem to have balanced it right between HL &amp; HL2’s difficulty scheme, where HL made it an absolute pain to get through, and HL2 ramped up the difficulty without making you feel like you are a defenseless five-year-old. Now, I really do not mean to criticize the devs here, I know how hard it is to make a game and to properly balance it, but I do feel some changes need to be made. Here are some ideas I have come up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of my biggest complaints is with the HECU soldiers, as they feel like they have some sort of force field protecting them from harm. I think lowering their health slightly could go a long way in making hard feel better. (Another option would be to make there be less of them, as the Vorts seem to have similar health but aren’t as annoying because you are usually facing a max. of two of them at the most, however I like how many HECU there are, so that’s why I suggested what I did).</li>
<li>My other biggest complaint is that the SMG feels like I’m shooting a Nerf gun, in that it feels like it does no damage. In both HL and HL2 the SMG is one of my favorite weapons, but due to the damage output I just can’t primarily use it in BM. As with the last one, I think heightening the damage output of the SMG’s bullets would make the game feel SO much better in hard mode.</li>
<li>Explosions seem to have an almost nonexistent damage radius. This may just be because of the HECU soldier’s annoyingly high health, though.</li>
<li>The crossbow, although I like that it is actually effective unlike HL in hard difficulty, may need to be nerfed just slightly, or at least have a reduced number of ammo pickups. Please only do this if you lower the HECU sodier’s health, though, as right now this is the only good way to take them out.</li>
<li>On the part where you are on the dam the helli blows up a bridge on, please make there be more of a grace period between it shooting (and maybe make it shoot less at a time), as right now you are extremely lucky if you can make it back to an enclosure without dieing, let alone being able to destroy it. And I used all the crossbow ammo on the soldiers prior, so I wasn’t able to just dive into the water.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m sure there is more I’m not thinking of right now, but I would highly appreciate it if you would go through and find what is broken in your Hard difficulty. I really like this mod and would like to see it become as good as it can be. Thank you.</p>

          <title>Odd Black Screen Issue</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[shan9002]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi there! I am having a odd problem with Black Mesa. In certain spots, everything will just…disappear, including the HUD and the pause menu. If I take 1 or 2 steps away from the problem area, it all comes back, then go back to the area, and it disappears again. When this happens, the game is still playable, as in everything responds, there just isn’t a screen. This is a new problem, as I have been playing for awhile, and this problem just cropped up today, out of the blue. It seems to do it when I am near a object that gives off noticeable shade, or walls. Can’t post a vid because I tried and according to the video, it is all normal, no disappearing screen. Right now I am on Questionable Ethics. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

          <title>On a Rail - Section where tram can&#39;t reverse</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I noticed a very specific section of track where I can’t put the tram on reverse. If I try, the tram makes the same sound when trying to run into an obstacle and the lever does not move. The place where this happens is the straight length of track before the electrified pool of water where you have to reconnect a cable and lower a bridge. The coordinates are between:</p>
<p>-681.494263 -405.231873 784.031250<br>
and<br>
-677.585144 1761.287109 784.031250</p>
<p>For some reason after I lower the bridge the tram behaves normally again. And here’s a screenshot overlooking the water.<br>

            <p>I’m not exactly sure if this is really worth stating, but here I go, I guess. Basically, the beginning of blast pit - the part where you walk into the pipe that’s broken open after that railway sequence - has a ladder right here that you aren’t supposed to get to.<br>

I used the knockback from a grenade to hop to the other side. I continued down the direction the railway goes to find a black void. I walked through it, and now I’m under the map.<br>

<p>Dunno how to fix this. Line it with invisible walls maybe? I don’t know if it even matters, but hey, it’s me actually posting something outside of the lounge area of the forums, so there’s that.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>In my Black Mesa game, all the regular water is almost completely transparent (looking at it from the outside). The water sounds and swimming animation is there. Strangely I can see the radioactive fluids just fine.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Screenshots:</span></p>

<li><a href="https://pbrd.co/1tqjSvo" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pbrd.co/1tqjSvo</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The screenshots taken are from the dam in Surface Tension, but the issue affects all water throughout the game! Just to clarify…  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )</li>
<li>The issue is not related to the available command to make water gone! I tried that one already without any effect: <span class="bbcode-i">mat_drawwater 1</span>
</li>

<p>I am a bit confused, as I didn’t have this issue with the first version of BMS, but since updating to the most recent version. Additionally I installed the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=15754" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“On the rails uncut” extension</a> so as the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/showthread.php?t=14627" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">“Xen” maps</a>. Might I have messed something up by installing those?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Does anybody have a clue how I might investigate the root cause of this issue or even how to fix it (probably a missing/wrong file or something)?</span></p>
<p>Thanks for any help and ideas  <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>There are still a large number of community reported game bugs, some of them quite old, that are still classified as “Open” at the Atlassian Bitbucket website. Just wondering if and when these will be resolved or reclassified to an alternate category/status.</p>

          <title>Crash before the first map of Surface Tension</title>

            <p>Just before the first map of ST, when you press the button on the wall, the game crashes without an error message (just “hl2.exe stopped working”) and it doesn’t create any .mdmp files. I’m currently making a crowbar-only run, so I rushed this outdoor part without killing any enemies, could that be the source of problem? This crash never happened on numerous normal playthroughs. It happens every time I load a save so I’m stuck. Since I don’t have any crash report, I’ll link to save files:</p>
