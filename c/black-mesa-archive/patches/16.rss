<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Xen Engine Public Release</span></span><br>
We have patched the latest version of the Xen Engine and released it to everyone. Please let us know on the Steam forums if you run into any game breaking issues. As we have mentioned before, this is important to test our new features so that the Xen release can be as flawless as possible. We will probably do one more “Engine” release just before we drop Xen, in order to make sure that everything is running smoothly on everyone’s machines. We want the Xen release to be as close to a simple content release as possible! Here is what is in the latest patch:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">April Patch List</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screen freezes / crashes on Radeon RX 3XX 4XX 5xx cards!</li>
<li>Fixed most dynamic shadows flickering and improved the overall quality and performance</li>
<li>Fixed most dynamic lights flickering on lower quality levels Nvidia GPUs (and some AMD GPUs)</li>
<li>CSM quality and perf improvements</li>
<li>Fixed CSM not working on some AMD cards</li>
<li>Fixed decals flickering in some maps</li>
<li>Fixed full screen blur when using dynamic light godrays</li>
<li>Fixed zombie headshots with the crossbow. Now when you headshot a zombie using the crossbow, they will no longer spawn a live headcrab</li>
<li>Fixed assault points for Houndeyes</li>
<li>Added texture scrolling for dynamic light cookie textures</li>
<li>Fixed tilemap animation bug in light cookie textures</li>
<li>Fixed rim lighting not working with old light entities</li>
<li>Fixed Phong/skin shader specular not working on static props</li>
<li>Flashlight intensity and range increased</li>
<li>Settings optimization for new deferred lighting and shadows</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/362890/announcements/detail/1594703306631918308" data-bbcode="true">December Patch Notes</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Known Issues</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Flashlight Doesn’t Have Shadows</span><br>
We have a more advanced plan for the flashlight in the works. This will be deployed at a later date.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Haloing Around Props/Object </span><br>
MSAA is causing outlines around certain objects. MSSA is a performance killer and we hope to have a better solution for anti-aliasing with the Xen release. To remove the haloing/outline, simply turn off MSAA.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dynamic Shadows Flickering On Moving Dynamic Lights</span><br>
These should be completely fixed, but if you DO get them try:<br>
Try running the game in windowed borderless mode.<br>
Try turning off Vsync, lowering your overall settings, or turning off dynamic shadows entirely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stencil Shadows</span><br>
We have removed the old Source stencil shadows. This helps performance and fixes the double shadows that happen in outside environments where CSM is used. We plan on using new dynamic lights to get more realistic shadows in key interior sections.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Always Run</span><br>
Always run has an issue where after every map load you have to press “shift” for it to work. We will be fixing this for Xen.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Outlines Around Weapons</span><br>
If you move the screen fast in areas using dynamic lights, you may see small outlines around your weapon. This is very minimal and is something we will look into fixing.</p>

            <p>[align=center]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Surface Tension Update - Patch 2</span></span>[/size][/align]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Note:</span> This update does not contain Xen! We are hard at work on Xen. This is a small stability update aimed at lower-end users.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Programming</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a number of potential crashing issues on low-end graphics cards.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the depth buffer that was causing the game to crash for some users.</li>
<li>Fixed some instances of the “Disable CSM” option not working properly.</li>
<li>CSM/depth buffer will now be disabled completely by default on low-end graphics cards that are not officially supported.</li>
<li>Fixed mat_hdr_level &amp; mat_tonemapping_occlusion_use_stencil convars not working properly. This will hopefully help to resolve a sporadic issue for some users where the game would turn dark after a few seconds. If your game turns dark after a few seconds, try setting mat_tonemapping_occlusion_use_stencil to 1 in the console.</li>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>[align=center]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Surface Tension Update - Patch 1</span></span>[/size][/align]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Note:</span> This update does not contain Xen. We are working on Xen! This is a small hotfix patch to resolve some of the issues with the Surface Tension Update.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Programming</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>CSM should now be functional and working correctly on AMD cards.</li>
<li>French and Portugese translation/captions are added and fixed in the main menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where disabling CSM would cause it to set to “very low” when you next start the game.</li>
<li>Potentially fixed the “CSM ghosting” bug where a weird overlay would appear on the screen if you enabled CSM.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the godrays option would reset when the game is restarted.</li>
<li>cl_autoweaponswitch cvar added to disable automatic weapon switching, if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Level Design</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C2A5G (Surface Tension Uncut)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where if you backpedal through the door that leads to the car park at the beginning of the map, it would close and could not be reopened again.</li>
<li>Fixed invulnerable AGrunt at the helipad if the player tries to save the Osprey.</li>
<li>Fixed alternate vent route Headcrabs from clipping with the player and being invisible if they the player jumps over the vent gap.</li>
<li>Fixed various conditions that allowed the player to exit via the bomb trap room and get into the TOW courtyard that way.</li>
<li>Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">C2A5H (Surface Tension Uncut)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where the hangar Guard choreography would get broken if you went to the hangar door exit before reaching the part of the level where you actually meet the Guard.</li>
<li>Corrected hanger security door to use the correct sounds like the rest of the doors in the map.</li>
<li>Player clipped the dumpster by the jump pad to prevent the player from getting stuck.</li>
<li>Removed the fence behind the guard shack to prevent the player getting stuck.</li>
<li>Ladders on the fire escape now work in case the player decides to use the jump pad to get on them.</li>
<li>Fixed 50Cal getting tank projectiles stuck in it.</li>
<li>Add player clips to prevent exploitation of the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Multiplayer</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where sv_ranked would crash servers on startup.</li>
<li>Generated loading screens for dm_crossfire, dm_rail, dm_power and dm_chopper. All official maps should now have proper loading screens at all resolutions.</li>
<li>Added some graphical detail to a few areas in dm_rail as well as a playerclipping pass to make projectiles get caught less on silly obstacles.</li>
<li>Fixed c2a5h and c2a5i showing up on the multiplayer map list.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Miscellaneous/Notes</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Several big community mods have been broken with the last update. If you see missing textures or any strange behaviour, those are likely the cause. On a Rail Uncut is also broken and will cause texture errors in a few places in the game, particularly On a Rail. The author is working on fixing these issues.</li>

            <p>[align=center]<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://i.imgur.com/TU8oH1Y.jpg?1" title=""><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TU8oH1Y.jpg?1" alt="" width="690" height="255"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">851×315</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div>[/size][/align]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Highlights[/size]</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Tension: UNCUT! With an hour of gameplay added to the game!</li>
<li>High definition shadows, with the new CSM graphical feature!</li>
<li>Up to 75% faster load times. Fixed “Node graph out of date” on level load.</li>
<li>Official translation support for Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, and Spanish!</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">New Content and Features</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Note: This update does not contain Xen. We are working on Xen!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Surface Tension Uncut!</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We have lovingly recreated the previously missing Surface Tension maps, and restored them into Black Mesa’s main campaign! This adds three new maps - C2A5G, C2A5H, and C2A5I.</li>
<li>Added many new assets (textures, sounds, models, particles), and improved quality of many existing assets.</li>
<li>Existing Surface Tension maps C2A5B and C2A5E have been updated, providing areas with new design and gameplay.</li>
<li>Updated C3A1A, first map of Forget About Freeman, to use new Xen assets.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Cascaded Shadow Mapping (CSM)</span>
</li>
<li>Implemented Cascaded Shadow Mapping (CSM), which adds dynamic shadows to outdoor maps.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Vastly Improved Load Times</span>
</li>
<li>Maps load up to 75% faster.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Official Translation Support</span>
</li>
<li>Translated closed captions can now be enabled in the “Options &gt; Audio” menu. Currently supported languages are Finnish, German, Italian, Norwegian, and Spanish.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Artificial Intelligence</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Alien Grunt</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We made a significant number of tweaks and fixes to the alien grunt AI. Overall these fixes should significantly improve their intelligence, and mostly prevent moments where they behave weirdly or inexplicably.</li>
<li>Made sure multiple alien grunts can advance at once, if they belong to the same squad. This should prevent them rushing one by one and make them appear more coordinated.</li>
<li>Added patrolling schedule. Previously, when leaving the “combat” state, the alien grunt would drop straight back to “idle”. Instead of going straight from “combat” to “idle”, the alien grunt will now drop into the “patrol” state, where he cautiously walks around the combat area, looking for a target.</li>
<li>Changed fallback schedule. Instead of retreating, the alien grunt might now choose to patrol instead.</li>
<li>Changed behaviour when target is lost. Instead of immediately dropping to “patrol” state when the alien grunt’s active target is lost, the alien grunt will now attempt to establish line of sight with its lost target.</li>
<li>Target Prioritisation improvements. The alien grunt will now make far fewer switches between targets. His prioritisation for targets should now be much improved.</li>
<li>The alien grunt is no longer deaf. He was previously unable to react to sounds. We gave them the ability to hear things, so there will be fewer situations where he’s standing around doing nothing.</li>
<li>The alien grunt will now attempt to go into “advance” mode more often. This makes them more aggressive towards their target.</li>
<li>Implemented new behaviour when failing to complete a schedule (such as advance). This should reduce the number of situations where the AI does nothing. Instead, he will fire at the enemy or seek cover if possible. Patrolling is still possible from this situation, but should be less frequent.</li>
<li>Made it so the alien grunt’s advance schedule can cheat a bit. The alien grunt may now traverse the full route to a player.</li>
<li>Fixed the condition for the alien grunt’s melee attack. The condition which determines the alien grunt’s ability to melee attack, COND_MELEE_ATTACK1, would ignore the height of the target. This is fixed.</li>
<li>Lowered the alien grunt’s hivehand firerate. This makes fighting alien grunts less frustrating: you’re not constantly being pelted by bees.</li>
<li>Lowered the alien grunt’s rest interval min and max values, to give the alien grunt a lower rest time between firing bursts. This is to compensate for him being given a slightly lower rate of fire.</li>
<li>Lowered the minimum range of the alien grunt’s hivehand. This prevents a situation where the alien grunt cannot melee or shoot the player.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Alien Slave</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We fixed a serious bug in the alien slave’s AI routine. An AI loop created a situation where the Alien Slaves would stop and ignore the player during combat.</li>
<li>The alien slaves can hear the player now. Previously, they were incapable of reacting</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">HECU Fixes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The HECU’s accuracy is now significantly reduced (halved) while they are running, using the parameter “npcmovementinaccuracypenaltymultiplier”, which can be found in weapon_mp5.dmx.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Balance</span>[/size]</span></p>
<p>Did a small balance pass across the game to address some community concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reload Stops. Once a new magazine is loaded, weapons will remain loaded after a weapon switch, even if the reload animation was not completely finished.</li>
<li>Increased crowbar range from 40 to 56. This should make it easier to fight zombies with the crowbar.</li>
<li>Re-balanced explosive weapons. Previously, all explosive weapons had uniform damage and radius. Now there are 3 levels of explosive weapon:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Basic-Tier:</span> 100 damage, 250 radius (frag grenades, MP5 grenades)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Mid-Tier:</span> 150 damage, 300 radius (satchel charges, tripmines)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Top-Tier:</span> 175 damage, 300 radius (RPG)</li>
<li>Apache health increased from 200 to 400. This compensates for the nearly doubled RPG damage; the required number of RPG shots to destroy an Apache only increases by 1. This also brings the RPG and tau’s effectiveness against vehicles closer together. These changes do not affect the Apache on the dam map, only the boss fight on the cliffside map.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Tau</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The tau has been rebalanced, mostly for MP. It will still remain one of the most powerful weapons in the game, but should be tougher to use at maximum effectiveness. This forum post outlines the changes in great detail.</li>
<li>Adjusted the code for the tau’s overcharge bias. Previously, the overcharge bias adjusted the cosine wave for the tau’s damage vs total charge. Now, the overcharge bias value dictates the point at which the tau reaches 50% damage value.</li>
<li>Tau overcharge bias changed from 0.9 to 0.85. This reflects the overcharge bias’s new function, and means the tau will do 50% of its total damage at 0.85 total charge. It then abruptly ramps up to 100% total damage at 1.0 total charge. This should make it much tougher to chain together half charged tau shots, because they are now ineffective.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the tau’s overcharge bias function. This value was not normalized, effectively meaning that the tau was only taking 1 second to fully charge in MP, rather than the intended 1.25 seconds. This is now corrected.<br>
Increased tau jump velocity from 500 to 650. This improves the effectiveness of tau jumping, and also adds utility to non fully charged shots.</li>
<li>Depending on how these changes play out in MP, we may adjust the tau’s damage or total charge time in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Programming Bug Fixes</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed “Node graph out of date” message displayed on each level load.</li>
<li>Fixed a Windows XP crash. Fixed a bug which prevents Windows XP users from launching the game.</li>
<li>Cleaned and optimized shaders. All shaders below DX9 are removed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to satchels.</li>
<li>“Always Run” option is fixed/updated. When using always run, the sprint animations and sounds do not play.</li>
<li>Added “Caption Language” setting. Caption language can now be set in  “Options &gt; Audio” menu.</li>
<li>Fixed outstanding bugs with crossbow animations.</li>
<li>Updated shotgun gibbing code. Gibbing should only occur at close range, and only from a double blast.</li>
<li>Added “reload points” to all reloadable weapons. Previously, weapons were only considered “reloaded” when the reload animation was complete. Now, weapons take into account the point at which a magazine was inserted to determine when they are reloaded.</li>
<li>Fixed disappearing throwables. Fixed a bug where throwables would appear invisible after loading a saved game.</li>
<li>Colour correction enabled.</li>
<li>Drowning sound fixed. The bubbly drowning sound would always play when you come into contact with water. This is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added old save notification. Loading a saved game from an older version of Black Mesa will display a notification to the user.</li>
<li>Extended depth buffer range to render entire scene.</li>
<li>Implemented Portal 2 resource caching system.</li>
<li>Fixed crossbow scope refraction. Refraction images on crossbow scope now display correctly when not zoomed in.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Models</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated older existing assets with new models and textures, as part of our continued effort to unify all the game’s assets and bring them up to a higher standard.</li>
<li>Fixed crossbow collision and lighting origin.</li>
<li>Fixed the sheen effect on the RPG world model.</li>
<li>Lowered the resolution of the shotgun world model texture.</li>
<li>Fixed fullbright tau world model.</li>
<li>Removed empty alpha maps from some materials.</li>
<li>Lowered resolution of texture maps for satchel and crossbow world models.</li>
<li>Fixed jump pad animation in SP.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Single Player Level Design</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">bm_c1a1c</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frozen lab soundscape occasionally not triggering when entering the area.</li>
<li>Fixed the coolant puzzle so that players can no longer get stuck behind a pipe.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c1a3c</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the rappelling marines. They should no longer fall all the way down the shaft, but if they do, the fall will now kill them.</li>
<li>Added air raid siren to the airstrike section.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c1a4a</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed soundscapes not playing after descending through the lift shaft.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c1a4b</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with some vent lighting.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a2a</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed tram being unable to reverse when approaching the bridge.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a2b</span>
</li>
<li>The .50 cal turret will now default to facing forwards when players release control.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a2c</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed broken appearance of moon texture.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a3a</span>
</li>
<li>Players can no longer backtrack to On a Rail.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in Ichtyosaur scene which prevented players from progressing forward.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a4f</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed problems with marine encounter in cryogenics scene.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a4h</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed exterior soundscape so that it will correctly play when exiting the tunnel.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a5a</span>
</li>
<li>Removed the icy material property from the gravel at the start of the map.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a5b</span>
</li>
<li>This map had some major sections redone. The side route should be much more interesting to explore and much more rewarding now.</li>
<li>Overall this map should look, play, and feel a lot more up to standard than it did before.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a5c</span>
</li>
<li>Fixed a missing soundscape when exiting the walkway via the shack window.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c2a5e</span>
</li>
<li>Detailed up the outdoor area with some new foliage and rock props, as well as miscellaneous detail fixes.</li>
<li>Added a set of player spawn equipment at the start of the map if the player chooses to restart the level.</li>
<li>Disabled the explosion death effect until the player is inside the explosive warehouse. This fixes a bug where players could accidentally trigger the explosion from outside the warehouse, or could get stuck in a save game loop.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">bm_c3a1a</span>
</li>
<li>Made the Xen slime and growths consistent with other areas throughout the game.</li>
<li>Cleaned up AI nodes to improve NPC navigation.<br>

          <title>Black Mesa Public Beta Patch - Jan 23rd</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fr0z3n]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Patches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey guys, we’ve released a Beta Patch this afternoon for the Black Mesa Public Beta. Ontop of the previous fixes from the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28784-Black-Mesa-Public-Beta-Patch-Jan-13th-2016/?pageNo=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">previous beta patches</a>. The notes are as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed extremely long loading times on game launch. Now, it should launch as quick as, if not faster than, the main version of the game</li>
<li>Fixed game_round_win Entity to actually win</li>
<li>Fixed bouncing Bolts from the crossbow in MP</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the balanced spawn system</li>
<li>Fixed Shotgun Collision model</li>
<li>Fixed various spelling errors and missing .wav files in dialouges.</li>
<li>Fixed the Crossbows lighting origin</li>
<li>RPG rocket won’t clip with the rocket when reloading.</li>
<li>Dr. Kleiners head and hands are now properly smooth (smoooooth as jazz)</li>
<li>Fixed blood not splattering on the MP5</li>
<li>Fixed the where placing 11 satchels crashed the MP server</li>
<li>Disable Muzzleflash option will not properly work</li>
<li>Various fixes/tweeks to Crossfire</li>
</ul>
<p>Things we know about (this list is actually much longer, but I am listing the bugs that are the most known and/or we’re currently working on fixing).</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshop Addon button in the main menu does not work</li>
<li>Grenade explosion time is 1second longer (We seriously don’t know whats happened).</li>
<li>Various things with the workshop still need work.</li>
<li>Various other things that I don’t have in front of me right now.<br>
Also: If you’re having issues with Missing textures or models and you have used mods (presently, or in the past) you will need to do the following steps to fix the missing asset problem:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Unsubscribe from all Black Mesa mods</li>
<li>Go to SteamApps\workshop\content\362890</li>
<li>Delete all folders within this folder</li>
<li>Restart Black Mesa, and you should be good to go.<br>
Once you do this, you should be able to re-subscribe to mods.</li>
</ol>
<p>What was happening is that with the new system, there was some misdirection of filepaths based on the old system, that was leading to the missing asset problem. (It’s weird).</p>
<p>Anyways, thats it for now. This thread is for talking about these bugs, and these bugs only. If you have any additional bugs that you wish to report, please do so in the <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28724-Crossfire-Update-Known-Bug-List/?pageNo=1" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Crossfire Update - Known Bug List</a></p>
<p>If you don’t know how to use the Black Mesa Public Beta, read these steps: Right click on in your steam browser, click “Properties.” Go to the Beta Tab. Select “Public Beta.” You’re now in the Public Beta! If you no longer want to be part of the public beta branch, you can go back to the Beta’s tab under properties, and set your beta to “none - Opt out of all betas.” When you opt in, you’ll see a download happening, that’s perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone with your help so far. We hope to be moving all these out of the Public Beta branch, and into the main game in the next few days.</p>

          <title>Black Mesa Public Beta Patch- Jan 13th 2016</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fr0z3n]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Patches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey everybody!</p>
<p>This isn’t actually a new patch, it’s been out for a little while now. I’m comfortable with what we have now though to kind of publically say “we have issues fixed and we need help checking!” A reminder though is that this is a BETA patch. Which means that the fixes are intended to work, but may not work as intended. (buggy bug fixes!).</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying things out, or if there is a fix for something that you’re interested in, you can opt-into the public beta <em>right now!</em> (if you own the steam version of the game). To participate: right click on in your steam browser, click “Properties.” Go to the Beta Tab. Select “Public Beta.” You’re now in the Public Beta! If you no longer want to be part of the public beta branch, you can go back to the Beta’s tab under properties, and set your beta to “none - Opt out of all betas.”  When you opt in, you’ll see a download happening, that’s perfectly normal.</p>
<p>As of Jan 13th, 2016 the Public Beta changes from the Crossfire Update are as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added muzzle flash dynamic light checkbox to options menu.</li>
<li>Added godrays enable checkbox to the options menu</li>
<li>Minor optimizations made to netcode.</li>
<li>Crossfire performance optimizations.</li>
<li>Fixed ‘FIX IT DENIZ’ skin on monitor in UC.</li>
<li>Polished the workshop tool. (like, it works now, and you can upload thumbnails).*</li>
</ul>
<p>[list][<em>]ingame UI for the “workshop addons’” button in the menu is a much larger bug, so it has not been fixed. the rest of the uploader is working better now.<br>
[/</em>:m][/list:u]</p>
<p>*The workshop tool now places mods in the SteamApps/Workshop/Content/362890 folder. When you subscribe to a mod, it will add a folder with the mods ID, to that folder. The uploader will recognize .vpk mods and non-.vpk mods. It is preferred and considered good practice if you make a .vpk mod. (I will provide instructions on how to do that, later).  I will be creating a full ‘how to upload a mod’ guide here soon.</p>
<p>There may be more things that are fixed that I have missed.</p>
<p>Please keep this thread to JUST the public beta fixes. This is not the place to discuss what needs to be fixed, or bugs that haven’t been fixed yet and/or ‘why haven’t you fixed XYZ bug?’ discussions. If I see that the discussion is moving off-topic, I will move or remove posts as necessary. Thanks!</p>
<p>Known issue:<br>
Loading times for Black Mesa for launching the first time during a computer session is longer than it should be.</p>

          <title>Fixing Issues with Latest Patch (Content Update 0.1.0)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[TextFAMGUY1]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As you may or may not be aware, we just released our first big content update! You can <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/28318-Content-Update-0-1-0/" data-bbcode="true">view the details here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are having strange issues with the latest content update, it is most likely to do with using old save games from before the update. Unfortunately, Source and old save games do not seem to handle updates very well.</p>
<p>It appears the issues do not happen if you start a new game. If you are experiencing weird bugs (such as having zombie hands in SP, health chargers not working, sprint being stuck on), try starting a new game from whatever chapter you were on. You will lose your progress in the chapter, but the bugs will be resolved.</p>
<p>You may still find sprint is stuck permanently on. If that is the case, you just need to untick “always run” in the Black Mesa tab of the options menu.</p>
<p>We apologise for the inconvenience, but the way Source handles saves with updates is unfortunately something we have very little control over.</p>
<p>Thanks for playing, we hope that aside form this minor blip that you guys love the patch!</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">MULTIPLAYER CHANGES</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>dm_stack!</p>
<ul>
<li>Added dm_stack! dm_stack is a brand new, outdoor, fun map designed for smaller player counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>dm_gasworks</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted weapon placements in quite a few places:</li>
</ul>
<p>[list][*]Gluon Gun has been moved slightly (though is still on the same tower), to a position up high. It is now perched on top of a pipe on the same tower, and can now only be reached by hopping up to it from the railings, so requires 2 (simple) jumps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both uranium packs removed from Gluon spawn.</li>
<li>Removed one uranium pack from the hole Tau Cannon spawn.</li>
<li>One of the batteries on the tower bridge replaced with a uranium pack.</li>
<li>Added a clip of Crossbow ammunition on the red tower.</li>
<li>Removed a clip of Crossbow ammunition from the middle building.</li>
<li>Added 2 frag grenades in the top middle shack on the surface.</li>
<li>Replaced the MP5 by the forklift with a Shotgun with one ammo pack.</li>
<li>Adjusted the positioning of the RPG Fort’s pickup so the RPG no longer appears to be floating.</li>
<li>Removed both batteries from the ibeam on top of the elevator shaft. Removed one uranium pack from there too.</li>
<li>Added 2 frag grenades by the planks in the control room (which form a ramp to drop out the control room window).</li>
<li>Removed one ammo pickup from the Shotgun on the upper catwalks in the underground cavern.</li>
<li>Added a second MP5 grenade to the MP5 pickup on the underground tower.<br>
[/<em>:m][</em>]Tweaked lighting and player direction in a few areas:</li>
<li>In the underwater swimming routes (01 and 02), added caution stripes surrounding the entrances to make them much more obvious to players.</li>
<li>Brightened up the lighting surrounding the swimming routes to make them stand out more.</li>
<li>Added a large spotlight shining onto swimming route 02, to make it stand out better as a major route.</li>
<li>In the underwater part of the elevator shaft, added a fill light so the underwater section is no longer dark.</li>
<li>Added a red light at the base of the elevator ladder, to make the route more apparent.</li>
<li>Significantly brightened up the light from the elevator shaft teleporter, to make that part more obvious at a first glance.</li>
<li>Next to the conveyor drop down, turned on a light next to the double doorway, to make that major route area less dark from outside, and improve player visibility.<br>
[/*:m][/list:u]</li>
</ul>
<p>dm_subtransit</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverted the tram back to the original 1-car style. The DREADNAUGHT is no longer ingame, we felt that while it was fun, it was too buggy to be reliable or useful.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">MODEL CHANGES</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Added first person zombie hands model for zombie scientists</li>
<li>Added first person zombie hands model for zombie guards</li>
<li>Added first person guard hands model</li>
<li>Updated first person scientist hands</li>
<li>Added G-Man as a playable multiplayer character.</li>
<li>You can now get blood on the MP5.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PROGRAMMING CHANGES</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed the ragdoll bug where occasionally the Vortigaunts/Marines corpses would spawn in a T-pose/be behaving extremely oddly after loading a save game or level transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusted RPG reloading mechanics to be more in line with HL1. Now, if you fire your RPG with the laser on, you cannot reload it until the rocket has detonated. If you fire with the laser off, and press reload, you are able to reload it even while the rocket is still in the air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusted Shotgun reload so you can interrupt the reload properly by firing, and it will fire instantly, instead of waiting for the current shell to be loaded first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tau Cannon adjustments:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[list][*]Tau Cannon full charge time in MP is reduced from 1.5 seconds to 1.25 seconds, to better match the original Half-Life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tau Cannon full charge ammo usage reduced from 12 uranium to 10 uranium, to better match the original Half-Life.</li>
<li>Tau Cannon jump velocity reduced from 1100 to 850, to bring it closer to HL1 and to make it a bit less ridiculous and easier to control.</li>
<li>Tau Cannon hitreg fix - fixed a bug in the Tau Cannon’s hit registration that was making it register unreliably.</li>
<li>Tau overcharge volume reduced from SNDLVL_100dB to SNDLVL_norm.<br>
[/<em>:m][</em>]Crossbow adjustments:</li>
<li>Zooming in with the Crossbow is now instant in MP. Welcome back, quickbow!</li>
<li>The Crossbow’s zoomed shot is now properly lag compensated, so should now register more reliably.<br>
[/<em>:m][</em>]Voice chat is now enabled in MP and is bindable via the options menu![/*:m][/list:u]</li>
</ul>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The new patch is released! Introducing Black Mesa <span class="bbcode-b">0.0.2!</span></p>
<p>This is a much larger patch than the last one. We hope that this patch has resolved most of the serious performance issues and stuttering in multiplayer. See the full changelog below:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">PROGRAMMING CHANGES</span></span>[/size]</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance fixes: Dynamic lights removed from muzzle flashes and explosions. These were causing stuttering and performance issues in MP, which should now be fixed. Dynamic light options removed from menu as they no longer do anything.</li>
<li>Loading screens: Our flashy loading screen system now works properly for MP on secured servers (the majority of servers). Previously they only worked on unsecured and listen servers. Also made some updates to the loading screens’ appearance to make them a bit nicer.</li>
<li>Spawn system: Fixed all players penetrating each other to death over a single spawn point during round resets.</li>
<li>Chat box exploit: Fixed a recently discovered bug which affects all Source games and allows players to execute commands on all players using the chat box, potentially crashing the server.</li>
<li>Tripmine hitbox: Doubled the size of the Tripmine hitbox to make it easier to shoot.</li>
</ul>

            <p>We believe the latest patch has resolved the issue where the game will launch in fullbright, meaning it has no lighting. This should be resolved for any more first time players. However, if you have previously had fullbright, it is possible that you may still have the problem. Here is the fix.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what “fullbright” means, this is how the game is supposed to look:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://i.imgur.com/1AUyam7.jpg" title=""><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1AUyam7.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">960×540</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This is how fullbright looks:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://i.imgur.com/9Ot7LGx.jpg" title=""><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9Ot7LGx.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">960×540</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>This issue can be resolved by entering in the following commands into the console (tilde key ¬, normally to the left of 1) at the Black Mesa main menu. If the console does not work, you can enable it from the advanced keyboard settings.</p>
<p>mat_hdr_level 2<br>
mat_fullbright 0</p>
<p>However, it is possible that after this, when you get in game, the game is still fullbright. If the game is still fullbright while playing it, you must open the console while in game, and enter the same commands:</p>
<p>mat_hdr_level 2<br>
mat_fullbright 0</p>
<p>Once that is done, this should permanently resolve the issue. If it does not, try starting a new game on any chapter of your choosing - we have noticed that fullbright saves often have problems with the game reverting to fullbright.</p>
<p>If you are STILL experiencing issues with fullbright, following all of this, please follow the debugging steps we detailed in <a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/index.php/Thread/27945-Fullbright-Issues-The-team-needs-data-to-fix-it/" data-bbcode="true">this thread.</a> This will help us gather more information on the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>
