            <p>Hey guys, was wondering if you might have some insight to help me here. I’m trying to install the Logitech Gaming Software to configure my mouse, and it’s binds. Whenever I try to run the installer, it just opens up my user folder (users&gt;“myname.exe”) instead of actually installing the software. Any ideas on how to actually get it installed? I’m a little stumped. Am I missing something really obvious? Thanks in advance!</p>

          <title>Beyond Good and Evil - many issues</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Johnwalter]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just downloaded a free copy of Beyond Good and Evil from Ubisoft 30 Years. (You can get your copy to that you will have forever, but it is offered for a short time)</p>
<p>First and biggest issue is lag. The game runs smooth in the menu, but in-game, when the intro starts, it lags crazy, huge frame rate drop, bellow 10 FPS.<br>
I tried many different options in the Advanced Settings tab, but it didn’t help. I also tried a patch from MODDB: <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moddb.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil</a> but i couldn’t patch it<br>
because the patch didn’t recognise an installed game.<br>
Then i tried the ENB mod. Finally some improvement. With the ENB mod, the game is able to run perfectly smooth, but now it has new issues.<br>
Sudden screen flickering, HUD appearing and dissapearing during cutscenes or mid-game, textures and models also dissapearing from scenes.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Hello, I apologise that my first thread isn’t very helpful to the other folks that have been here longer than I have, but I do wish to know what, for the more scientifically-inclined/Stormseeker, these snippets of the asset c2a4x_labboard say:</p>

<p>The former has a Feynman diagram accompanying it, and the latter an equation. I can upload them if you wish.</p>

            <p>Hello, I’m interested in building a rig that could run any of the new games on max specs, on vr more specifically on the oculus rift, money is an issue as always but I’m not willing to compromise quality but also I don’t want to over do it by buying the most expensive parts and not use them to their full capacity as I did in the past, so if anyone’s good at this stuff could you please give me some direction, thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi all! I’ve recently acquired an NTSC PS1 and slim PS2 and barring the PS2 (got component cables), I was wondering how I would hook up the PS1 using SCART to get RGB output. Hoping to get any thoughts and ideas on this. Thanks!</p>

          <title>Half-Life 1 + Expansions low framerate</title>

            <p>So I just got a new laptop that’s pretty nice, at least for what I’m used to. But the weird thing is, I’m getting a pretty low frame rate (45 fps) in Half-Life 1, Opposing Force, and Blue Shift. Which is weird because I get over 100 FPS in the stand alone version of Sven coop, which is the same engine as Half-Life. And I run other games such as Black Mesa at a pretty decent framerate at moderately high settings. I turned of VSync in the game options and in my Nvidia graphics options and that still did not fix the problem. I haven’t had this problem on any other computer and I was wondering if anyone here knows how to fix it.  I made sure my graphics drivers are up to date as well. Here is what I’ve got:</p>
<p>Computer Type: (Star Wars Special Edition) HP Pavilion Notebook</p>
<p>Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz  2.59 GHz (Dual Core)<br>
GPU: Nvidia GeForce 940M<br>
RAM: 8.00 GB<br>
System Type: 64-Bit Operating System, x64-based processor<br>
Resolution: 1920 x 1080, 60Hz<br>

          <title>Having Issues with my Gaming Computer</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>About 3 weeks ago, I was finishing up playing Resident Evil Revelations 2. When I turned off the game, an update for Metal Gear Online PC came up. When I attempted to play an online match after updating the computer and changing some graphics settings) the online game started taking longer than usual to get in. When it finally let me in, parts of the game were not rendering properly. I ended up deciding to shutdown the computer, but as I was doing so, I noticed that it was taking longer than usual for it to shutdown. Rather than wait for it to finish shutting down on its own, I decided to manually turn off the computer.</p>
<p>By doing that, whenever I try to start up the computer, it now takes a very long time to get from turning on to getting out the Windows 7 loading screen (instead of taking less than a minute like it normally would). Once it gets out of that, the screen has nothing but black and white lines <a href="https://images1.pixlis.com/background-image-horizontal-lines-and-stripes-seamless-tileable-black-white-22h3ep.png" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">like this</a> (except much thicker). I’m not sure what the main source of the problem is. I hope I can get some help solving this issue as I want to use my gaming computer again as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My computer specs:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Premium x64 SP1<br>
CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1090T<br>
RAM: 16Gb Corsair 1333MHz<br>
GPU: Sapphire Radeon HD 7770 Crossfire<br>
MOBO: Gigabyte GA-890FXA-UD5<br>
PSU: Corsair TX 650W 80+ Bronze<br>
Storage: Seagate Barracuda 1TB<br>
Case: Antec Three Hundred Black Steel ATX Mid Tower</p>

            <p>Hey guys, so I’ve recently come across a decent sum of cash. 1500 to be exact. And I’d like to graduate to a higher end setup to game on, so that I can join the ranks of people truly enjoying PC gaming. Any suggestions from anyone on what kinda hardware and software to buy? Guides on how to build it, or places to buy from where they build it for you?</p>
<p>I don’t have very much technical knowledge with these things, but I would like to get into the high end PC gaming scene, and off of my crappy laptop. Any help at all would be appreciated, and since I know a lot of you guys are much better at this than anyone I personally know, that’s why I’m turning to you all. I’d google it, and I will of course before deciding, but I’d like everyone’s suggestions as well to help set me on the right path.</p>
<p>Edit: also, what’s everyone’s thoughts on gaming laptops versus rigs? I like the convenience of a laptop but if a rig is honestly a better buy then I’ll take that.</p>

            <p>It kinda makes me laugh to see my avatar on two other threads on just this first page of this section. But again, I need some help.</p>
<p>So, I’ve already made a thread about this in 2 other places, because I’ve been having this problem since the start of October, so I’ll just get to the point.</p>
<p>I used to have port 25565 forwarded on my router so I could host a private Minecraft server with my friend, so her and I could play together without others interfering.</p>
<p>It went well for the longest time, but then suddenly it just kinda stopped working. The only thing potentially related would be that I upgraded to Windows 10 recently before it happened.<br>
The port is listed as open in my router’s settings, and my IP is still static and still the same, but the server doesn’t work, and neither <a href="http://PortForward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">PortForward.com</a>’s software, nor <a href="http://CanYouSeeMe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">CanYouSeeMe.org</a> detected my port as open, with the latter stating that the connection timed out.</p>
<p>I can say 100% without a doubt that it’s not a firewall interfering, as both my 3rd party firewall and Windows firewall have explicit rules to allow traffic through port 25565, incoming and outgoing. Upon checking Windows’s firewall log, the incoming connection isn’t even making it to Windows firewall when I test the port. It’s detecting the connection outgoing, but incoming isn’t even being logged.<br>
All I can figure is it’s something in the router, but I have no idea how it would have changed on its own. However nothing is showing in the event log.</p>
<p>I’m using a Motorola SBG6580 provided by Time Warner.</p>
<p>I really hope someone here can help. I posted a support thread on the Minecraft Forums too (I figured at least <span class="bbcode-i">someone</span>there would have had the same issue), but after 3 months of being there I haven’t had any helpful responses.</p>

          <title>Severely lacking inspiration</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, over the past year or two I’ve fallen blindly in love with Hammer. It started out in Portal 2, when I wanted to recreate one of my favorite levels from Portal 1 in the newer aesthetic and found the ingame level maker atrociously limiting, and since then I’ve tried branching out to other games, including CS:GO, TF2 and Black Mesa.<br>
But no matter where I go, or how long I think, there’s always one thing stopping me from doing it more:<br>
Inspiration. I’m at a sort of artist’s block, if you will. I’m not exactly a master at Hammer, I’d honestly barely rank myself above a beginner, and I desperately <span class="bbcode-i">want</span> to learn more and create maps that I feel are worth releasing. But I don’t have anything to make.<br>
I’ve redesigned almost all of Portal’s chambers countless times and even now, with the season incoming, I’m trying my hand at making a Halloween-themed ctf_turbine for TF2. But I don’t have any <span class="bbcode-i">original ideas</span> to push myself to keep going.</p>
<p>So, now that I’ve shared my life’s story in a short ramble, anyone have any inspiring ideas? Even if it’s something simple (actually I’d prefer simple considering my aforementioned skill-level), I just need an idea, something that hasn’t been done 10,000 times over, that pulls the right lever in my head to get me going, y’know?<br>
Right now my only limitations are assets from the games I own (I wouldn’t mind learning to make those some day either, I already have Blender installed). For reference, I own every Source Engine Half-Life game, every Counter-Strike, TF2, both Portals, and L4D2. Oh and the Steam release of Black Mesa, naturally.<br>
I hope I’m not asking too much.</p>

          <title>UE4 help?  Camera shake by keypress?</title>

            <p>Hey, folks!</p>
<p>I’m looking to elicit help in the UE4 engine for a project. Here’s what I’m trying to do:</p>
<p>I’m looking to set up a camera shake, such as being nudged or something, via a keypress. So, for example, the camera is stationary and looking at something, then you press a key on the keyboard, such as the F key, then the camera shakes. I don’t want any effects associated with it beyond camera movement. I don’t want explosions or whatnot… just the camera movement.</p>
<p>Is that possible in UE4? It should be, but I can’t for the life of me figure it out.</p>
<p>I tried contacting the UE4 forums about this but I have not yet received a response about it after more than a day of waiting so any help I can get from you fine people would be wonderful!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Heya, so I updated to windows 10 with the free update Microsoft let out and now none of my source games run correctly. Particularly Day of Defeat Source in this instance, I cannot open any servers at all and it simply crashes and freezes the screen while I can hear everything going on in the background. Has anyone had this problem on Win10, with any game, and managed to fix it? Everything worked fine before, on 8.1.</p>

          <title>Awful Screen Artifacting After Win10 Update</title>

            <p>I updated to Windows 10 a couple days ago, and now, after about 5-20 minutes of using my computer, my monitors start artifacting badly whenever the content on the screens changes by anything more than slightly moving the cursor. The problem is fixed for another 5-20 minutes by restarting. The artifacts are flashes of static that appear to be the screen’s content flashing discolored and distorted offset diagonally.</p>
<p>I updated my display drivers to no effect. I’ve got an R9 290 and two 2560x1440 monitors.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

          <title>Finally on track for new mobo/proc (advice needed)</title>

            <p>Greetings, forumites!</p>
<p>So, I’m finally ready to purchase a new motherboard and processor, but I’m not sure what to look for, so I’d thought I’d ask you lovely people for advice now that I’m ready to buy.</p>
<p>I am looking for something that I can hopefully port my RAM over to.  I currently have 16GB of DDR3 RAM and would like to use that on the new motherboard if possible, with possible room for expansion later.  The main goal of this new motherboard and processor is to help render 3D animations.</p>
<p>I would also like to port over my current video card (NVidia GeForce GT 640) with possible upgrade later.</p>
<p>My budget is US$700 and I want to get the best bang for my buck.</p>
<p>What do y’all recommend?  i7?  Something else?  Brand?  Processor?  Whatever you guys have to say, I’d love to hear it!  And if you have any questions, I’ll be happy to answer them!</p>
<p>Thanks! <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/thumbsup.png?v=9" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji" alt=":thumbsup:"></p>

            <p>Hey, folks.</p>
<p>I signed up with Microsoft to be notified when Windows 10 will be available to so I can make a decision as to whether to get it or not.  Microsoft then evidently installed GWXConfigManager.exe which is evidently a program that will make sure my computer is ready for Windows 10.</p>
<p>That’d be fine with me if the program didn’t take up nearly a quarter of my CPU usage and it’s been going for nearly a week now.  Anyone know how to stop this?  I still would like to possibly upgrade to Windows 10 when it comes out, but I can’t take having  essentially one core of my quad core devoted JUST FOR THAT.</p>
<p>Thanks, everyone!</p>

            <p>The BMS rocket aerodynamics are spiffy and all, but nostalgia’s hitting me and now I wanna implement HL1’s style of RPG flight - where it couldn’t turn on a dime and behaved somewhat more like a real missile, is there any way to do this or is it built right into the game, à la the MP5’s burst fire? (If there was a way to make it single shot only, I will give a thousand cookies, chocolate chip)</p>
<p>EDIT: This seemed to be the most appropriate forum to post this in, at least to me, feel free to move if there’s a more appropriate forum</p>
