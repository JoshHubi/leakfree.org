            <p>I’m thinking about buying a new monitor. The main use is gaming. I currently have an ASUS ROG Swift PG278Q. It’s great, and there’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s a TN panel, and I hear the siren call of IPS/VA panel monitors. I have a 2014 Retina MacBook Pro, which I understand has an IPS panel monitor, and the colors really are a lot better than my Swift.</p>
<p>However, last time I bought a monitor, I tried out several IPS monitors first, and they all had this horrible “IPS glow” problem that’s a dealbreaker for me:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg0DlTbB0Vw" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg0DlTbB0Vw</a></p>
<p>Have current-gen IPS monitors moved past this, or are they still all bad? Do curved IPS monitors have less of a problem with this in anyone’s experience?</p>
<p>How about VA panels? I hear they have great contrast and that their colors are better than TN (but not as good as IPS), but that they have bad ghosting and smear problems, especially in darker scenes. They’re really hard to find, too. Not many manufacturers are making VA panel monitors.</p>
<p>Here are my other requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>1440p</li>
<li>144Hz</li>
<li>27"</li>
<li>G-Sync</li>
</ul>
<p>That narrows the field a lot. There are a few IPS monitors available with those specs, but no VA panel monitors that I could find. Anyone have recommendations?</p>

            <p>TL/DR… It starts slow, but ramps up, outstanding production values, graphics are great. Take the time to test and tweak the settings before you really dive in, its made a huge difference. Lighting, gameplay, audio, all great. Couple of Ui elements take a little time to learn. Story is so so, but when you go to an amusement park, its not about the story, its about the ride. Plenty of WOW moments so far.</p>
<p>Just about 4 hours in and I LOVE IT. It had kind of a slow start and I was a little worried about that. Let me tell you, Its a hell of a lot of fun. Optimization, do it. Get your settings dialed in, this has made a huuuuuge difference. I have a fairly strong rig, Right off the get go, I was disappointed with the graphics, I couldnt figure out why, I had everything maxed and it didnt look as sharp as it should. Next stop was Nvidia Control panel. I threw all the bells and whistles at it that i could, one setting that made a HUUUUUGE DIFFERENCE is MFAA in the Nvidia Control Panel, it sharpened everything up to where it should be. I had a go at 4k resolution, just to see, we aren’t there yet. Took a look at 2k, then back to 1080p.</p>
<p>1080p looks OUSTANDING. With everything enabled, Nv Control panel tweaked. It is quite something to behold. It maxes out my GPU at 98%, that is without OverClocking. I’m running a 2080TI Duke with an 8700k OC’d to 5.0. Animations are fluid, frame rates are great, I also enabled VSYNC and it works great. I’ve had no problems with tearing. I’m a little bit older, my eyes can get tired easily, so i’m quite thrilled with the fluidity of the graphics. Not a frame drop in site. I have been exploring a bit and there is plenty to see.</p>
<p>Let me say, the first big mission, Flushing the muties for the grizzly adams lookin fellow, thats when I knew, this game kicks​:heart:<img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"><img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=9" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:"> I’ve noticed a lot of people mention the pink, the pink is not overwhelming in game, however, when you hit the overdrive, its a tad more pink than I would like. Colors are very vibrant. They ease you into it. During the Flushing mission, the lighting was something else, best I have seen to date. Very very bright, so bright in parts that i had to look away for a minute, the lighting alone should have its own review. The fog effects are outstanding, I’ve noticed others say no HDR was disappointing. Honestly, I dont think you need it, as when the colors show, they really pop. You would likely have to wear sunglasses and sunblock if this was pumping HDR at you.</p>
<p>The story is nothing special, so far, I will update more as i progress through the game. As of now its your standard fair for post apocalyptic carnage. Not a whole lot of variety in enemy types as of yet, you have your mutants, and punks that really like hair dye, then there is the strogg like authority. Bosses so far have been fun, I’m still in the first 3rd of the game though.</p>
<p>The sound is good, and the movement is really a lot of fun when you get he hang of it. Lots of upgrades to keep you busy and lots of vehicles, a surprising amount of different vehicles really. Lots of upgrades for your weapons and vehicles. I mean A LOT. All of the different upgrades really spread it around, so many different techniques to build up. There is also a bit of a learning curve for the mission ui, navigating the map and such took a little getting use to.</p>
<p>Gameplay? Has it in spades. If you are looking for fast and furious combat, its there. Again, I was somewhat worried at the beginning of the game, that I had expected too much, the graphics were underwhelming and the gameplay was slow. After a little time spent in game wading into the good stuff. There is a constant stream of HOLY S@<span class="hashtag">#T</span> moments. The first vehicle I stole I didnt notice any guns on it or anything, so i pushed the fire button to see if anything happened. Yup, it sure did, several times i have been genuinely surprised and quite giddy with what has been unfolding before me. The production value is top notch, I have zero complaints with the price of admission. Not to mention the plan is for this game to receive a lot of TLC after launch. Which I’m already excited for. Cant wait to see what is next, will update review as game progresses. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. Take the time to dial in your settings and you wont be disappointed. I mean, thats what having a pc is for right?</p>

            <p>Titanfall 2 being one of the all time great fps games that was sadly set up for failure is still alive somewhat, I still play it. But now… Respawn has given us Apex Legends.  It’s free and if you havent checked it out, you NEED TO. Right so I’m on frequently but I’m getting a little tired of the hit and miss teammates. I dont care if we all suck,but trying to get on the same page as a team would be most welcomed. If there is anyone wanting to team up, (its 3 man squads) I’m available 24/7.  I have comms as well, but using the ping system is great too. So if anyone is wanting to play as a team, hit me up. nothing serious like tournaments, just having a good time playing with a small group that will work together. Hit me up on here or on origin or on steam under drgibbles</p>

            <p>Games, my secondary monitor, and other GPU-using applications show very intrusive artifacts that look like distorted parts of the displayed geometry rapidly changing position. These will show up on screenshots, such as this example from Black Mesa, although the fixed nature of the screenshots doesn’t do justice to the headache-inducing flickering that is produced:</p>
<p><a href="https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/947347364973609087/071164E9CBA62C3AA4BBE5020F9AFB7AA019DA58/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/947347364973609087/071164E9CBA62C3AA4BBE5020F9AFB7AA019DA58/</a></p>
<p>Observed minor versions of this once and a while over the last few weeks, but it has progressed to the point where games are unplayable just in the last day or so. At this point anomalies also began appearing on my second display, and could be observed in the ‘control center’ preview window. The preview actually displays normally until I attempt to run something graphics-intensive, at which point anomalies appear and remain until a few minutes after the graphics-intensive application is stopped.</p>
<p>Noticed that Minecraft, which runs based on OpenGL, works perfectly and all the games I have been having trouble with use DirectX. Possibly this is then a DirectX issue? Windows and my graphics driver (Nvidia GTX 1060 embedded) are up to date.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I was wondering if, by modifying the Source engine to add new effects, the option of adding a PBR system to Black Mesa has been considered.</p>
<p>I had this doubt to see that the team that is developing Boreal Alyph, has managed to successfully integrate a PBR to the engine.</p>
<p>The same can apply to BM or could saturate your customized version of the engine?</p>

          <title>Screen issues? Terrible luck? Or am I going mad/blind?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Admiral_Sakai]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Technology and Gaming</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, my last laptop (roughly 4 years old) had what I thought was just a somewhat defective monitor- even at 100% brightness, it was very dim (so dim I had trouble seeing where, for instance, the Steam window borders ended and my black desktop began), had low saturation for colors, and had a green tint to it. I fiddled with the Windows monitor calibration settings and got it looking sort of OK by boosting the gamma up really high and turning down the green color; eventually I physically replaced the screen due to unrelated damage (see below) and that was both a little brighter and had what I thought was a more normal color balance; however I still had to turn up the gamma very high to match the screen on my previous laptop.</p>
<p>Fast forward to this winter and I’ve upgraded to an Asus FX705G… and, much to my surprise, the screen is <em>also</em> extremely dim and has very low saturation with a slight greenish tint! I suppose it’s possible that the specific model of laptop I had before had some kind of general defect with the type of screen used, but that same defect appearing in a completely different model from a completely different manufacturer strains my credulity. These aren’t exactly low-end laptops (although since I work in an engineering department where the laptop must be carted around near a bunch of heavy and/or sharp equipment I kind of prioritize durability and portability over performance, hence the above issue with damage) so I don’t think the screens are somehow all of inferior quality… has anyone else experienced issues like this over the last few years?</p>
<p>I can’t exactly take screenshots of the effect since it is confined to this monitor and not the RGB values of the images displayed; external monitors or television sets connected to the computer show a more normal image (but I don’t have one on hand with factory default settings so it’s possible I upped the saturation on the available ones a long time ago). I am wondering if this has something to do with the Windows 10 features for color calibration since those were introduced at about the same time I began having these problems, but if that was the case it’d affect TV screens as well… wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>This is a particular problem for me because even with the inbuilt gamma settings turned up to maximum Black Mesa looks very dark and undersaturated- I can change the lower-level graphics settings in the console to compensate, but I can’t do lighting for my maps properly when I have no idea if what I’m looking at has any relation to what someone with a “normal” monitor would be seeing.</p>

          <title>Recommended games from 2012 to 2018</title>

            <p>Hi there everyone!<br>
I finally went ahead and bought a new laptop, because my Dell Inspirion from 2012 is finally falling apart. I was on a tight budget and while I have a reasonable interest in gaming, I had some other personally important criteria (light weight, good CPU, neat design, reasonable battery life, decent 144hz screen, ethernet jack, SSD harddisk) for the machine. So I think I found my personal best compromise in the Lenovo Legion y530. this one comes with an GTX 1050ti. Not too bad for a laptop around that price tag, but that’s a GPU which will be outdated kinda soon.</p>
<p>This is why I resorted to concentrate on games from the timeperiod between 2012 and 2018, covering roughly a period in which I wasn’t able to play many games dur to a weak GPU. There are a couple of games on my list that I will want to play from this time period. Those are the following:</p>
<p>XCOM 2<br>
Fallout 4<br>
Dark Souls 2 +3<br>
Bioshock 1-3<br>
The Witcher 2 &amp; 3<br>
Superhot<br>
thimbleweed Park<br>
Mutant Year Zero<br>
Far Cry 4 + 5<br>
(Maybe) Sudden Strike 4</p>
<p>Well, there are others but I guess these would be the ones on the top of my list. Those will amount to quite some hours of gameplay, but remember I’ll be keeping my laptop a couple of years before buying a new one.</p>
<p>So my questions to you is: Which game from the last 6 years (or more) is a MUST-Play in your opinion, that need to be added to the list? I’m really curious what your opinions are! Thanks!</p>

          <title>Some questions on upgrading a free computer I got</title>

          <category>Technology and Gaming</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I recently was gifted a really low spec computer from a friend who said he didn’t need it anymore. I’m somewhat savvy, but I know a lot more of you guys are even more savvy and would be able to help me in upgrading this computer as much as I can for as little money as possible. Below are the specs for the computer in its current state.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64bit</p>
<p>Processor: AMD FX-6300 6 Core 3.5GHz</p>
<p>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 1GB Dedicated Graphics Card</p>
<p>Ram: 8GB’s DDR3</p>
<p>Storage: 128 GB SSD (this I have enough common sense to know will need expanded greatly)</p>
<p>I know it’s kinda shitty, but it was free. I’m hoping for input on how to make it pretty reasonably good without breaking the bank. I’m looking to spend maybe around 600 or so at most, but I’m willing to be flexible on that and go more if needed. Like I said, I know a little bit but I’m not genius with computers. If anyone has any ideas, hit me with them. If there’s anything you need to know, I’ll add it if I forgot it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <title>Mash two or three game titles together. What do you get?</title>

            <p>Take two or three game titles and mash them together without losing any of the words or changing their position, then describe what this new game is about.</p>
<p>They have to play off each other. Don’t just mash game titles that have no words in common. For example: Grand Theft Auto + Auto Modellista = Grand Theft Auto Modellista.</p>
<p>I’ll start:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Half-Life is Strange</span> - After a scientific experiment goes catastrophic, a young female scientist called Max Caulfield must struggle to fight off dangerous creatures from another dimension while dealing with her problematic childhood friend Chloe Price.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Perfect Dark Souls</span> - Joanna Dark must use her extensive arsenal of futuristic weapons and gadgets to survive in the world of Lordran and rekindle the fire.</p>

          <title>Does anyone else feel like the Artifact card game might be a joke?</title>

            <p>I don’t know, with the resources that Valve has, I think its a little odd that they would announce it, but have zero screen shots or really anything other than a title and an image.   They have the vive now, the piece they released before as a demo, the lab, I refuse to believe that they would focus on a card game with that kind of tech available.  They are trying to launch the steam box and vr, I don’t think a card game will help move hardware, Imo.  I also follow one of their devs regularly, he has a site set up with info about whats going on and just general interesting things, and he seems to have gone radio silent for more than 2 months now.   Its just fishy.  There are 2 movies in the works, Portal and Half-life, that still haven’t been properly announced.  Then a half gig update today for portal 2?  Stuff for the sdk and to help with mappers, just seemed like a big update for just that, it also updated all the songs on the portal2 soundtrack which I find a little weird.  Anyone else have thoughts on the latest from valve?</p>

<p>That opening shot reminded me so much of Xen’s environment. Then it got a bit darker in a monochromatic, Quake sort of way. In all honestly, I’m in love. (With the art direction/design, not necessarily the gameplay.)</p>

<p>Have they dispersed and all of them playing different games now?</p>
<p>Most of the mods i play now aren’t really as active as it was in the good ol’ days, like 2-3 servers with 2-5 players.</p>

          <title>Headset recommendations?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So my current headset just kinda broke, one of the ears just kinda broke off. So I’m looking for good headset suggestions.<br>
My current headset is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LOGITECH-G430-DTS-Headphone-981-000536/dp/B00CQ35C1Q" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Logitech G430</a>, it has both USB and 3.5mm connection options, but I had a lot of trouble with the USB adapter.</p>
<p>So, does anyone know a similar headset of equal or greater quality, in that $40 price range? Worse comes to worst I’ll just get a new one of these, but I know there has to be better out there.<br>
I’d prefer something similarly built, over-the-ear with cable controls for volume and microphone muting. I don’t need the 7.1 surround sound, considering I never use it anyway (too many issues with out-of-game use), but obviously stereo is a must. I don’t even think non-stereo headsets are made anymore come to think of it. No real preference over USB or 3.5mm either.</p>
<p>I know with all these specifications it seems like I should just get another G430, but honestly, this thing was a pain in the ass when I first got it, and it still can be on occasion.  Plus it’s healthy to broaden my headset range, y’know?</p>
<p>EDIT: There’s only a few bucks difference, but I’ve heard that the only difference between the G230 and G430 is the USB surround adapter. If this is true, that could also be an option for me, but I’d like a few second opinions first.</p>
