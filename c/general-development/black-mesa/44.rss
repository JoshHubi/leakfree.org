          <title>Does anyone have the VMFs for the Xen levels?</title>

            <p>Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I’m not sure where else to ask. I’m trying to make a mod and I need the VMFs for every level of the game. I have the earthbound levels (someone had them up for download), but I can’t find the Xen ones. I would decompile them myself but I haven’t been able to get BSPSource working for some reason (will try fighting with it more later if I have to), and I even tried rolling back to the public beta version to get the VMFs but I can’t seem to find them.</p>
<p>Like I said, someone had put up the earthbound levels files in a repository online, so I was wondering if anyone might know where I could get the ones for the Xen levels. Whether that’s a direct download of the VMFs, or tips on how to find the files, I don’t care.</p>

          <title>Help me finish my first-ever sound mod (Sound.cache problem?)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[TheLostSkeleton]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I’m not a total newbie; I’ve been doing some form of game development since 1998, but I’ve never done tons of Source modding before so I don’t understand the finer details.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten as far as generating a VPK for my sound mod. That local VPK works in Black Mesa just fine, but when I feed it through the Publishing Tool and try to subscribe to my own mod, suddenly it stops working and the console gets flooded with error messages like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannot figure out which search path sound\npc\alien_slave\vort_bm_alert01.wav came from.  Absolute path is D:\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\362890\1969844684\Classic Alien Slave Voice.vpk\sound\npc\alien_slave\vort_bm_alert01.wav<br>
Failed to load sound</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Searching these forums suggests I might need to build a soundcache to include with my VPK. Black Mesa seems to automatically generate a soundcache for my VPK after loading it the first time, so I point the Publishing Tool at the folder with the VPK + sound.cache file, but, again, the console is flooded with search path errors when it comes back down off the workshop.</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.blackmesasource.com/t/custom-audio-not-playing-in-workshop-ugc/15329" rel="nofollow noopener">Another thread from two years ago</a> mentions a console command called “snd_buildcache”. So, instead of using the sound.cache file generated for my VPK, I copy all of my sound files in the proper folder structure in to bms and build a cache.</p>
<p>This leaves me with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bms\aslave\sound.cache (664kb)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which was built from</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bms\aslave\sound\npc\alien_slave\ (62 files, 11.7mb)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I repack my VPK, publish it, and yet again, it’s the same story: the local VPK I generated works fine for me, but trying to pull it off the workshop doesn’t work because it’s yelling about search path errors.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>For reference, here’s my VPK: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RGveUu4_udRaPQTaqYW5wAf6Txk0JSSn" rel="nofollow noopener">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RGveUu4_udRaPQTaqYW5wAf6Txk0JSSn</a></p>

          <title>Black Mesa Sound Effects Copyright Question</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[The_Sink_God]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi. I noticed a thread on this forum mentioning that most of the sound effects in the game (bms_sounds_misc) were royalty free and that the license.txt mentioned a CC BY-NC license. I just wanted to clarify since my project is a bit different than the one mentioned in the post:<br>
I’m working on a project that involves making an underground facility in UE4, that would be controllable by users. They could run “experiments”, operate shipments, security, etc and control the facility’s systems. I wanted to use some sounds from the black mesa files since they fit in perfectly. The game will be free to use, <em>but I will accept donations</em> if the user chooses to (this is all considering the project comes through with anything - it’s very early in development).<br>
My question is, am I okay to use some sound effects from the game files under this, would I need to not accept donations at all, am I not allowed to use the sound effects, etc?</p>

            <p>no clue where to post stuff yet.<br>
So I’m new to these forums though I’ve been following Back Mesa since before it’s Steam release and I’m getting more comfortable with Hammer but I’ve also been working on Making things for Doom as well and I had a thought of using sound effects from BMS in a custom Doom map but I hate the idea of stepping on toes and I’m still learning these forums, I couldn’t find a simple answer but could I use the BMS sfx in my project or is that a big no no.</p>
<p>Sorry if this was put in the wrong topic.</p>

          <title>Are there any plans/support for the multiplayer/coop mode?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Roald]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello I am new to this community and not that much familair with half-life.<br>
I am more known to counter strike and the overlapping mapping tool Hammer SDK.<br>
So I was wondering what the multiplayer gamemode looks like and what are the plans?<br>
What gamemodes are there to play? and would there be room for fresh new gamemodes?<br>
Remembering HL I can only remember (team) deathmatch is that true?<br>
Are there any tutorials on how to implent existing (and new) gamemodes?</p>
<p>I was thinking about some kind of coop survival mode where you fight waves of Xenian bots with 1/2/3 other players. Each wave will increase the ammount of bots and add new/better Xenians. You will gain money on killing them that allows you to buy weapons and equipment troughout the map (and perhaps open new doors/rooms). The gamemode will contain a leaderboard that shows a ranking of highest wave you reached and perhaps highest ammount of kills/exp or money you gained.<br>
I am not into scripting so is there like a support thing for this or people who are interesting on working on something like this? Is there also a way to playtest your map?</p>
<p>EDIT: here a idea I worked out and its like the CoD Black Ops zombie mode:<br>

<p>The map will consist of different areas and each area I gave a color. You will start at the pink area in the tram (with breakable windows and perhaps if possible edit the model so there is a shutter in the ceiling). The tram will make it’s way on the train track as far as possible. You will have to spend money on opening new gates and doors to reach a new area for the tram to move. Some areas are more expensive then others because of some factors like the size of the area and the equipment that can be found there. When you open one door of one area, all the doors and gates of that area open simultaneously. So you buy the area, not the specific door. The tram track is attached to the colors in the order: pink/blue/red/purple. If you open all areas the train will go in circles arround the map.</p>
<p>So the Xenians will spawn in waves. Each higher wave bring in more and better xenians. The Xenians will spawn in non playable area from where they can enter the map. When a new area gets opened also new spawnpoints will be triggered. I am not sure how these bots would react on a moving tram… would they be smart enough to jump on it or crawl trough the windows? Perhaps instead of the tram it got to become some kind of platform.</p>
<p>Troughout the map there will be standard buy spots with certain equipment and weapons (pistols, smg, shotguns, grenades, health, ammo boxes and etc). Also there will be special boxes that give a random weapon which can be a special weapon and cost more.</p>
<p>Instead of COOP it can also be Multiplayer with a few survivors and others are Xenians and they have like ‘x’ tickets each wave OR 50/50 and when a player dies he joins the Xenians. When the Xenians tickets run out they lose or when all survivors are dead.</p>

          <title>Document Generation Tutorial</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Admiral_Sakai]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Several people have asked how I am making the documents that I have been using in pre-disaster chapters, so I thought I’d put together a quick tutorial on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Software Needed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">LibreOffice</a> with the ‘Draw’ component, or any similar word processor with vector drawing functionality. A PhD student where I work uses PowerPoint for this. This tutorial assumes basic familiarity with the functionality of these types of programs.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">GIMP</a>. If you have Photoshop or another relatively heavy-duty image editing tool that will also work but GIMP is free. This tutorial assumes familiarity with common image-manipulation functions in these sort of programs</li>
<li>
<a href="https://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=41" rel="nofollow noopener">VTFEdit</a>. Having some knowledge of Source engine material creation will be helpful.</li>
<li>The Black Mesa release of the Hammer editor (duh).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Making Paper Documents</strong><br>
This is typically best done in Draw, with text boxes. If you want you can compose the actual text in the standard word processor and paste it over, but the next step requires copying and pasting the resulting document into GIMP and only the drawing editors can typically do that.<br>

Stuff like the Black Mesa logo and paper formats (technical reports, memos, etc) I tend to copy from other documents to try to keep it consistent. The source documents I use are stored in the VPKs of the pre-disaster mods in case other people want access to them for this purpose.</p>
<p>One thing I find useful is designing the entire document at twice the size it would actually be IRL- for instance instead of an 8.5 x 11 page with 12-point font I use a 17 x 22 page with 24-point font. This makes the resulting image crisper because of how Source handles texture resolutions (see below).</p>
<p>Figures and graphs are typically things I find by typing a few terms vaguely related to the topic of the document into Google Images or Google Scholar. It can have a white or transparent background, either one works. Most of the handwritten annotations on documents are just another text box with a ‘handwritten’ font; anything more complicated than that is a subject we’ll get to later on.</p>
<p><strong>Processing Typed Documents In GIMP</strong><br>
Once you have your document looking the way you want it, you’ll want to have ready a blank paper texture in GIMP. You could just use a flat white rectangle, but actual paper does have some texture to it so I use a file called paper_big.tga that I got off of Google Images and keep in the ‘materialsrc’ folder of the VPKs. There are also a couple of different notebook and graph papers in there, and you can find other paper backgrounds online.<br>
Whatever you use, it’s a good idea to make sure it’s sized at or a little under a power of 2 (1024, 2048, 4096, etc) along its long axis- I’ll explain why in a later section.</p>
<p>Hit Ctrl-A to select the entire page area in your drawing processor and paste it into GIMP. This will produce a new layer with your text converted to an image- you may need to move and resize it to match the dimensions of the paper, although obviously blowing it up too large will make the image blurry.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58" title="image"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58_2_690x373.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="alrFL6O7ORWkYK64tvugYEV33fO" width="690" height="373" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58_2_690x373.png, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58_2_1035x559.png 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58_2_1380x746.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/4/48825c3d31c6aec2de3a8d268b1c63df7ef44b58_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1919×1040 638 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
Finally, you will want to run the ‘color to alpha’ filter with white selected as the alpha color. This will get rid of any white backgrounds on figures or drawings for you, but it will also allow a little bit of the paper background to show through in areas that were not perfectly black. This goes a long way to making it look as though the text is actually printed onto the background instead of just floating artificially above it.</p>
<p>This is also the step where you can add things like highlighting and redaction using the ‘brush’ tool. The ‘multiply’ setting is good for highlighting because it will affect the white paper but not black print.</p>
<p><strong>Using Preexisting Documents</strong><br>
Some things like equipment manuals, safety posters, and non-BM technical papers I just looked up on the Internet. GIMP has a very useful feature that allows you to import one or more pages from a PDF as an image file. Those typically have white backgrounds, so I just run the color-to-alpha filter on them and put an appropriate background behind them.</p>
<p><strong>Using Hand-Drawn Figures</strong><br>
My preferred method of generating hand-drawn figures or doodles is to take them off of IRL sources. I work at a research university so there are tons of whiteboards and notebooks just lying around with random scientific scribblings for me to photograph; another good place to get materials like this is from YouTube where professors will often post videos of their lectures that you can take screenshots of; sometimes you can also find drawings of things just through Google Images but I’d recommend looking at YouTube first. I suppose you could just draw and annotate diagrams yourself and photograph them, but I’d worry that all of these documents supposedly by different people would come out all in the same style and all with the same handwriting.</p>
<p>Regardless of source, typically what you get is a photo of a whiteboard, chalkboard, or piece of paper with stuff drawn on it.<br>

We will want to use “color to alpha” again to extract the figure, but to do that we want the background to be perfectly white and not the mix of light grays it is at the start. This can be achieved by using the ‘Levels’ tool to shift the white threshold of the image but not the black. Sometimes you may need to make multiple passes to get rid of all color in the background without washing out the figure itself:<br>

For drawings on chalkboards you may want to invert the colors to produce a dark drawing on a pale background.</p>
<p>Basic things like scribbles, underlines, or circles can generally be found on Google Images.</p>
<p><strong>Making Emails &amp; Other Computer Records</strong><br>
I typically start with a ‘blank’ version of a common program like Outlook or Word. These can be made pretty simply just by finding a screenshot of the program on an older version of Windows and whiting out the text fields. If you wanted to be fancy I suppose you could set up your computer with a retro Windows theme and take screenshots off of that. Either way, I typically just edit the ‘blank’ versions directly in GIMP to add my own text; for things like PowerPoint slides I copy stuff from Draw.<br>

I’ve found that 11-point Tahoma with anti-aliasing disabled very well approximates the system font on old versions of Windows.</p>
<p>There’s blank versions of each of the programs I’ve used in the relevant pre-disaster VPK files.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Terminal’ Screen Effect</strong><br>
Sometimes for older displays or ones that aren’t a full computer monitor, I’ve added a striated glow effect. This works best on diagrams that are predominantly a black background with light-colored shapes- the ‘invert’ filter in GIMP can be very helpful in this regard.</p>
<p>The actual filter is a four-step process: first, I add the 'Distorts &gt; Video" filter to create the scan lines effect; then, I decompose the image into R, G, and B layers; then, <em>for each layer</em>, I run the ‘artistic &gt; softglow’ filter; and finally recompose the image. This is necessary because if the softglow filter is applied to a full RGB image it just makes the glow white and not the color of what is glowing.</p>
<p><strong>Final Preparation Of Document Textures</strong><br>
The first thing you will want to do once a document is concocted to your satisfaction is to adjust it so that no part of it is exactly 0-0-0 black. This is because the later Source visual effect will use an RGB value of 0 0 0 to decide <em>not</em> to render portions of the image- this will cause portions of your document which are exactly black to render as ‘holes’ through which the background can be seen. Setting the dark output level in the ‘levels’ tool to 5 is a good way to remove any actual black areas without visibly altering the image:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d3f57255f0f74acb8decc0ac449632cfa0136018.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/d3f57255f0f74acb8decc0ac449632cfa0136018" title="image"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d3f57255f0f74acb8decc0ac449632cfa0136018.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uf4C1g8JOwO1fmls09f0nlbfRJ6" width="320" height="500" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d3f57255f0f74acb8decc0ac449632cfa0136018_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">373×581 13.8 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Next, make sure the image is scaled properly. Source Engine textures must be a power of 2 along each axis (although it needn’t be the <em>same</em> power of 2, i.e. the image can be a rectangle and not a square), but while it’s good practice to fill as much of the available space in the image as possible the actual document need not take up <em>all</em> of it. Since some images (like computer outputs) are supposed to be a specific pixel-for-pixel representation of something and even those that aren’t can lose resolution when resized, you may want to scale the <em>canvas</em> to a power of 2 without affecting the image.</p>
<p>Export the image to some sort of lossless format, import it into VTFEdit, and save it as a VTF file somewhere in your materials directory. Make a corresponding VMT with the following information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LightmappedGeneric<br>
{<br>
“$basetexture”	“path/to/vtf”<br>
$selfillum 1<br>
$selfillumtint “[.75 .75 .75]”<br>
}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The $selfillumtint parameter determines how bright your document will look and is influenced by your tonemap settings. Generally you don’t want them looking dark gray, but at the same time you don’t want them to be at full brightness because then under most tonemap settings there will be heavy bloom that obscures the text.</p>
<p><strong>Displaying The Document In Hammer</strong><br>
The apparatus for displaying a document consists of three parts.</p>
<p>The first is the document itself, which is kept outside the main play area of the map with a point_camera pointed at it. I typically put mine all in a row in a single location, but they can really go anywhere.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9.png" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9" title="image"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9_2_690x373.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="uV5BwPcmlYfg41aWdoY4QOkHXWV" width="690" height="373" srcset="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9_2_690x373.png, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9_2_1035x559.png 1.5x, https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9_2_1380x746.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/d/d8b5515e74673dfc39968fa92a58c6bc21c121d9_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1920×1038 290 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
The size of the document texture in Hammer doesn’t actually matter because Source maintains the original image resolution regardless of the texture scale- a texture will look just as crisp if it is on a large brush the player is far away from as it will on a small brush the player is close to. This is true for the camera entity as well. A document that takes up a little less than a 32-by-32 brush with the camera ~16 units away will typically be well-positioned to fill the screen. The brush behind the transparent document should be black. The camera doesn’t need any special properties other than a unique name.</p>
<p>The second component is a collection of player behavior and view-management entities. These include a logic_auto with the output</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OnMapSpawn &lt;NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT_INTRO&gt; SetBlendMode 5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a game_ui ent with the output</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PlayerOff &lt;NAME OF THE FUNC_BUTTON BELOW&gt; PressOut</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the ‘Freeze Player’, ‘Hide Weapon’, ‘+Use Deactivates’, and ‘Jump Deactivates’ flags all set, and a script_intro entity which can be named anything. You only need one of these sets per map.</p>
<p>Finally, each document you want to view needs a func_button entity with the “Use Activates”, “Toggle”, and “Don’t Move” flags set and the outputs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OnIn &lt;NAME OF  YOUR SCRIPT_INTRO&gt; SetCameraViewEntity &lt;NAME OF THE CAMERA THAT SHOWS YOUR DOCUMENT&gt;<br>
OnIn &lt;NAME OF YOUR FUNC_UI&gt; Activate<br>
OnIn &lt;NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT_INTRO&gt; Activate 0.01<br>
OnOut &lt;NAME OF YOUR FUNC_UI&gt; Deactivate<br>
OnOut &lt;NAME OF YOUR SCRIPT_INTRO&gt; Deactivate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is most convenient for all of your buttons to have the same target name.<br>
I made a small custom sprite to make the buttons visible, but this has no effect on their logic. The sprite texture is called documents/docflag_sprite.vmt and is available in any Pre-Disaster VPK.</p>

          <title>Opposing Force Style HECU</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I am currently working on some HECU models in the style of Opposing Force, mostly for use in SFM but I’d like to bring them over into Black Mesa. But I have a question regarding how the bodygroups/skingroups work for this game and how to setup the .qc in a way that tells the game to use a variety of bodygroups and skingroups instead of the same ones over and over. If perhaps there are other qc lines required instead of just the $bodygroup ones. Gmod has a method using lua but I’m not sure how Black Mesa handles it. I apologize if this isn’t the right place to ask this.</p>
<p>Can anybody shed some light on this?</p>

          <title>A better look for this game</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[24Seg]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The intention of this post, is to give my opinion and ideas maybe already thought, about things that should have happened but they did not happen, this are changes that would make this title more enjoyable, i hope they can be heard someday, i would like you to say with constructive criticism.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>if they can add (because it is possible) animations such as “Use” for (doors / buttons) animation like turn on/off the flashlight, inspect weapon, add “procedural bones” for the (fps look) that would improve the look (up / down) and the ( walk/run) add this without affect the current animations (sprint) and add a (fps body) which would add many layers of immersion to the game, not realism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Side Note; these changes are things that can take from left 4 dead, such as (npc bloodpool) and (blood in hands and weapons).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<ul>
<li>add some graphic effects, such as (d-light) when shooting, (smoke) when shooting, and sprites that are generated when walking in water, such as left 4 dead 1, also improve the particles from the beginning I never liked them, they are small and realistic “that was not necessary” it would be better if the bullet impact were something more exaggerated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Side Note; I do not mean so exaggerated, i want to say more striking, shocking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<ul>
<li>The mapping is good, well optimized and well taken, the problem is in the lack of sense in many situations that I find, such as ghost doors, poorly made walls, and poor transition between sectors, as an example ( Sector C &amp; B ) what separates them is a door in a warehouse, “a disappointment for me” I expected the sectors to be independent from each other and what connected them were designated areas for that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Side Note; This is good because it could add more content to the game without needing to manage things that do not fit.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I imagined that each sector should be isolated from one of the others, that an example the sector to enter has to go through 2 (blastdoor) I assumed that to exit also by a (blastdoor) or similar that would connect with an area for the introduction of material or personnel that was not civil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that had about these areas, should have the function (of point of control, point of supply, pumping, water and other elements, electricity, ventilation, insertion of non-civilian personnel, transport security guards, workers and etc), and their use of these would have certain restrictions according to the authorization levels across the sectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<ul>
<li>They should create or add a scatter system and recoil, for weapons, (not for realism purposes) only for good gameplay purposes, a system that has (recoil &amp; dispersion) based on the movements that we use, because in general the weapons feel strange, without a job behind, only simple weapons with damage and random, so they would also achieve a unique feeling (by weapon) and it does not have to be a system that impacts a lot, it is not needed so much because it is a game single-player</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Side Note; just a little (scatter &amp; recoil) for weapons does not even have to be much, the most important thing is what is seen moves the aim based on the movement as in the csgo.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<ul>
<li>They should rework the enemies in the game because it feels bad to play them, from the beginning I never liked the (bullsquid), (zombies), (vortigaunts), especially I never like the zombies in the series of Half Life, there are to give them a turn to make them more dangerous, I will tell them how I would have liked those enemies to be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bullsquid, they are intelligent animals, they should lurk, but when you leave their field of vision “they are deactivated”, they should follow you, in addition to attacking body to body, spitting and make a charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vortigaunt, they should be more defensive always hidding, because they are more intelligent, apart they should having a faster reaction for the attack time “they are very slow and weak”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zombies, i would have liked the (zombies) from the beginning, were dressed with all personal skins (guards, scientist, workers), and not have a recognizable head model, and also that followed the pattern of (poison zombies) that had many (headcrabs) in his body and In addition to throwing, also that throw things, and when more headcrabs have more stronger is, also can walk and run like (zombine).<br>
Side Note; not every single zombie have to be like that, but with this we have variety, (no only in models also in difficulty), and diversion of the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<ul>
<li>You must add the construction workers, machinists, electricians (they can create a model and change the tone of the suit to deduce in what zone it works, blue as an electrician) office employees, administrators (because each zone has to have a boss ), and people with a hazmat suit because there are areas where we go through machinery that contains radiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Should return the variants of the (headcrabs) and the zombies of their respective classes, because they already existed in xen and are evolutions or subspecies of them, also should add the (antlions) to xen, even in inaccessible areas, just to have them of decoration would be a detail of the which you would be congratulated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>8.- the arsenal, all weapons should have a secondary trigger, with an alternative animation and all weapons (except the hornetgun, and throwables) should have an animation to recharge following the logic of weapons clear, also should remove the shared ammunition of weapons.<br>
Side Note; All those weapons changes that I propose are good ideas of how it should evolve in the future if you want, can add a difficulty that could be (classic that keeps things as they are).</p>
<p>Slot 1 - Crowbar, if the lever could be programmed to function as the melee weapons of (left 4 dead 2), in which sweep an area in front of the player, and not that point in the middle of the screen, also add a secondary attack, heavier.</p>
<p>Slot 2 - Pistol, it could be a glock model 20 - 10mm, 15 bullets, the secondary trigger causes it to fire a burst of 3 bullets.<br>
Side Note; the fire-rate would be the same in burst but you will be able to shoot 2 or 3 bullets per shoot.</p>
<p>Slot 2 - Magnum i no like the fact it is a python, el modelo que mas se parece es un S&amp;W m29 with 6 bullets, secondary trigger laser sight or who’s prefer a fast shoots.<br>
Side Note, for me, the iron sight is out of context, I prefer a new mechanic as a laser sight with better precision or on the secondary trigger shoot faster by hammering manually with the hand.</p>
<p>Slot 3 - Submachinegun, the mp5 that you developed is almost perfect, only lacks the animation of recharging the grenade launcher.<br>
Side Note; we should have the possibility to change it for an m4 with an m203 with its complete set of animations.</p>
<p>Slot 3 - Shotgun, the prefer model of SPAS-12C with a folding stock, and its secondary trigger should be switched to semi-automatic mode to semi-auto/pump-action.<br>
Side Note; this change will improve the way of play of the SPAS-12C, because you can select in the moments of accion, semi-auto, in the moments more slower can select to pump for no waste ammo.</p>
<p>Slot 3 - Crossbow - the crossbow is perfect, only that they should improve the optical sight in one way or another, or place an animated sprite, to optimize the performance impact it has.</p>
<p>Slot 4 - RPG, the problem with the (RPG) is that it feels weak and light, should not be so, also has a (fire-rate) very high, should be slower, cause more damage, and a larger radius of explosion, be more lethal.</p>
<p>Slot 4 - Gauss Gun; this weapon needs a total repair, it should be like a shotgun firing 5 times and then turning the cylinder (it will rotate the cylinder 3 times, 15 shots) then it runs out of ammunition, the secondary trigger turns the cylinder and you perform a concentrated shot while spending 5 shots in 1, and a recharge animation and one for the secondary trigger.</p>
<p>Slot 4 - Gluon Gun, i suggest that you should add it, a secondary trigger and a recharge animation, the secondary trigger would trigger a slightly wider wave of gluon that would be useful to fight against bosses.</p>
<p>Slot 4 - Hornet gun, remains intact.</p>
<p>Slot 5 - Granada, should create something similar to what did valve with its grenades of csgo, you can choose between medium, short and long throwing game with clicks, the rest of this weapon is well elaborated, except the animation what can be improved.</p>
<p>Slot 5 - Satchel, remains intact.</p>
<p>Slot 5 - Tripmine, remain intact.</p>
<p>Slot 5 - snark, the most significant change for this weapon would be that you could take the sack of snarks, and throw them when the sack hit the ground, they would jump from there 6 snark.</p>

          <title>&quot;Evacuation&quot; / &quot;Rescue&quot; Singleplayer Map Mode</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Admiral_Sakai]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve been tossing around for a little while now the idea of a type of singleplayer map where the objective is to hunt down as many friendly NPCs as possible in various locations throughout a map and bring them safely to an elevator, evac chopper, or other safe area. There’s levels somewhat like this in Half-Life and its expansions, but to my knowledge it has never been attempted in quite the same way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Office Complex in Half-Life/Black Mesa allows you to accumulate quite a number of friendly NPCs as you travel through the level, but they don’t really <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> anything once you get to the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Questionable Ethics requires the player to bring a scientist to the end of the level to open a door, but all the scientists are in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blue Shift’s Captive Freight has multiple scientists located throughout who then appear in later levels and evacuate the facility with you, but they automatically survive regardless of what the player does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decay has Domestic Violence where a security guard needs to be found and saved among many who are being threatened by enemies, but again only one is actually savable.<br>
A dedicated ‘evac’ map style would, I think, introduce a number of gameplay elements rarely found in standard HL/Black Mesa style levels:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Multiple Degrees Of Success</span>: I am thinking it will be possible to technically ‘complete’ the level in the sense of getting to the end of it with all or nearly all of the NPCs dead, but the number the player saved will explicitly be tallied at the end and possibly result in additional items/dialogue/whatever. I am thinking that not all NPCs will be placed equally, with some being very easy to find/save and some being very difficult- think of it like a Metroidvania or Zelda style gamewith optional items where there’s a concept of a completion percentage and a 100% run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">“Broad” Multi-Objective Gameplay</span>: While there are exceptions and a fair number of side areas to explore, typically HL/Black Mesa gameplay is fairly directional and linear. I am imagining that an evacuation map will have much less of a directional quality since NPCs can be found in many different places and recovered in different orders. At the same time, there is no reason <span class="bbcode-i">every</span> area has to be accessible from the start without completing some secondary objective elsewhere in the map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Defense of Fixed Positions Or Non-Player Objectives</span>: Escort missions are generally derided for a number of pretty good reasons, but used in moderation I think protecting NPCs from enemy attacks could be a tense, interesting element of gameplay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Time Pressure</span>: I don’t think having NPCs die at predetermined intervals while the player is doing something completely unrelated is necessarily <span class="bbcode-i">fair</span>, but once they are in sight of the player it would be fairly easy to create a variety of situations where said player has to think quickly to kill an enemy or de-activate an environmental hazard threatening them- from simple tasks on the order of a second or two to more complex tasks involving the environment which must be done within a relatively large number of minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Secondary Objectives to Make Areas Navigable</span>: Once the player has FOUND an NPC that may not be the end of interaction with them; the way the player <span class="bbcode-i">got</span> to them might not be usable as a way out, requiring additional player effort to secure a safe evacuation route.<br>
The big obstacle I see to this sort of map is that just using their native AI the Black Mesa NPCs are not particularly adept at navigating dangerous areas or moving around in large groups, and while Black Mesa typically works around this by keeping their actions heavily scripted the scripts are not then in turn moddable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this something people would be interested in playing?</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">Hello everyone![/size]</span></p>
<p>I would like to present to you my first project for Black Mesa Singleplayer - Power pit<br>
[/size]<br>
Plot[/size]</p>
<p>You need to launch a rocket with a satellite. For this, it is necessary to supply fuel, energy, oxygen to the rocket. You can launch a missile in the center of missile launch. You can get there only with the help of a scientist. You have to find a scientist and protect from monsters, soldiers and other machine guns. To help you come guard and together fighting off all the enemies and including oxygen and fuel, you must deliver the scientist to the launching center of missiles.</p>
<p>I attach a few screenshots. Early alpha, work in progress.See you   <img src="https://leakfree.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  [/size]</p>

            <p>In addition to the weapon bucket icons, I’ve been working on making ammo icons to match the models used in Juniez’ pack.<br>
<img alt=""></p>
<p>It’s going alright so far, but I’ve run into an issue that’s been bothering me. The generic ammo icons are used both for ammo counts and for pickups alike.<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3eK9hL3.png" alt="" width="161" height="81"><br>
In vanilla BM, this isn’t really an issue as they decided to use images of the ammo’s world models, meaning they’re all in boxes or canisters for the most part.</p>
<p>In short I’m trying to allow for the CHudItemPickup field to use separate vtf’s from CHudWeaponPrimaryAmmo and CHudWeaponSecondaryAmmo, where applicable. Problem being I can’t make heads or tails of source’s UI framework. Anyone think they could lend me a hand?</p>

          <title>Overlapping maps</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Brigid]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I managed to convert the maps of the free version into object files so I could stitch them together in Blender. I found out that a lot of the maps overlap each other. For instance, in the attached picture, the foreground is the warehouse in We’ve Got Hostiles. The lumpy blue thing running through the yard is one of the tram tunnels from Inbound.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce337d1fd562e1f9d2bc3a19be284c4f79bc4f6.jpeg" data-download-href="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/5ce337d1fd562e1f9d2bc3a19be284c4f79bc4f6" title="Black Mesa overlap.jpg"><img src="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/original/2X/5/5ce337d1fd562e1f9d2bc3a19be284c4f79bc4f6.jpeg" alt="Black Mesa overlap.jpg" data-base62-sha1="dfIJRq8OQe3Eg1Raovt1oATYRLM" width="690" height="500" data-small-upload="https://leakfree.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/5/5ce337d1fd562e1f9d2bc3a19be284c4f79bc4f6_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Black Mesa overlap.jpg</span><span class="informations">954×774 89.3 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
Now, maybe this has already been fixed for the paid version or maybe the developers don’t want to bother. Just thought I should bring it to someone’s attention. I thought of trying to rework the maps myself, but I haven’t a clue how to do that and I’d probably break something.</p>
<p>(For those wondering why I bothered importing the maps to Blender, I just wanted to build a map of the facility so I could fill in some of the gaps for my own story writing.)</p>

          <title>Remastering Xen for &quot;The Orange Suit Project&quot;</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Momocody]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Black Mesa</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For Episode Three, we plan to delve into the depths of Xen once again. This time, you can see all new types of flora and fauna.</p>
<p>Our modelers and artists have been hard at work making new types of plants and textures to enhance the Xen experience. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/unknown_1.png" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/unknown_1.png" alt="" width="690" height="453"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">831×546</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
This plant we call the Hkar’Ar. It is a custom plant specifically made for this mod. It resides in the dark and damp caverns of Xen and beats like a heart.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/light_plant.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="455"><br>
Returning to the mix is the Light Plant, which has been remodeled to hold up to today’s graphical standards.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/violet_crystal.jpg" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/violet_crystal.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="500"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">238×587</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
This is the Violet Crystal. This enemy has not been seen in a Half-Life game since the very first. It shoots lasers from it’s hanging bulb below. Watch out for it!</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/Untitled-2.png" title="" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://media.moddb.com/images/members/5/4089/4088975/profile/Untitled-2.png" alt="" width="500" height="500"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename"></span><span class="informations">1000×1000</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
This is a remastered texture from the original Half-Life 1 game. After reprocessing it using some questionable ethics, we have made it the most revolting thing you have ever seen.</p>
<p>Right now, although we have lots to show for the development of Xen, we are also very hard at work on both the arctic and Combine sections of the game. Currently, we plan to release sometime in 2018, though that might change.</p>
<p>Some bonus info: We work simultaneously on multiple maps, so it is hard to show perfected designs of those. Please keep in mind that maps are underway and we have more than just models and textures.</p>

<p>I am the Creative Director and Project Manager for this new mod. Although it sounds naive, we are producing a Half-Life 2: Episode Three mod. We currently have a small team of four mappers, a coder, and I, who manages the development of the project. Our goal is to faithfully use the same methodology of making our mod in our design process as Valve once did for the making of the Half-Life franchise. It is to feature puzzles, down time, and most importantly, a lot of fun with the gravity gun. The mod features clever gameplay using the gravity gun that Valve never thought of. We are centric on the gravity gun because we thought it was underused compared to the original Half-Life 2 franchise.</p>
<p>In the mod, the combat and puzzles will be like nothing you’ve ever seen in a Half-Life game. Puzzles will require extensive use of the gravity gun and combat will leave you speechless. You will be able to kill enemies in a whole new way and experience entirely new sections of the Half-Life universe. You will explore the depths of the arctic, the heights of the Combine architecture, and see a renewed version of Xen, Combine infested and all. Make sure to check out <span class="bbcode-i">The Orange Suit Project</span> when it comes out… which may take a while. Which is why we are looking for mappers, modelers, scripters, coders, and graphic designers.</p>

          <title>New weapons?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Of course, there will be the obvious issue of weapon balancing, but can it be done? Adding new weapons and ammo types for them throughout the Black Mesa campaign? Since we’re dealing with marines, some sort of M4 or M16 variant seems like a natural fit. The niche I could see it occupy is that of a more powerful automatic combat rifle with rarer ammunition. Maybe a semi and burst mode for the primary and secondary fire, respectively. Or only burst but with a scope mode, similar to the revolver’s ironsights or the crossbow’s optic.</p>

            <p>It is Barney, just before he had an unfortunate accident considering a pool of liquid coming out a garbage disposal tank near the canteen.<br>
He had to get a really expensive face replacement, that’s why he still owes Gordon a beer as the operation cost Barney all of his money.</p>

          <title>Idea: more faces.</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ToastyToast]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It has been demonstrated that a certain pool of faces is only used by a certain group of models. For example, every character in Black Mesa uses the standard facepool - yet in the Joint Operations mod, there is an edit that replaces the _02 faces for the marines with balaclava textures; AKA a whole new pool of faces. I’ve got no modeling experience, so I have no idea how to make this idea come to reality.</p>
<p>So I propose this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find/create new faces for BM</li>
<li>Make copies of the standard scientist, guard, etc. models, and make them each have their own pool of faces to choose from</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ol>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

          <title>Black Mesa Movie Models</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Judo101]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>I’ve been experimenting with Source Filmmaker and found out that the current models in game don’t have an automated phoneme set.  Other than having to painstakingly assign each sound a movement (and in turn assign the model phoneme expressions), I was wondering if anyone (Probably BM devs) had certain models they used to make the trailer movie?  As they say, “Work smarter, not harder” and it would be extremely helpful to have these models for my project.  I want to make an animated documentary on a map I’ve been working on based on a little story I wrote and showed some friends.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Judo101</p>
<p>(P.S. if this is the wrong area to post this sorry!)</p>
